        <h1>Chapter 1815 Back to the Lawrence family</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before the banquet began, Matty took Amelia back to his residence. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia had previously visited this place pretending to be Skender and remembered it as the house where Sophia used to live. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Lawrence family had several houses in Canada, but Matty preferred to live here. After instructing his sons and grandsons to prepare for the banquet, Matty led Amelia through the garden to the small courtyard she had previously designed. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matty said that this courtyard would be her house in the future, and whenever she wanted to come back, she could stay in the courtyard. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia did not respond and followed Matty, occasionally looking around at the surroundings. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After entering the courtyard, Matty turned to ask her, "Are you satisfied?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia responded emotionlessly, "It's just temporary, there's nothing to be satisfied about." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matty didn't mind Amelia's underlying meaning and said, "No matter how long you stay, being able to come back is the best."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying this, he raised his hand and gestured to the butler standing nearby, "My little granddaughter Amelia is back, arrange dinner." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matty left the position of the eldest granddaughter vacant, leaving it for Skender, which could be considered as a compensation for Skender's identity. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After the butler and the servants left, the spacious living room was left with only Matty and the silent Amelia. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matty noticed that Amelia still felt unfamiliar and uncomfortable, so he had the servant take her back to her room. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Knowing that she was pregnant, the master bedroom was arranged on the south side of the first floor, with a large space and a warm decoration. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matty had mentioned that Sophia loved her daughter very much, so he had Skender design this courtyard for her daughter. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that time, Matty did not know that </span><span>Sumasa</span><span> was his daughter, but he had the courtyard built because Sophia liked it. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia couldn't quite describe her feelings, but she felt that the old man was infatuated yet heartless, and didn't understand how to love, which was quite sad. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After inspecting the room, Amelia asked the servant to leave and took out her clothes from the suitcase, then went to take a shower. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After cleaning up, she thought Matty had already left, but he was still sitting in the living room, waiting for her, saying that he wanted to have dinner with her. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matty had specially hired a nutritionist to prepare meals suitable for pregnant women. Although Amelia didn't feel like eating, she sat down at the table, thinking that if she didn't eat, the child wouldn't eat either. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two of them had only met twice and didn't have much in common, so Amelia buried her head in her meal, while Matty sat opposite her, silently watching her eat. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The old man's eyes, which had been tempered by the years, were usually sharp, but now, as he watched the girl eating her meal gracefully under the light, they were filled with tenderness. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Amelia had never stayed with the Lawrence family, her graceful manner while eating was just like the children of the Lawrence family. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The more Matty looked, the more satisfied he became, and a smile appeared on his lips. "Amelia, if I had known earlier that you were my granddaughter, that would have been great." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then he could have accompanied his granddaughter earlier and given her the best of everything, ensuring she never suffered or felt the slightest bit of injustice. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Amelia finished eating, she put down her knife and fork, wiped her mouth with a napkin, and looked at Matty. "Mr. Lawrence, I'm in the early stages of pregnancy and feel sleepy after eating too much." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matty nodded and said, "Then how about taking a walk outside with me to aid digestion?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia looked at the night view outside and said, "The weather is getting cooler, and my health isn't very good. Catching a cold could easily lead to complications, so I'd rather not." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was very tactful, and after a moment of silence, Matty picked up his coat and stood up. "Then rest well. Tomorrow, I'll take you to meet your grandmother and then we'll attend the banquet together." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia agreed, and Matty left with some reluctance. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though it was just across the backyard, it felt like a galaxy away, close yet unreachable. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After seeing Matty off, the housekeeper asked Amelia if she wanted a masseuse or a beautician, but Amelia declined. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She then sent a message to Eva, "Everything is going smoothly." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva, upon receiving the message, made a video call to see that she was okay, and only then did she feel relieved. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After the two hung up, Amelia put down her phone and sat on the windowsill, lost in thought. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the video call, she had seen Paul sitting next to Eva, rubbing her belly and seemingly telling stories to the baby in her womb. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had also thought that James would do the same when she was pregnant, but now...</span></p></div>
