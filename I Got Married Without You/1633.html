        <h1>Chapter 1633 I might say yes</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva looked into Amelia's clear eyes for a while, slowly releasing her tightly clenched hands. "If he really proposes to me, I might say yes..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had almost been raped, which should have left her with psychological trauma, but she didn't recall any disturbing images from last night. Instead, she accepted Paul calmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>People often say that the body reflects the changes in the mind. Her body liked Paul, which meant that her heart had never let go of him...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since she still had feelings for him, why not take another plunge? Eva wasn't sure why she thought of it as a plunge, but she always felt a lack of security when she was with Paul.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was afraid that after marrying him, he would grow tired of her and abandon her again. What would she do if she faced a second abandonment?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva was fearful inside, but Stella's last words were also a hope for her to give Paul another chance, right?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought Stella wouldn't lie to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Amelia heard Eva say she might accept Paul, she smiled slightly and pursed her lips. "Then let's wait for good news from Paul."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Paul was scared by James and didn't dare to go out. I took James away, so you can catch up with him..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's there to catch up with him for..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva muttered under her breath, but there was a faint smile on her lips, which she didn't notice herself...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia saw it but didn't point it out. She turned and headed upstairs, taking James with her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the car, James was still a bit resentful. "After he gets married, I'll transfer him to Africa..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia smiled. "Honey, He finally won the beauty, let him show off a bit. Don't hold grudges too much."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James helped her fasten her seatbelt and said coolly, "He wants to borrow your Jmissa to propose to Ms. Miller..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia's smile slowly faded when she heard this. "Babe, send him to India for some hand-pulled noodles..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James raised an eyebrow lightly. "Babe, he finally won the beauty, let him show off a bit. Don't hold grudges too much..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia clenched her small fist. "Tonight, I'm sleeping with Grace..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James, who had already started the car, suddenly let go of the steering wheel and grabbed Amelia's wrist. "Babe, I'll do as you say, send him to India..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia coldly snorted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James said, "That is, send him to Africa..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia turned her head and looked out the car window.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing that she ignored him, James smirked and reached out his long arm, pulling her waist towards him with force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Honey, your sister Eva, after marrying Paul, will become your younger sister. Are you happy?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia tilted her head and looked at James.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why don't you call Paul brother-in-law like me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James had originally wanted to change the subject, but when he heard this request, he raised an eyebrow...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He doesn't deserve it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unless he dies, he won't call Paul brother-in-law.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Amelia kept pushing his limits, teasing him repeatedly. "I don't care, you have to call Paul brother-in-law from now on, or I won't sleep with you..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A hint of an unknown smile appeared on James's handsome face. "Then I won't let Paul win the beauty..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia couldn't help but laugh out loud. "Okay, then you can call Paul little brother."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It had been a month since she last laughed, and now that she saw her smile, James's mood improved a lot. "I have a question that I don't quite understand."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia was curious and leaned over, looking at the man who was driving and furrowing his eyebrows. "What question?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James glanced at her lightly. "Are Indian hand-pulled noodles really delicious? Why does Paul have to go to India to eat them?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia couldn't hold back anymore and laughed uncontrollably, huddled in the car seat...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James, who was asking a serious question, looked at her in confusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's so funny?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia straightened up and leaned against James's ear, whispering an explanation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James's handsome face visibly darkened, followed by a hint of disgust in his eyes...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But, to disgust him even more, Amelia took out her phone and played a video for him. After James finished watching it, he couldn't even eat dinner...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he still firmly believed that Paul was the one who should eat that kind of pastry.</span></p></div>
