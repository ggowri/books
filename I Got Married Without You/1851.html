        <h1>Chapter 1851: How Are We Even Family?</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matty had always seen Amelia as a gentle soul, but seeing her angry for the first time shook him, if only for a moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You and James aren't right for each other," he said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We've been together for over ten years through hell and back. Why aren't we right for each other when it comes to you?" Amelia retorted, a smirk playing on her lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"James agreed to leave you for his freedom in a deal with me. He can abandon you so easily, then how is he right?" Matty countered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If it wasn't for you restricting his freedom, threatening my unborn child, would he have chosen to leave me?" Amelia scoffed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James' reluctant decision wasn't because they were enemies, but because Matty put him in a tight spot. The man known for his decisive actions had to compromise, with plans to fight back. He was a good husband, a good father, and no one was more suited than him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If it were me, no matter who or what threatened me, I wouldn't choose to break up. In my eyes, James doesn't truly love you," Matty said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And you? You barged into Sophia's life, stole her away from her first love, but you refuse to marry her. Is that love?" Amelia's eyes were filled with mockery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is my relationship with your grandmother any of your business?!" Matty got angry and Dylan tried to intervene, but Amelia pushed him away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You can't meddle in my affairs, just like I can't meddle in yours!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Amelia, remember, you are my granddaughter, we are family." Matty, with age in his eyes and anger in his heart, glared at Amelia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You restricted his freedom for your own selfish reasons, threatened my child, and deceived me. What kind of grandfather or family are you?!" Amelia scoffed again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matty's face darkened visibly, his hand on the desk clenched into a fist, his veins throbbing uncontrollably in his anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fearful that Matty's rage would harm Amelia, Dylan instinctively stepped forward, shielding Amelia. "Gramps, it's all my fault. I caused the fight. I'm sorry."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matty, having nowhere to vent his anger, found an outlet in Dylan's voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, he sprang up and harshly slapped Dylan across the face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a solid slap.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dylan's face swelled red instantly and hurt a lot. But he gritted his teeth, not making a sound, just turned his slapped askew head and looked up at the furious Matty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Neither of them spoke, their heaving chests a silent testament to the heartbreak caused by a single slap. It was subtle but it disappointed Dylan bit by bit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia wanted to defend Dylan but he held her back. "Amelia, arguing with Grandpa is useless. He won't understand."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sophia was gang-raped to death. For Matty, it was a nightmare that haunted him for decades. If not for his hatred, he might have given up long ago.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matty didn't witness what Amelia went through. He didn't know how important James was to her. All he knew was that James was the leader of the S gang, his biggest enemy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unable to let go of his hatred, Matty kept Amelia, his kin, close with deception, never </span><span>considering the pain his lies and separation caused her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unless Matty let go of his hatred, he could never empathize with Amelia. But it was clear that hatred had blinded him, and he was likely to become more aggressive if Amelia turned against him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dylan didn't want Amelia to bear this hatred. He tried to leave with her, but she resisted, breaking free from his grip and stepping up to Matty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Apologize!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matty, who had calmed down, turned livid at her words. "Do you know what you're saying?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Undeterred by Matty's authority, Amelia pointed at Dylan's face and coldly said, "You slapped Dylan for no reason. Don't you think you should apologize?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dylan was touched by her words but afraid she'd anger Matty. He tried to pull her back. "</span><span>He's</span><span> my grandfather. It's okay if he slapped me. Don't pick a fight with him for me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ignoring Matty, Amelia stared at him with clear eyes. "You lied first, twisted logic later, and now you hit Dylan. How can you be considered our family?"</span></p></div>
