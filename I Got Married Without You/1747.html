        <h1>Chapter 1747 Game Start</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After the players had selected their respective positions, the mechanical sound sounded again:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Please insert the invitation card into the console and confirm your identity.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were two small openings on the desktop, and the console popped up. Johnny stared at the console, some of whom didn't want to insert a card.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Please insert the card within five seconds. Those who have not completed it will be shot.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a curse in her heart, Johnny took out the golden leaf and inserted it into the console.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;The player with the code name 'Dumbass' has been confirmed.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Puff -</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Scar Man next to him, hearing his code name, immediately laughed back and forth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Did you offend the inviter by giving you a stupid code name?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Johnny clenched her fists and stared at the scar man who laughed until his stomach hurt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Shut up.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Your inviter is 1-4, and my inviter is also 1-4. Look at the code he gave me, Scar, it sounds so good.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Johnny was so angry that he swung his fists and rushed towards him. Scar Man quickly retreated a step back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;I won't laugh anymore.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Scar Man raised his hands to surrender, and Johnny turned to face the control console, holding back the raging anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia carefully glanced at Johnny, but she wasn't worried that Johnny would get angry because of the code name.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she didn't expect Erebus to start the game directly after publishing the rules, and during this time, she didn't know how much time it would take, nor did she know if Johnny could resist the urge to go to the bathroom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Johnny, who was extremely angry, had long forgotten about wanting to go to the restroom and now wished to catch Group 1, Group 4, and vent his anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When they each had their thoughts in mind, the mechanical sound of the fourth floor </span><span>space echoed again:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Players, before the first round of the game begins, I&rsquo;ll release the game's win or loss mechanism.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Rewards for the first round of the game: first option, 5 billion dollars bonus, second option, running a horse.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When playing electronic music, the clean and tidy desktop becomes a screen, displaying bonuses and horse racing videos.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia still didn&rsquo;t understand what running a horse was. After seeing the video, she quickly moved her eyes away and looked at Johnny.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was expressionless, staring at the group of naked women dancing on horseback, as if he didn't feel anything about it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Scar Man next to him was just like the men in other game halls, excited and whistling, only Amelia couldn't adapt and lowered her head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Am I not the only female player here?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Then you can choose a bonus after you win.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Johnny could answer Amelia's question, he was interrupted by the Scar Man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;How do you know she will win?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia couldn't help but ask Scar Man, who was quite elegant and spread out her palm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When she looked suspiciously at Scar Man, the screen image disappeared and slowly presented other images, while the electronic sound reappeared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;The punishment for the first round of the game will be for our robot Mech X to remove one arm from the player.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The screen demonstrated how the robot Mech X could instantly tear off a player's arm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia moved her gaze away from the screen and looked at the red gate across from the table.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If these players made the wrong choice, the robots behind the red gate would come out and take off their arms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't until this moment that these players felt nervous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Erebus didn&rsquo;t give any players a chance to buffer and started the game directly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;First round of game starts now.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After the mechanical sound was played, the screen on the desktop faded and four black boxes quickly popped up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;The question for the first round of the game, which box is the apple in?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Players, please make a choice and press the number keys to confirm.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Players who have not made a choice within five minutes will automatically admit defeat.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Players who heard the rules clearly took a step forward and stared at the square box.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;The number keys are located above the black square box. After making a selection, press the number keys above to confirm.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After the game started, the entire game hall was constantly surrounded by the ticking countdown sound.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In this urgent environment, everyone began to be cautious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, mechanical sounds also sounded in the behind the scenes viewing area:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Please start betting.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The black clad people sitting on the luxurious sofa all picked up their hands to bid the money to the invitee.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Venom placed his bet on the invited player 'Dumbass' and 'Scar', he looked towards positions 2-9.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cobra, who was sitting straight on the sofa, didn't make any movement, just stared at the screen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Venom stared at him for a moment, then slowly moved his gaze away and repositioned it on the big screen.</span></p></div>
