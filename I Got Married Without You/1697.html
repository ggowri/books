        <h1>Chapter 1677 The new rule</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Herb glanced at James, who seemed uninterested, with a hint of malicious intent in his eyes. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, let the Clark family surrender this round first, but whoever reaches this stage must finish the final round, with new rules for winning or losing. How about that?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before James could respond, Paul immediately slammed the table.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I agree, that's settled then!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No matter what, they had to protect his ship and the two robots!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James didn't have much of a reaction, he simply reached out and pulled Amelia closer to him, then lifted his cold gaze towards Johnny.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shall we continue?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Johnny's gaze briefly flickered over the hand placed on his waist before quickly looking away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There is no winner yet, of course we should continue."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James moved his hand from Amelia's waist up to the back of her head and gently pressed, causing her to nestle into his arms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then let's continue."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although it was a bit embarrassing to embrace each other in front of so many people, Amelia obediently cooperated with James.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She nestled in his arms, looking up at him, which Johnny found inexplicably irritating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He clenched his fist, averted his gaze, and stopped looking at Amelia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, James had warned him multiple times of his sovereignty, and it wouldn't be good to keep looking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he couldn't control himself from looking at her, he certainly couldn't gouge out his own eyeballs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Herb couldn't see the hidden tension between James and Johnny, he was only focused on the ongoing gambling game.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Evans, for the final round, let's raise the difficulty level, shall we?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva frowned disapprovingly at Herb.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What kind of tricky idea do you have now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Herb drew two jokers from the deck of cards.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Evans, you and I will draw cards first. Whoever draws the big joker gets to set the rules for winning and losing, and the rewards and punishments can be announced after the game ends."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After speaking, Herb raised an eyebrow at James. "What do you say, Mr. Evans, do you dare to gamble with me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva felt that things were getting a bit excessive. "Mr. Clark, with the rules you're setting, won't the loser end up losing everything?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Herb looked at Eva. "Amelia's sister, don't worry, the stakes won't exceed ten million, I know my limits."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Pausing for a moment, Herb's gaze shifted to James, who was as steady as a rock. "Besides, with both sides having a 50% chance of winning, how do you know Mr. Evans will lose?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This statement left Eva speechless. James had an overwhelming presence and luck, who knows, maybe he could draw the big joker and she wouldn't have to say anything anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The others who had been eliminated felt a mix of excitement and worry, but James remained calm and raised his head. "Let's start."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing James enter the game, Herb smiled and hurriedly collected the two cards on the table, wanting to shuffle them himself, but Paul snatched them away. "Let me do it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Herb was taken aback. "Let me do it instead."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul sneered, "I noticed something off about you earlier. Are you cheating?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Herb became angry. "I didn't shuffle the cards just now, so how could I be cheating?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul countered, "Even if you didn't just now, you're eager to shuffle the cards now, isn't that a clear sign of cheating?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Herb's hidden intentions were exposed, but he still insisted, "I'll shuffle them behind my back..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul interrupted, "It doesn't matter where you shuffle them, it's useless."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Herb retorted, "You..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Both of you, shut up!" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Johnny impatiently shouted, "Give it to the waiter."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The waiter standing by was startled, "I..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was about to say "I dare not," when Paul forcefully handed him the cards. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Trembling, the waiter took the cards from Paul, turned around, and continuously swapped their positions before placing them back on the table.</span></p></div>
