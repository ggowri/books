        <h1>Chapter 142 The People of Weil Family Is Really Good at</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia was still shocked that Jackson would come forward to seek justice for her when she heard Lena put the blame on her.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia didn't want to pursue the matter initially, but Miss Weil's accusations made her angry.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as she was about to ask Lena what she had said to her, a flat voice suddenly came from behind.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Miss Weil, have you been learning to confuse right and wrong in the past few years?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man behind her was dressed in a black suit. Standing under the light, he looked a little bright.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Amelia heard his voice, she knew who he was. She was grateful he stood up for her, but she dared not look back.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James glanced at Jackson, who was holding onto Amelia's hand, with a gloomy expression.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James slowly walked down the stairs and stood in front of Lena,</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I just happened to pass by when Miss Weil humiliated her."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James didn't show her any respect and exposed her lie, causing Lena to pale.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lena still wanted to argue, but James glanced at her with highly indifferent amorous eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lena had never seen such a terrifying look before. Even though his eyes were beautiful, the look was enough to afraid her.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lena was so scared that she immediately shut her mouth. She stood rooted to the spot, not daring to move.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only then did Harry realize that something had happened to his sister. He quickly pushed through the crowd and rushed over.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Harry could ask what had happened to Lena, James gave him an indifferent look.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Weil family are really well-educated."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying that, James left with his bodyguards.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Watching the show from the side, Paul looked thoughtfully at James's back.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James was indifferent and would never speak up for unimportant people.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, he actually stood up to teach Miss Weil a lesson. It was really incredible.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul glanced at Amelia, who was standing intimately with Jackson, and his expression darkened slightly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It must be because of her that James made an exception for her.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't expect this woman to be so capable. Not only could she get Jackson to protect her, but she could also get James to help her.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul wanted to go over and teach her a lesson, but after thinking for a while, he gave </span><span>up.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if James didn't want her, he shouldn't be the one to teach her a lesson.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul turned around, took his assistant, and left with James.</span></p></div>
