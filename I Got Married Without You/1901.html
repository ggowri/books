        <h1>Chapter 1901 I’ve destroyed the system</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James looked at Matty with indifference and coldness. "What? Can't find Master Davies, so you plan to manipulate me with the chip to find him?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Holden said that Matty had been searching everywhere but couldn't find Master Davies. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed like he had vanished without a trace. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So Matty had no choice but to come find James, right? </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matty felt helpless about James' thoughts. "I didn't have such malicious intentions as you think. I wanted to talk to you about the chip to let you know that I have destroyed the detonation system. You won't be controlled by the chip anymore." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These words made James pause for a moment. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After returning from the Cloud territory, he had tried to destroy the detonation system of the chip but failed. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, hearing that the chip's creator had personally destroyed the system, he was somewhat shocked. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matty continued, "Although the detonation system is destroyed, the chip contains a virus. If it is removed, it will cause an infection. I'm afraid this thing will stay in your brain forever." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James was well aware of all this and didn't respond to Matty's words. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matty added, "It may affect your lifespan, but I don't know the specifics." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This chip was designed to control people and hadn't been tested on humans before. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James was the first, so the ultimate outcome was unpredictable even for Matty. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing that James remained silent, Matty fell silent as well. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes glanced towards Amelia, who was talking to Dylan in the distance. "She hasn't come to hold me accountable yet, which means you haven't told her about the chip." James was afraid that Amelia would worry and be afraid, so he hadn't told her. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a man's responsibility and a way to show his love for Amelia. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But... "The virus in your brain chip may erupt at any time, and she will eventually find out. If that day comes, I hope you can explain that it was Nick, not me, who implanted the chip in your brain." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Matty was involved in the development and research of the chip, he wasn't the one who tested it on James. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, he didn't know that James was Amelia's husband or that Amelia was his granddaughter. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From the beginning, he admired James' intelligence and only saw him as someone who could be used and controlled. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That's why he had sent Nick to subdue James. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the intentions were based on not knowing each other, and they couldn't be confused. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But no matter what, Matty couldn't escape from this matter. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Amelia found out, she would definitely confront him. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matty felt that his relationship with Amelia was already strained enough, and he didn't want it to turn into enmity. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could only ask for James' help. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James couldn't be bothered to respond to Matty's actions. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He turned and walked away, his back displaying a sense of aloofness as he headed towards Amelia. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Watching James' solitary and proud figure walking towards Amelia, Matty sighed deeply, feeling a hint of regret. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he also felt somewhat innocent and didn't linger any longer. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He turned and left. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia was mainly asking Dylan how she could avoid continuing to work for Matty. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dylan looked at his concerned sister but smiled without saying a word. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia became anxious and shook his arm. "Dylan, say something." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dylan smiled and spoke in a gentle and refined manner, "Now that Erebus has disbanded and there is no one left to support Grandfather, what would happen to him if I were to leave?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had been raised by his grandfather. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although he had discovered his grandfather's eccentricity and ruthlessness as he grew up, no matter what, Matty was still his grandfather. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was different from Amelia. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matty had never raised or taught Amelia, never invested any effort in her. Amelia could abandon him, but he had been raised by Matty and couldn't become a disloyal person. Dylan's sense of righteousness and filial piety proved his goodness. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The more Amelia got to know him, the more she felt that Dylan was a good person. "Then you must protect yourself and not rush into everything." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia knew that Matty was seeking revenge on Master Davies, and it would inevitably lead to bloodshed. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was afraid that Dylan would sacrifice himself for Matty, which was something she didn't want to see. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Otherwise, she wouldn't have advised him to leave. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Dylan had his own thoughts and opinions that Amelia couldn't easily interfere with. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She could only use a thousand words to advise him, as she cherished the brother who had helped her. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dylan raised his gentle fingers and gently stroked Amelia's head. "Don't worry, I can at least live until 99 years old. By then, maybe I'll even see your grandchildren." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dylan's gentle tone and the way he treated his sister with indulgence warmed Amelia's heart. "Dylan, I'm grateful to you. If it weren't for you, my husband and I wouldn't know when we would be able to reunite." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mentioning this, Dylan felt inexplicably guilty. "If we hadn't started Erebus and done those outrageous things, you and your husband wouldn't have been separated. I'm sorry for that." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And there was the chip in James' brain. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matty had warned not to mention it, so Dylan had to help keep it a secret. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He felt sorry about that too.</span></p></div>
