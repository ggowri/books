        <h1>Chapter 1987 Treat Her as a Daughter</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing these words, Beth, who had just turned eighteen, instinctively clenched her fists. But as Alexander stepped up, she didn't know what to say and could only grit her teeth to bear it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beth swore in her heart, "Alexander, don't let me seize the opportunity. Otherwise, I will definitely make you regret it for life." At that time, Alexander didn't know what emotions were and didn't care at all about Beth's revenge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he went downstairs with Grace on his back, he kept saying that Grace was too fat. She was so angry that she grabbed his hair. They almost made a scene all the way to the wedding car...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at these two people, James shook his head lightly, took Amelia's hand, followed the wedding procession, and headed to the hotel...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grace had no father, so James took on the role of father. She would hold him and step onto the wedding stage. At that time, James would hand her hand over to Phil...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before reaching this point, Grace, standing outside the door, looked up at the man on her side with her exquisitely makeup. "James, from childhood to adulthood, you never allowed me to touch you. There's nothing you can stop me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James, dressed in a black suit, lowered his eyes, scanning toward Grace, who was wearing high heels but still not as tall as him. "Just once."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the wedding day, Grace rolled her eyes more than in her lifetime. "James, why are you like Alexander? On my wedding day, you did not say anything nice!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James thought for a long time before coming up with a better blessing. "I hope you and Phil can get along for a life. Don't let me see you off for a second wedding in a few years..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grace was speechless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She held James' arm and stepped onto the wedding stage in front of everyone's attention. Then, he put Grace's hand into Phil's hand and lowered his voice, warning Phil, "If you're not good to her, I'll kill you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grace burst into tears with this sentence, and her blurred vision was filled with James' gentle and well-intentioned expression. James had always treated her like a daughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was moved and then hugged James, who was planning to step down, in a very small yet incredibly sincere voice, whispering, "Thank you, James..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James turned slightly, glanced at her from the side, and couldn't help but gently stroke her hair with his broad and thick hands. "You cried so much that your makeup was ruined and all of it rubbed against me. It's too dirty."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grace would have thought it was James who despised her as she was a child, but as she grew up, she seemed to feel James' unique love from these words. She did not feel aggrieved at all but rather very reluctant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grace did not know why she always felt that James may leave her after arranging her marriage. It made her sad.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They arranged for Grace to get married, and the next step was to prepare for Alexander's coming-of-age ceremony. But the ceremony would take another three years. So, James did not know if he could still live until that time...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, he knew that the top priority was to cultivate Alexander's management skills. Paul and those younger brothers would all age. James knew that only by nurturing the next generation could they maintain the Evans Group that Dominic valued.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Dominic did not treat James well, even after his death, James never went to the memorial service for many years, but he still agreed with Dominic's idea of keeping his family business. So, he arranged according to Dominic's ideas.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Originally, Alexander intended to pursue a career in high-tech research. He was puzzled as he heard James' proposal. "Father, with you and Uncle Paul here, the Evans Group will definitely develop very well. Why do you still want me to work at the Evans Group?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James sat on the sofa. He was nearly fifty, but time cleverly avoided all traces on his face, making his appearance still the same as before. Perhaps a few wrinkles crawled up the corner of his eyes, but it didn't affect his charisma as he grew older...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James had been so handsome all his life. It made Alexander feel that his father would never grow old. But James told him, "I have a chip in my head. Maybe in the near future, it will take away my life. Before I die, I have to cultivate the next heir of the Evans Group..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This news undoubtedly seemed like a fierce shot in Alexander's heart. He was shocked and couldn't believe the news, staring blankly at James. "Father... what are you saying?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James didn't want to tell Alexander about this until he died, but Alexander ultimately would grow up. So, James made up his mind and forced him to grow quickly. "I don't want to talk about the past. All you need to know is that I need you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those who were capable always had to take on more responsibilities. Alexander was destined to be trapped in the Evans Group, completing what the heir should have done, starting from having such a high IQ.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was still immersed in the chip incident and couldn't believe everything. Alexander stood up and walked up to James, withdrawing his hand. "You must be lying to me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He dared not believe it. But Amelia pushed the door in and denied his disbelief. "Your father didn't lie to you..."</span></p></div>
