        <h1>Chapter 1923 Dominic died</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ryan restrained himself and maintained a sense of propriety.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite knowing that Amelia no longer loved him, he remained steadfast and silently loved her. This kind of character is truly precious.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because of this preciousness, James lifted his head and looked at Ryan's upright figure.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His handsome eyebrows slightly furrowed, his eyes bloodshot, and a complex emotion welled up within him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the doors of the ICU were about to close, James's cold and indifferent voice reached Ryan's ears.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ryan paused, turned around, and looked at the man sitting by the hospital bed. In front of others, he was proud, but in front of Amelia, he was humble.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was evident that his love for her had reached its peak, which was why he expressed his gratitude so sincerely...</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ryan tried to find doctors everywhere and brought them to the hospital.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, every doctor who examined Amelia's condition gave the same response as the old doctor - the chances of her waking up were slim.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The doctor Johnny found was no exception.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The doctors brought in by the Lawrence family, the Evans family, and the Clark family all said the same thing.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matty, frustrated by the doctors' opinions, vented his anger on Dominic once he was discharged.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After waiting for Dominic to leave the hospital, Matty planned to run him over with his car.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since he had no intention of living, he thought it would be good to take someone who refused to die with him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But before Matty could step on the gas pedal, he saw Dominic's Lincoln car, which had just left the hospital, being hit by a large truck and overturned.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The accident was severe, with the truck almost crushing the car. The front of the car was completely flattened.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing the news of Dominic's accident, James didn't even blink his eyes, let alone attend the funeral.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His entire focus was on one thing - finding a doctor to save Amelia...</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But every time he consulted a doctor, his hopes were crushed by their answers. To make matters worse, the baby in the incubator was deteriorating.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man who stayed by Amelia's side in the ICU day and night received a critical condition notice every day.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At first, his hand trembled when signing it, but eventually, he became numb...</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't even have time to take a look at the child. He didn't care about the gender.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The only thing his eyes could hold was Amelia lying unconscious on the hospital bed...</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He personally took care of Amelia every day, not allowing anyone else to do anything for her, even if it meant collapsing in the intensive care unit multiple times due to exhaustion.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He refused to let anyone touch Amelia, not even Eva.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James was stubborn and obstinate, and no one could persuade him otherwise. Everyone couldn't help but feel sorry for him when they saw him receiving critical condition notices for the baby one moment and taking care of Amelia the next.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Johnny, who frequently visited the ICU, thought that James's love was similar to his own.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, when he saw the exhausted man who cared for Amelia day and night, he realized that they were worlds apart...</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Ryan no longer blamed James.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every time, he stood at the entrance of the ICU, silently watching the person he loved being attentively taken care of by someone who loved her even more...</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Time passed quickly, and two months flew by in the blink of an eye.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fortunately, the babies under the critical condition notices survived the dangerous period and could now leave the incubator, living like normal babies...</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva held the child and came to see James and Amelia.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After two months of treatment and feeding, the child had grown quite a bit...</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Would you like to hold him?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva held the child and handed him to James, but the man with lowered brows never extended his hand.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He only glanced at the child before averting his gaze.</span></p></div>
