        <h1>Chapter 1926 Amelia woke up</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The hospital bed was positioned by the window, with the glass slightly open, allowing a gentle breeze to accompany the falling snowflakes.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The breeze lightly moved the white curtains, brushing against the bedside and bringing a refreshing sensation.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feeling the change in temperature, Amelia shifted her gaze away from the ceiling and slowly turned her head towards the window.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Outside, there was a pure sky with snowflakes falling gracefully like frost petals...</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She moved her fingers, wanting to reach out and catch a snowflake that drifted in, but she realized that any movement caused pain.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It started from her fingertips and spread throughout her body - her stomach, heart, lower body, and even her head.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The pain was so intense that her body convulsed and tears streamed down her face...</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the entrance of the ward, Dr. Lewis entered with a medical kit in hand and saw Amelia crying.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He froze for a moment before quickly rushing over to her, making sure she was truly awake before shouting, "Eva, Mrs. Evans is awake!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva, who was washing towels in the bathroom, heard Dr. Lewis's excited voice and quickly rushed out.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When she saw Amelia looking at her with open eyes, Eva's nose tingled, and the emotions that had been building up inside her burst out.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Amelia!" She ran over, tears streaming down her face, and grabbed Amelia's hand. Overwhelmed with joy, she sobbed, "You're finally awake!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It had been six months since Amelia last woke up. Even she was on the verge of collapsing, let alone James.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thankfully, Amelia finally regained consciousness.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Eva crying like this, Amelia wanted to reach out and wipe away her tears, but she couldn't move due to the pain.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She could only part her lips and say, "Eva..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She could only manage to call out a name. Her dry and sore throat couldn't produce any more words.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dr. Lewis quickly noticed and opened the medical kit, taking out a few silver needles and inserting them into her arm.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the needles went in, the pain in Amelia's body instantly lessened, but it still hurt, especially with the tubes inserted into her body, making her uncomfortable. She struggled to remove the tubes, but Dr. Lewis held her hand firmly. "You just woke up, you still need treatment to fully recover. Endure it for now."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia endured the discomfort and looked at Eva, whose face was tear-stained. "Eva, I'm so thirsty. Can you get me a glass of water?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't console Eva, but gave her something to do, diverting her attention.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As expected, Eva, who was crying, gradually stopped after fetching the water.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She returned with the cup, scooped a little water with a small spoon, and put it into Amelia's mouth.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps she was really thirsty, as Amelia drank several spoonfuls before saying she didn't want any more.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva put down the cup, restrained her excited emotions, and held Amelia's hand again. "Amelia, for the past six months, I've been hoping every day that you would wake up."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Six months? No wonder Eva cried like that when she woke up.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia felt a little embarrassed and apologized to Eva, "Eva, I'm sorry for causing you so much trouble..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva shook her head and reached out to stroke Amelia's short hair. "Let's not talk about whether it's troublesome or not. As long as you wake up, even if it shortens my life by ten years, I'm willing."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps because they were close, Amelia noticed the fine lines at the corners of Eva's eyes and couldn't help but be surprised. "Six months isn't that long. How did you get crow's feet?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva, still in an excited state from Amelia waking up, was taken aback by the question.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She then reached out and touched her own face. "At my age, getting crow's feet is normal, right?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia, who had just woken up, shouldn't be concerned about Eva's aging. It should be James.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Why was she asking about Eva's crow's feet? It was strange.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia furrowed her brows slightly, but she didn't pay much attention to Eva's aging.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought it was due to overwork and turned her gaze towards the ward. "Eva, where's Ryan? Why isn't he here?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wait a minute.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shouldn't the first person Amelia cared about be James? Why was she asking about Ryan?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva felt that something was off the more she thought about it. "Amelia, why don't you ask about James first?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing this name, Amelia's heart twinged, but she had no recollection in her mind.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She raised her eyelashes slightly and asked in confusion, "James... who is he?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As these words came out, Eva froze in place, and even Dr. Lewis stopped what he was doing.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva couldn't believe it and held onto Amelia's hand tightly. "Amelia, don't you remember James?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia felt unfamiliar with what Eva was saying. "Eva, I'm only eighteen and still in school. How could I be married? Besides, if I were to get married, it would be to Ryan."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Something wasn't right.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The first person Amelia should be concerned about waking up shouldn't be James. Why was she asking about Ryan?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva felt that something was off and said with disbelief, "Amelia, James is your husband. You and him have been through so much together to get to where you are now. How could you forget him?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia felt a headache coming on and questioned Eva, "Should I remember him?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For some reason, at this moment, Eva's worry wasn't about Amelia, but about James, the man who was willing to do anything.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he found out that Amelia didn't remember him, would he die?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva's swollen eyes filled with tears again as she said, "Amelia, James is your husband. You and him have been through so much together to get to where you are now. How could you forget him?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia found Eva's words unfamiliar. "Eva, I'm only eighteen and still in school. How could I be married? Besides, if I were to get married, it would be to Ryan."</span></p></div>
