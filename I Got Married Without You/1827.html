        <h1>Chapter 1827 Michelle</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Since we've finished our deal, come downstairs with me and let's end tonight's banquet." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matty reached out his hand gentlemanly and placed it in front of Amelia. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia looked at the hand, which had been stained with blood, and couldn't help but smile bitterly. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had wanted to live a peaceful life, free from </span><span>worries</span><span>, but in the end, she </span><span>participated in</span><span> the game. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suppressing her anger and disappointment towards Matty, she placed her hand in his blood-stained palm, and played along with him to act out the final scene. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all the guests had left, Matty instructed the girls adopted by the Lawrence family to take good care of Amelia and not to hold any grudges against her. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Apart from the Erebus matter, Matty treated Amelia quite well. If he wasn't the founder of Erebus, perhaps, in the long days to come, Amelia would have truly regarded him as her grandfather. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There </span><span>were</span><span> a total of four girls adopted by the Lawrence family. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One of them worked as a brand designer at Stephanie's company and was quite gentle and obedient. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Earlier</span><span> in the bathroom, Amelia overheard the adopted girls discussing her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When they expressed their dissatisfaction, the gentle girl spoke up and rebuked them. This led to the other three girls becoming upset and attacking the gentle girl, eventually revealing her secret crush on Dylan. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The gentle girl, feeling embarrassed, denied the crush and warned them to be more cautious, lest they be expelled from the Lawrence family. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After speaking, she grabbed a tissue and pushed past the other three sisters, leaving the bathroom in a huff, leaving the other three to start berating her. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the height of their scolding, Amelia pushed open the inner door of the bathroom and walked out, calmly washing her hands at the sink. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The three sisters were all stunned to see her, and Amelia, expressionless, finished washing her hands and slowly dried them with the hand dryer. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't say a word, leaving the three sisters terrified and embarrassed, apologizing to her, saying it wasn't intentional, and that they welcomed her back. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia said, "I don't care whether you welcome me or not, but I can't accept your apology for treating your younger sister so harshly." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying this, she withdrew her hand, turned and walked out, and as she did, she saw Dylan looking at the gentle girl, </span><span>who was </span><span>holding a child and walking to the car with her husband. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From Dylan's eyes, she could tell that he loved the gentle girl, Michelle, the fourth adopted daughter of the Lawrence family. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Michelle hadn't married and had a child, </span><span>Amelia</span><span> would have told Dylan that Michelle had a crush on him, and they both had mutual feelings, but Michelle was married, so she couldn</span><span>&rsquo;</span><span>t say anything</span><span> about it</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After watching Michelle leave, Dylan looked at Amelia. "I thought you would break off with him after finding out</span><span> about the truth</span><span>, but I didn't expect you to still hold his hand and come downstairs to see off the guests." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nonchalant, </span><span>Amelia smiled, "Impulsiveness doesn't solve problems; only forbearance can help achieve one's goals."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dylan was about to say something when Matty called out, "Dylan, come to the study." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matty was about to settle accounts with Dylan</span><span> after everyone else had left</span><span>. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia was worried, </span><span>saying, </span><span>"I'll go with you." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dylan patted her shoulder, "You go back and rest, gather your strength, and then achieve your goal. I'll </span><span>deal with it</span><span>." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After giving his instructions, he turned and went upstairs, and as Amelia watched his figure ascending the stairs, she suddenly felt that </span><span>he</span><span> </span><span>was indeed different from others. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The length of his strides was matched by the frequency of his heartbeat, and the terror of his grandfather was not something an ordinary person could endure. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he was used to it. </span><span>It</span><span> wa</span><span>s </span><span>just that this time, the matter at hand was bigger than the usual mistakes he made, yet Dylan didn't regret his actions. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He gathered his courage, pushed open the door to the study, and at that moment, the curtains on the balcony were drawn, and the study </span><span>instantly got</span><span> dim. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matty was sitting on the sofa, holding a </span><span>whip</span><span> in his hand. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he saw Dylan enter, he pointed to the center of the floor and said, "Kneel down."</span></p></div>
