        <h1>Chapter 1742 You're not going to the restroom anymore</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But his laziness seemed Dumbassish to Amelia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She endured impatience and lifted Johnny's suit jacket to help him find the key.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;You probably didn't bring the key&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Impossible&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Johnny furrowed her brows and flipped through the layers and pockets again, but still didn't find any.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Someone from Erebus must have taken my keys&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He clenched his fists in anger and said, "These bastards, it's best not to be found by me, otherwise I'll kill each one I see.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia frowned and said, "They even brought my box, can't they just take your keys.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Johnny looked at Amelia with a surprised expression on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia raised her chin towards him and said, "Over there.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Johnny followed her gaze and happened to see a box in the corner.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't believe it: &ldquo;Even the box is allowed to come in, why only took my key? Intentionally targeting me?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Apart from the key, everything else on his body was also searched, such as his phone, shrink knife, poison, tracker, and other defensive items, all of which were missing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Electronic devices would naturally be taken away, Amelia didn&rsquo;t care, but if the key to the handcuffs was taken away, wouldn't she have to be tied to Johnny all the time?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Johnny seemed to be aware of this and looked at Amelia, who happened to be looking at him. The two of them looked at each other and then moved away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They leaned against the wall, and after a long silence, Johnny slowly opened his mouth and said, "Do you have a knife in your box?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before entering Erebus, she spilled a pile of cash because of Johnny. After entering Erebus, he lost the key again, causing them to be tied together now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia naturally had resentment and didn't want to talk to him at all, but out of politeness, she responded to him, "No.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Johnny asked again, "Do you have any other tools</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia glanced impatiently at him and said, "There's nothing, don't ask anymore.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Johnny lowered his eyes and stared at the handcuffs. After a while, he silently said, "Amelia, I want to go to the restroom.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia took a deep breath, suppressed all her emotions, and coldly said, "Hold on.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Johnny knew he could only endure it, so he reluctantly stopped speaking and looked around the room, only to find two invisible doors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Holden once said that Erebus respects the invitee, so there were basically all the necessary physiological equipment available.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before the game started, he didb&rsquo;t have to worry about what Erebus will do to them. The only thing to worry about was how to open this damn handcuff.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He tugged at the steel hard handcuffs and bit them with his teeth. Unable to open them, he forcefully pulled Amelia to the room to search for tools.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Two invisible rooms next to each other, one was a shower room and the other was a restroom. Apart from the dazzling white shower nozzle and toilet, there was nothing, not even a window.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After turning around, Johnny kicked the wall in anger and said, "When I find them, I will definitely chop them into meat sauce.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia took a deep breath to suppress her anger, "Think of a way to open this first.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Johnny became impatient and said, "If I knew how to open it, wouldn't I even be able to use the restroom?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia was currently a pregnant woman with sensitive emotions and unable to control her temper. She also sent out her spleen and says, "I don't care, if you don't open this, Don't go to the restroom again.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Speaking of this, Johnny's original needs were suddenly awakened, "Amelia, could you please make some sense? It wasn't my intention to tie me up with you.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia scolded him, "If it weren't for your bad idea, could we be tied together</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Johnny was just about to answer when a mechanical electronic sound suddenly came from the room&mdash;&mdash;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Dear players, welcome to Erebus. You are requested to place the Golden Leaf on the console and confirm your identity.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The voice fell to the ground, and two entrances similar to inserting bank cards popped up on the wall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia and Johnny temporarily stopped the civil war and walked up to the control desk.</span></p></div>
