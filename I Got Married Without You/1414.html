        <div>He searched online for Edith's photos, pulled up a picture, enlarged it, and compared it to the person in the telescope.The person in the photo had light makeup, while the person in the telescope had heavy makeup, different in appearance but the same person.Could he have really mistaken her earlier?</div>
