        <h1>Chapter 1769 I'm Elvira</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After leaving the house, Amelia suddenly fainted. When she woke up, she was lying on the deserted island she had come from, with her suitcase and a note with the address to claim the prize.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Erebus would leave the cash at the designated location and then let the successful players go there, probably to avoid being traced.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She kept the address, put it in her suitcase, and then got up to go to the shore to see if she could find a ship. She didn't find a ship, but she did run into someone she didn't want to see.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brandon is now the leader of some of Erebus's black-clothed men. He was standing on the beach with his people, waving at Amelia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Amelia, long time no see."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia knew what Brandon was going to do when she saw him, so she turned and ran. Brandon raised his hand and a few black-clothed men quickly caught up to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia ran pretty fast and quickly disappeared into the bushes, but the black-clothed </span><span>men were calm and followed her path, using their knives to clear the bushes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were all taller than Amelia and could see her movements clearly. They quickly found her, put a black hood over her head, and then carried her on their shoulders onto the ship.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When the ship sailed into the deserted sea, Brandon finally had the black-clothed men remove her hood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as her vision cleared, Amelia looked at the man standing on the deck and knew he was her biological father, but he was willing to kill her for his other daughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brandon looked at Amelia's eyes and furrowed his brows slightly. Every time he saw her, he felt familiar, especially her eyes, which were like Emily's and a little like his own. It was strange and uncomfortable, but he still saw the resemblance and put away the knife in his hand, raising his chin at Amelia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Amelia, because you look a little like my daughter, I'll go easy on you. I won't torture you. You can jump off by yourself."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia looked at the deep blue sea and remembered </span><span>Sumasa</span><span> saying in a video that Brandon had pushed </span><span>Sumasa</span><span>, Skender, and her, who had just been born, into the sea for the sake of Emily and her mother. She couldn't believe that this would happen again when she grew up. It was ridiculous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia, who was powerless, brushed off the dust on her body and climbed up from the deck, without any fear, and walked step by step to Brandon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why did you help Sarah back then?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as the word "Sarah" came out, Brandon was instantly stunned, and his dilated pupils were full of astonishment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How do you know her?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia raised her face slightly to let Brandon see clearly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You haven't seen my mother's true face, have you? She looks just like me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This news was like a bolt from the blue, and it took Brandon a long time to react.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You... are you Skender?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia shook her head and said lightly, "I'm Elvira."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brandon couldn't believe it and looked Amelia up and down. It turned out that she was the baby he had taken from the nurse's hands in the delivery room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brandon was full of shock, but when he saw Amelia's face, he couldn't help but feel guilty: "Where is your mother... now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking of her mother's life, Amelia couldn't help but tear up: "She passed away a long time ago."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brandon was stunned for a moment, thinking that she must hate him to the bone, but she had never shown herself or retaliated against him. He didn't expect that she had passed away a long time ago.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then... what about your sister Skender?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He still had some feelings for Skender, after all, she was his first child, and Skender had always been smart and obedient to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking of her childhood, running over to him and jumping into his arms, Brandon couldn't help but reach out and grab Amelia's hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tell me, where is Skender? I want to see her."</span></p></div>
