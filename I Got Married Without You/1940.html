        <h1>Chapter 1940 James hugged the baby for the first time</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James, still unsatisfied, reluctantly let go of Amelia and turned his disappointed gaze towards Paul, who was leaving with Eva.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He coldly glanced at Paul and said, "You should come in and watch, so you don't miss out on the fun."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul couldn't help but sigh, "Look at you, with your courage, one would think you're about to do a live broadcast."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James calmly raised his distinctively jointed fingers and smoothed out his shirt that had been messed up by Amelia.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He then leaned back against the single sofa and raised his chin at Paul, saying, "I dare to do a live broadcast, do you dare to watch?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul, who had already walked in, pulled a chair and sat across from James, saying, "Is it free? If it's free, then I reluctantly become the first audience in your live stream."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing this, Amelia covered her face.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What kind of conversation were these two having? Can they really talk about such things openly?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia tugged at the corners of her stiff mouth and felt guilty as Eva handed the baby over to her.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She took her own baby and said, "It's all my fault. I was in a coma for half a year and didn't even name the baby..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul immediately exclaimed, "Amelia, naming the baby can wait. Let's just call him Buzz Lightyear for now."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Amelia could respond, the man beside her, as solid as a mountain, spoke coldly, "Next time, remember to bring Ken and Barbie so that Amelia and I can see what they look like now..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul: ...</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For some reason, he felt that Buzz Lightyear didn't sound as bad as Ken and Barbie.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Regretting his words, Paul suddenly had an idea and his eyes lit up, "Oh, James, I'm really sorry. My child was born earlier than yours, so in the future, Buzz Lightyear will have to call my child 'big brother' or 'big sister'."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James remained calm and said, "In that case, your child can call my child 'boss'. The order of age won't matter then."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as James said this, Paul's wide smile froze. The baby in Amelia's arms burst into laughter as if understanding what the adults were saying. The baby was incredibly smart.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing the baby's laughter, James raised an eyebrow, feeling unusually happy. He reached out his finger and gently touched the chubby chin of the baby, asking, "Are you happy being the boss?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The baby couldn't answer, but waved its little hand and grabbed James' finger.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment it grabbed his finger, the laughter became even louder and couldn't stop.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing the adorable baby, Amelia couldn't help but lower her head and kiss the baby's tender forehead.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She said, "Baby, do you understand what Daddy is saying? Why are you laughing so happily?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After she finished speaking, she looked at James, who also had a faint smile on his face, and asked, "Isn't our baby cute? Do you want to hold him?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>During the time Eva visited her in the hospital, she mentioned that James had been avoiding the baby, not even holding him once.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How could a father not hold his child? Regardless of whether he wanted to or not, Amelia directly picked up the baby and handed him to James, saying, "Hold him."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In response to Amelia's hopeful gaze, James reached out his hand and took the baby, but his tall body suddenly stiffened. The baby felt boneless, so soft that it didn't seem real.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Worried about hurting the baby, James became nervous and only held him for a moment before returning him to Amelia.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul and Eva thought he still disliked the baby, but only Amelia could tell that he was nervous.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She couldn't help but curl her lips and say, "Use your right arm to support his little head and use your other arm to support his body. That way, you can hold him securely."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James had to extend his hand again and take the soft baby, following Amelia's instructions to hold him securely.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Whether it was because of Amelia's guidance or his own adjustment, he felt less nervous this time.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He even found it hard to let go after holding the baby in his arms.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With one hand holding the baby, James gently touched the baby's chubby face with his fingertips.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When his fingertips touched the delicate and fragile skin, a warm feeling surged through his heart.</span></p></div>
