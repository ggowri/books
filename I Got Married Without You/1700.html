        <h1>Chapter 1700 When I’m not by your side</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia walked up to Herb.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Clark, you've tried to borrow the game twice now, not only embarrassing me but also showing a lack of respect. Don't call me sister anymore." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What she meant was that brothers wouldn't treat their sisters like this, but Herb didn't think about the concept of "respect or disrespect."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He just wanted to take advantage of the opportunity to mess with James, without considering that it would embarrass Amelia. Now he realizes it, a little too late.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sis, I don't know who will draw the Joker. Even if it's me in the end, I would suggest kissing James just to prank him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, he didn't expect Amelia to be the one who drew the card. Caught up in the excitement of the game and thinking about his previous loss, he didn't consider gender or marriage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He definitely didn't mean to disrespect Amelia, but who cares what goes on in his mind? By saying those words, he showed a lack of respect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Herb didn't intend to say much more. He leaned his face closer, "Let's fight, but once we're done, let me go home..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James slapped his swollen face hard and then slowly pulled back his hand. "If there's a next time, I'll break your legs."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Herb, who had been subdued, looked at James and couldn't help but think that the way he spoke was similar to how Johnny scolded him. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And why did he feel like... James' eyes resembled a little girl's? Although his memories were fuzzy, this feeling seemed familiar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he stared at James, the man took off his gloves and coldly ordered, "Throw him into the sea."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those three cold words instantly interrupted Herb's wandering thoughts. "James, why don't you keep your word?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James put down his gloves, took out a wet wipe, and calmly wiped his fingers before looking up at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Forget that the rules of winning and losing are determined by me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In other words, he could do whatever he wanted. Herb's face turned red with anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Evans, you're ruthless!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James threw away the wet wipe and held Amelia's hand, leaving the top deck of the open-air cabin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia trembled a bit and looked at Herb being carried by several bodyguards onto the deck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Honey, are you really going to throw your cousin off the ship from such a high place?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James suppressed the coldness in his eyes and replaced it with a tender look as he lowered his gaze to Amelia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just scaring him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Throwing someone from the top of the ship would undoubtedly result in certain death, with internal organs shattered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing his words, Amelia breathed a sigh of relief. "He won't dare to do it again."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James suddenly remembered something and gradually slowed his pace until he stopped, turning to gaze at Amelia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If next time, I'm not by your side and he treats you like this again, be more ruthless and just slap him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia looked up at him with a puzzled expression, examining him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Where are you going when you're not by my side?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James felt a sudden pain in his heart at the thought of their upcoming separation. Unable to control himself, he raised his hand and embraced her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What I mean is when I'm not at home."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia, who had been holding her breath, slowly relaxed and reached out to hug James around the waist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry, if Herb dares to do something like that next time, I'll beat him with a baseball bat."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia's voice, filled with gritted teeth and a grinding of her little tiger teeth, made James couldn't help but curl his lips into a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After laughing, he raised his slender hand and stroked her soft hair, expressing all his reluctance in the touch of his fingers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva's wedding night was quite unique. For example, when Paul held Eva and was about to kiss her, a howl came from the top floor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His movement paused, and the screaming from upstairs stopped. He lowered his head again, just as his lips were about to touch Eva's, a pig-like scream came from above.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul felt that James wasn't torturing Herb, but torturing him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Frustrated, Paul decided to ignore it and held Eva close, listening to the screams from above while kissing her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After being scared all night, Herb was kicked off the ship by the bodyguards.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Johnny, who had been following the ship, caught the miserable Herb and turned in the opposite direction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zack, standing on the deck, looked at the massive ship and narrowed his eyes slightly. He hadn't found an opportunity to talk to James alone yet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't know when he would go to Erebus. He could only go back and ask Holden for information, then quietly follow when the time was right.</span></p></div>
