        <h1>Chapter 1642 Death by a thousand cuts</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the gathering, Paul deliberately kept everyone guessing about who he was going to marry. Everyone was getting anxious and kept pouring him drinks until he was drunk. Only then did Paul announce that he was going to marry Eva...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His friends knew who Eva was, and when they heard that Paul was going to marry her, they were shocked. They thought Paul was crazy for wanting to marry someone who had been divorced and even hurt him before. They tried to advise him to be more sensible, reminding him that there were plenty of good women waiting to marry him. They told him not to make a rash decision.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Drunk and unhappy, Paul got angry and kicked over a chair. He started cursing at his friends who were trying to reason with him, and he almost started a fight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Anthony hadn't stopped him, Paul would have already fought with his friends who were badmouthing Eva.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After finishing his rant, Paul felt that the gathering was boring. He grabbed his coat and stumbled away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony, feeling down, didn't follow him. He sat alone in the corner, feeling lonely, and continued drowning his sorrows with alcohol...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dizzy and disoriented, Paul stumbled out of the private room and ran into Elsie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed like she was deliberately waiting for him. When she saw him, she didn't seem surprised at all. In fact, she walked towards him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Paul, I heard you're getting married?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elsie looked a bit sad as she looked up at Paul.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The person in front of him seemed to split into two and then overlapped again. Paul couldn't see clearly who she was, but he knew she was a woman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was about to have a wife, so he needed to keep a distance from other women. He bypassed Elsie and walked unsteadily towards a nearby corridor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He almost tripped, but Elsie quickly grabbed onto him...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let me go."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't have any contact with other women. Eva wouldn't be happy about it. Paul's mind was only filled with thoughts of Eva. He pushed Elsie away forcefully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elsie, pushed aside, watched Paul's swaying figure and her elaborately made-up face darkened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul had already deleted her. She couldn't see his posts on social media, but she knew his friends. Yesterday, she heard from his friends that Paul had announced his engagement on social media. She had already guessed who Paul was going to marry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking about the person she couldn't have, who was easily won over by Eva, Elsie felt furious, trembling with anger. She couldn't help but step forward and follow Paul closely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had drunk too much and when he walked out of the hotel, he fell to the ground. Elsie saw him fall and felt that this was her chance. She quickly ran over and helped him up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She arrived at Paul's apartment before Eva did. She came here mainly because there was a butler at the villa and Paul had instructed the butler not to let her in. She had heard from his friends that Paul had a large apartment in the city, and he had been living there recently because of the Evans' project, which was close to the company.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elsie had the address and originally planned to intercept Paul here, but she couldn't intercept him. Tonight, she finally found an opportunity to catch him while he was drunk, and she had to make good use of it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With this in mind, Elsie supported the tall Paul and used his fingerprint to open the door. She laid him down on the bed, and as soon as she finished, she heard the doorbell ring.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elsie hurriedly walked out of the master bedroom and took a look. She saw Eva standing outside the door, and her face suddenly darkened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't know about Paul's apartment, but Eva seemed familiar with it, which meant that Eva was more important to Paul than she was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Realizing this, Elsie felt resentful. Why could this older woman win Paul's heart while she couldn't?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elsie became angrier and angrier as she watched Eva try the password several times and fail. When she saw Eva trying to enter the password, she quickly turned around and hurried towards the master bedroom...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva tried several passwords, all of which were incorrect. She remembered that when she was dating Paul, he had sent her the password, so she took out her phone and found the note.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She entered the numbers according to the password in the note, and the door opened...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Eva entered, she called out Paul's name, but no one responded. She walked towards the study, thinking that Paul must be busy with his computer and couldn't hear her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, as she crossed the hallway, she heard a woman's moaning coming from the master bedroom - the kind of sound made during intimate moments.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva's heart skipped a beat, and her footsteps instantly froze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She slowly turned her body to face the master bedroom and stood there for a full two minutes before gathering the courage to take a step forward and walk towards the closed door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she got closer, the woman's voice became louder...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The door was not closed, and through the crack, Eva could see the direction of the bed, but it was covered with a blanket, so she couldn't see clearly who was on it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She realized that something was happening inside, but she didn't know where she found the courage. She raised her trembling fingers and pushed the door open...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What she saw inside was Elsie sitting on the bed, moving under the blanket. She made pleasurable sounds, and the entire bed was shaking with her movements...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even in the dim light, Eva could clearly see the side of the person underneath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Eva's heart felt like it had been pierced by a thousand arrows.</span></p></div>
