        <h1>Chapter 1764 A broken promise</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia knew nothing about Mr. Shawn's identity, and when she asked about it, James only revealed some information after he was in danger. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She understood that the leader of S had to be cautious, and she also understood why James didn't want her to get involved in danger. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But shouldn't couples tell each other everything? Why did he always keep things from her and make decisions for her?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James opened his mouth to explain, but suddenly felt a sharp pain in his head, his face turning pale. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, Amelia saw the name "Erebus-Inviter-2-7" on Emily's clothes as she walked over and naturally took James's arm. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia was waiting for James to push Emily away, knowing that her husband had a phobia of being touched by other women.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After waiting for about 30 seconds and seeing that James didn't push Emily away, Amelia looked down at her stomach and said, "I won't sign. Are you using her to provoke me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emily sneered, "Amelia, can't you see that James doesn't want you anymore, that's why he's divorcing you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia didn't look at Emily, only at James. "If she's threatening your life, then I'm prepared to die when I came here to find you. We promised to be together for life, through life and death, never to be separated. Do you remember?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James's eyes slowly moved to her stomach. He had seen her taking pills to protect the baby, seen her curling up from hunger, and seen her sitting on the bed, caressing her stomach. He knew she was carrying their child. How could he selfishly let her and the baby accompany him into danger?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After standing still for a moment, James suppressed all his emotions, raised his cold and indifferent eyes, and looked at Amelia. "I remember everything I said to you, but things are different now. Just take it as </span><span>a broken promise</span><span>."</span></p></div>
