        <h1>Chapter 1896 Someone else’s understudy</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Zenith had not appeared, Gigi could have suppressed her longing for a year. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But since Zenith appeared, it was like a raindrop falling into calm waters, causing ripples. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite everyone's advice that he was not Zack, Gigi was convinced that he was Zack, just that Zack didn't remember her. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This made it different, as she firmly believed that Zack had come back to her in a different form. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zenith approached Gigi, who was still kneeling in front of the church, thanking God for returning Zack to her. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, before she could fulfill her vow, her chin was held up by a slender finger. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gigi looked up into Zenith's eyes and saw the mole in them, but she overlooked it. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She heard Zenith ask her, "You have moved my heart, but you constantly think of </span><span>someone else</span><span>. I don't want to be a substitute for someone else. If you have even the slightest place for me in your heart, then I will stay. If not, then I will leave." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gigi's response was, "Zack, you are my fianc&eacute; and the father of my deceased baby. How could you be a substitute for someone else?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She saw the sparkle in Zenith's eyes fade as she spoke, and silently, he left for a while. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gigi went crazy looking for him but couldn't find him, so she cried and begged Johnny for help. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Johnny didn't want to see Gigi go crazy. After all, Zenith was not Zack. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But because of Zenith's appearance, Gigi had the motivation to keep going, and he couldn't help but be selfish. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Johnny investigated Zenith and confirmed their blood relationship through DNA testing. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Based on their appearance, Johnny speculated that they were twins. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zenith's stepmother, fearing the influence of having twins, bribed the doctor on the night of the difficult birth of the main wife. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They exchanged a stillborn baby for the live one and sent the live baby away on a ship, drifting towards his own destiny. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Zack hadn't encountered Master Davies on the ship, he would have starved to death as an infant. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he hadn't met James, he would have died during training. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His seemingly bright but tumultuous life was all thanks to the help of others. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That's why Zack was willing to dedicate his wandering life to those who had helped him. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Johnny found Zenith and personally went to see him. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He happened to see Zenith in the church, holding a watering can and sprinkling water on flower petals. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He bathed in the sunlight, with a lowered gaze, just like Zack, except that Zack's hands were stained with blood, while Zenith's hands were untainted by the world. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Johnny approached Zenith and told him about Zack's existence, asking if he was willing to replace Zack and love Gigi. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zenith was a kind-hearted person. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After learning about his brother's lonely life and tragic death, he was on the verge of tears but didn't want to replace his brother's love for Gigi. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Johnny didn't force him and left. In the following days, Johnny comforted Gigi. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After listening, Gigi didn't say anything, but when she fell asleep, she leaned against the door frame and asked, "Brother, am I not worthy of happiness?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Johnny also thought the same way. It was painful to love someone you couldn't have. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But later, he thought that his parents had lived a sinful life and it would eventually be someone's responsibility to pay for it. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He just hoped that he would be the one to pay, rather than his sister, who had lost both her loved one and her baby. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gigi didn't insist on Zenith anymore. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She continued to kneel in front of the church, reading the Bible every day. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She believed that as long as she focused, Zack would surely come back to her. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was during a flower parade that Zenith happened to see Gigi in the bustling crowd. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That one glance felt like a first encounter, and it struck a chord in his heart, causing an irresistible attraction. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unable to sleep, Zenith looked up at the night stars. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That night, something happened. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zenith dreamt of a man who looked exactly like him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After waking up, Zenith couldn't remember the details of the dream, but he knew that the person had said many things to him. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The most memorable was the request, "Zenith, please take care of my fianc&eacute;e in my place."</span></p></div>
