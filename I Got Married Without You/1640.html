        <h1>Chapter 1640 Kate threatened Eva</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva couldn't change the past, but she could make sure she wouldn&rsquo;t do anything that would make her regret in the future. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mrs. Evans, if I marry him, I won't treat him the way I did before. I will give him everything and love him wholeheartedly. I&rsquo;ll cherish him, protect him, and never betray him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Eva said those, she was sincere. After all, she took relationships seriously. She devoted herself to her ex-husband, and even to Jayden, she believed that if she agreed to be someone's girlfriend, she had to fulfill her promise. Not to mention Paul, who was different in her heart. So if they were to get married, she would definitely treat him better.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing that Eva wasn't giving up, Kate changed her approach. "Actually, my son Paul </span><span>isn't that great. He used to be a playboy, surrounded by scandals. But that was before he met you. After being with you, he has changed a lot. At least he hasn't been involved in any scandals frequently. I appreciate you for that. But are you willing to bet?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sitting on the couch with her back against it, Kate suddenly sat up straight. She placed her fair hands on the table, palms together, and looked directly into Eva's eyes with a calm and serious expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He was spoiled by us since childhood. He always wants to get what he desires immediately, just like when he wanted to marry Elsie back then. He made a big fuss, but soon after, he got tired of it and didn't want to marry her anymore. Can you guarantee that if he suddenly proposes to you now, it's not just a momentary impulse?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kate knew the hidden truth about Elsie, but intentionally said this to make Eva give up. She had investigated Eva and knew that she had given everything to her ex-husband, only to be betrayed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She knew that women who had experienced such things would naturally be more cautious in handling relationships and marriages. Kate hit Eva's softest spot, and no one knew Paul better than his own mother. Even his mother thought it was just a momentary impulse, so Eva naturally was scared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had also wondered if Paul only wanted to marry her out of a sense of responsibility after they slept together. But when she was in danger, Paul silently stood by her side. He should want to marry her because he loved her, right?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Elsie was Paul's first love, a fleeting romance. It was said that back then, he caused a lot of trouble for the Evans Family just to marry her. Would he treat Eva the same way?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Later on, Paul fell out of love, just as Kate said. He got tired of it and didn't want to marry anymore. Would he be like that with her too?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Eva's mind was in chaos, Kate lightly tapped the table. "Ms. Miller, based on my understanding of my son, if he proposes to you now, it's definitely just a momentary impulse. And when he gets tired of it later, he might want to divorce again. Instead of that, you'd better cut off his thoughts first to avoid experiencing another betrayal."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kate was quite formidable. With just a few words, she could guide Eva to give up. But Eva felt that even if she wanted to give up, it should be Paul himself who said he didn't want to marry, not her cutting off his thoughts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't want to be the bad person in this situation, so she gritted her teeth and refused. "Mrs. Evans, I'm sorry, I don't have the power to influence his thoughts like that."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Kate heard her say this, she smiled again. "Ms. Miller, I'm offering you a trade. I'm sure you're not interested, after all, you don't lack money, and certainly not Paul's love..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kate reached out with her well-groomed hand and grabbed Eva's hand, holding it gently in her palm and patting it softly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Miller, if you let change Paul&rsquo;s mind, I will guarantee the success of your career. </span><span>It will thrive endlessly. If you can't do it, well, I might have to do something myself. Of course, I won't go as far as to make you go bankrupt. After all, you're Amelia's friend, and I won't do that out of respect for her. But I can make your life difficult."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After witnessing Kate's abilities, Eva felt even more sympathetic towards Anthony. "Mrs. Evans, no wonder Edith and Anthony broke up. With a mother like you, it's impossible for them to stay together."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Using gentle methods to hit someone's weak spot and using force to cut off their path, wasn't that how Anthony was threatened back then?</span></p></div>
