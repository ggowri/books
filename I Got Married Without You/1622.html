        <h1>Chapter 1622 An eye for an eye</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mike just came out of the study when he heard these words, his fair face immediately darkened. He didn't expect that after dealing with Erin, Andrew would come along. His life seems to be a constant challenge...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mike's cold gaze fixed on Andrew, who slowly raised his head. "Was it you who told Stella that Erin's ashes were scattered at sea?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mike showed no expression and smirked, "James, I just told our cousin the truth when she came to pay respects to our older brother. Is that wrong?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Andrew pulled out the knife stuck in the sofa and flicked the blade with his fingertip. "You're not wrong. If it weren't for you telling Stella the truth, she wouldn't have died."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mike wisely chose not to respond and instead put on a childish expression as he ran to </span><span>Thomas.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dad, now that Andrew is coming back to be the heir, does that mean I don't have to attend management classes anymore?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To encourage premature growth, Thomas didn't care about Mike's young age and directly arranged for him to attend management classes at the age of seven.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you think he can just come back whenever he wants?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thomas looked coldly at Andrew, who came to collect debts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I personally went to pick you up back then, but you refused to come back. Since you're so principled, why did you come back now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Andrew sneered, "I want the inheritance rights of the Simpson family."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once he obtained the inheritance rights, he planned to sell all of the Simpson family's shares and donate everything. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Karen wanted her son to inherit the rights so that she could enjoy life after getting out of prison. But once he had her out, she wouldn't even be able to find the Simpson family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And Thomas, if it weren't for his lust blinding him, how could Karen have taken advantage of the situation? Such a person should pay the price for his actions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After notifying Thomas, Andrew immediately went with his men to buy up the Simpson family's shares. After all, the Simpson family's uncles were not so united and could easily be dismantled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once he obtained enough shares to rival Thomas, he wanted to see how Thomas would continue to control the Simpson family and how he would show off in front of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Andrew was able to do all of this with James' influence supporting him. With him backing him up, everything went smoothly. In less than a month, he acquired a significant number of shares...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now Thomas was desperate, and Mike was even more desperate. He had been giving Thomas advice, both openly and secretly, hoping to persuade Thomas to kill Andrew...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now Andrew had power and influence. Even the Collins family of Imperial Capital was assisting him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thomas believed that Ryan had betrayed the friendly alliance of the Simpson family, but in reality, Ryan was avenging his close friend, so he helped Andrew behind the scenes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Andrew, with the support of both sides, stayed in Imperial Capital. While he brought down the Simpson family, he also made sure to send valuable things to Karen in prison.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For example, he forged evidence that Thomas had a lover and even had a child with her, perfectly embodying the saying "treat others as they treat you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Karen was trembling with anger after seeing these things. She wanted to rush out and kill Andrew, but he just coldly watched her, letting her go insane...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He not only made Karen experience the pain Erin's mother felt back then, but he also deliberately sent the "lover" and "lover's child" to visit her in prison from time to time...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not long after, Andrew received news of Karen's mental breakdown, but he had little </span><span>emotional reaction. He believed it was just retribution...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Whatever Karen had done in the past, she had to pay the price for her actions. He could have simply killed her, but slowly tormenting her was the best revenge...</span></p></div>
