        <h1>Chapter 1861: Daley Parsons</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Did you figure I'd make it back alive?" James' dark eyes were icy, his voice low.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"With your skills, surviving wasn't a long shot," Master Davies replied, handing his cane to Andrew and settling on the sofa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So why are you here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Since you know about Darkness, might as well tell you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And if I didn't know it existed, were you planning on keeping it from me forever?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Darkness isn't exactly a charity," he dodged the question, his tone indifferent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The setting sun painted James in a golden hue, but the man bathed in light felt no warmth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>So</span><span> you're not just keeping secrets, you're lying. Think I'm that easy to manipulate?" James questioned coldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've invested more in you than in Holden and Emelyn, there's no deception in that. Why would I manipulate you?" Master Davies denied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Really?" James scoffed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Master Davies didn't respond. James strode forward, looking down at him, "S existed long before, but you erased all evidence, claiming it was created for me. Isn't that deception?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Faced with the man bathed in light, like a judge, Master Davies hesitated, "Yes, I did deceive you. But I thought it didn't concern you, so I didn't tell you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James thought he'd be unaffected by Master Davies' confession, but hearing it made him disappointed, "Is it irrelevant to me, or am I just not useful enough for you to tell me the truth?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Master Davies fell silent, "James, Darkness was established by my father's generation. It's history, so there's no need to use you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But you knew Darkness killed Sophia, leading Matty to form Erebus and hunt S. Isn't that using me?" James retorted coldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're definitely my </span><span>prot</span><span>&eacute;g&eacute;, piecing together the whole picture from scraps of info. You're ready to stand on your own," Master Davies didn't deny, he merely stated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thanks for the training, but I'm not quite there yet. After all, I only know part of the story. I still need you to fill in the details," James' voice was icy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even in a war of words, you don't give an inch. Impressive," Master Davies chuckled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After his praise, Master Davies shifted his gaze from James' face to the couch across from him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's sit and chat."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The deep, cool man stood still for a few seconds before taking a step and sitting across from Master Davies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he sat down, a ray of sunshine separated the two. One sat in the dark, the other bathed in sunlight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man in the sunlight looked as if he was edged with gold, making Master Davies seem even more bleak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Master Davies looked at James across from him, slowly touching his black hat brim, and began in a faint voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Before Sophia met Matty, she had a first love, Daley Parsons, the rising star of the Parsons family of North America."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My father said Daley was renowned handsome."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Unfortunately, a rising star is no match for the overshadowing Lawrence Family. Daley was crushed in the mud when he met Matty."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Matty's father always told him to take what he wanted, so Matty, being greedy by nature, took Sophia from Daley."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Daley couldn't bear it, harassed Sophia a few times, even shot at Matty. Matty, who had never been shot before, had a killing intent after getting shot."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"With a swipe of his knife, the beautiful young Daley died in a sewage ditch. One of the witnesses was my aunt, Zelene Davies."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She had to work hard to marry Matty, like leaving Sophia's belongings to create the illusion that Sophia killed Daley. With just a little push, Sophia was hit with a disaster."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Daley's father, Bernard Parsons, never liked Sophia. He thought she abandoned Daley to climb the Lawrence Family ladder, even killed Daley, and blamed the pain of losing his son on Sophia."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bernard, the so-called rising star, was actually just a thug on the streets of North America. The aristocratic families there looked down on him for gaining status through violence."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even though he was despised, Bernard was quite capable of gathering thugs. After finding out his son was 'killed by Sophia,' he formed the Darkness to hunt down their family."</span></p></div>
