        <h1>Chapter 1931 James was desperate</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it weren't for Paul rushing in and telling everyone, James' chip in his brain, infected with a virus, would have erupted and almost killed James.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva was shocked by this chip, while Andrew and Peter were furious when they found out that the chip was implanted in Erebus.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Those bastards in Erebus, they were so cruel to Mr. Evans!" Andrew and Peter exclaimed.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was something in his brain, not to mention whether the virus would erupt or not, it must have been excruciatingly painful.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But James didn't say a word, and they only found out now.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The hospital discovered the chip in James' brain, and it was impossible to hide it anymore.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The entire Evans family soon learned about it and rushed to the hospital.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By the time James woke up, he faced the furious members of the Evans family. The man lying in the hospital bed didn't react at all.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He just turned his head and looked out the window at the snow falling heavily.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only Eva knew that he was hurt by Amelia, so instead of anger, she felt nothing but pity. But she didn't know what to say.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After everyone left, Eva approached James and comforted him softly, "She has temporary amnesia, she will remember."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James' thick eyelashes trembled slightly, then drooped, covering the hope that flickered in his eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed that he cared about something other than Amelia's amnesia, but he wasn't sure what it was.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps he knew, but he felt that he was being too petty.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, she ended up loving him. Why should he care about who she loved the most?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maybe he was afraid that Amelia's temporary amnesia would become permanent. That's why James cared.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, Ryan was a cautionary tale. He lost the person he loved the most because of amnesia.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What would James do if Amelia pushed him away completely because of amnesia?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking of this, a sense of despair and hopelessness overwhelmed James.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought that if Amelia had already pushed him away, what else could he do? Maybe he should just die, so he wouldn't feel the pain or care anymore...</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The despair and hopelessness in his eyes made Eva unable to bear it any longer. "Paul, take care of James. I'll go check on Amelia and the child first..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul nodded and followed Eva out, holding her arm.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After finding out about Amelia's condition, he furrowed his brow. "What should we do now? Should we tell Amelia about the chip in James' brain?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva was also hesitant. "The doctors said we should let Amelia recover physically first before stimulating her memory. Maybe we should wait for a while. I'm afraid she won't be able to handle it and fall into a coma again. Then everything James has done in the past six months would be in vain."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul thought for a moment and replied, "Okay."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He reminded Eva not to overwork herself and to remember to take breaks. Eva obediently nodded and said, "Okay, I'll go now."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The couple, one taking care of James and the other taking care of Amelia, also had three children to look after.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had been busy and overwhelmed for the past six months, especially Paul, who had to manage the company on top of everything.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Due to fainting, the chip in James' brain had shifted and embedded itself deeper into the area where he had previously had a brain tumor. However, the chip remained intact.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After evaluating the situation, the doctors told Paul that as long as they didn't tamper with it, the virus inside the chip wouldn't erupt. As for how long James could live, it was uncertain.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What they said was the same as what the previous medical team had said, so Paul didn't bother to consult further.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As long as the virus didn't erupt, James would have more time, but...</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He lifted his gaze and looked at the figure turned away from him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span> Although he couldn't see James' expression, he could sense the despair emanating from him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For the past six months, James had been sleepless, staying by Amelia's bedside day and night.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He would sit there for the whole day until he collapsed from exhaustion. Only then would he lie down next to the bed and take a short nap.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A normal person would have given up long ago, but he, with his exhausted body, still went to seek help from gods and Buddhas.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul was too busy to witness it himself, but he heard from Andrew how this man, who had never believed in religion, kneeled before countless deities.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The James he remembered was always rebellious and aloof. He never showed such a desperate and agonizing pain.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul wanted to reach out and pat James' shoulder, but he didn't dare to touch him. He just lowered his voice, filled with pain, and reassured him, "James, as long as you and Amelia have a child, you will never be separated."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now Paul wasn't worried about Amelia, he was worried about James.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The uncertainty of the chip in his brain could take his life at any moment. They needed to find a solution.</span></p></div>
