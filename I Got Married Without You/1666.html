        <h1>Chapter 1666 The voice recorder</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva stepped out of the elevator and turned the corner into the lobby, where she bumped into Elsie, causing her to slow down her steps. Elsie saw her, took off her sunglasses, and approached Eva step by step.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Miller, there are some truths that I think you should know. Let's find a place, and I'll tell you." Elsie said, facing Eva after just finishing her explanation and now revealing more truths. Eva couldn't help but feel skeptical about Elsie's credibility.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't have time, and I don't want to hear your so-called truths." She tried to pass by Elsie and leave, but Elsie stopped her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Eva, if you want to marry Paul in confusion, then it's up to you." Elsie said, taking out a voice recorder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But I don't want to see you deceived." She handed the voice recorder to Eva.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is the evidence of what Kate forced me to explain after I broke up with Paul." When the cold voice recorder fell into Eva's hand, it sent a chill through her body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you saying that your explanation just now was forced by his mother?" Eva asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes." Elsie nodded without changing her expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If I didn't say this, I would be killed, and my parents would suffer as well." To ensure its authenticity, Elsie rolled up her clothes, grabbed Eva's hand, and placed it on her ribs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Feel it for yourself, several of them are broken, and also..." Elsie extended her soft and limp ring finger under Eva's eyelid.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My finger is permanently fractured." She then opened her high-collared shirt, revealing a patchwork of scars to Eva.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"All these places were where Kate's bodyguards beat me." Elsie said with a resentful expression in her eyes and a mocking smile on her lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I only had a relationship with her son, and she went this far." she continued.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And the reason she did this was to help her son win you back..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Eva, in this game, you won, and I lost..." Elsie said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't believe it." Eva said, although her hand holding the voice recorder tightened instinctively.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Listen to it first." Elsie's eyes showed pity for Eva.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva stared into her eyes for a few seconds, then returned the voice recorder to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Recordings can be faked. Who knows if you're trying to deceive me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you think the recordings are fake, you can confront Kate." Elsie said fearlessly and confidently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Facing Elsie's fearlessness and assurance, Eva, who was already confused, became even more disoriented.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elsie, seeing Eva's confusion, couldn't help but sneer inwardly. But on the surface, she raised her hand and pushed the voice recorder back to Eva.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I brought the voice recorder in advance before they came to kidnap me because I had a real relationship with Paul. I suspected they would come to settle the score with me, so I thought it wouldn't hurt to be cautious. I didn't expect it to come in handy..." Elsie said lightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing the words "I had a real relationship with Paul," Eva's heart skipped a beat and then sank.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After standing still for a while, holding the voice recorder, Eva turned and quickly walked out of the hospital ward...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She sat down on a garden bench outside, and opened the voice recorder...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sound of Kate ordering the beating, Elsie begging for mercy, and the bodyguards' rough actions... All these sounds came out of the voice recorder, sending shivers down Eva's spine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So... the so-called explanations, truths, and honesty were all driven by a mother's love </span><span>for her son.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And Paul...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Paul probably doesn't remember due to being drunk and thinks he didn't do anything wrong. That's why he kidnapped me, hoping to extract the truth, but what I said was the truth. He just didn't believe it..." Elsie said, sitting down beside Eva, who had been following her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He doesn't believe it, and naturally, his mother doesn't either. Only under duress did I confess..." Elsie calmly explained.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I did not agree to Kate coming to explain things to you unless it was for the sake of my parents." Eva, clutching the voice recorder, looked at the woman beside her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If it was for your parents, why did you come to me? Aren't you afraid that I would give the voice recorder to Mrs. Evans?" Eva asked, trying to maintain a facade of calmness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Because I don't want you to marry Paul." Elsie looked at Eva with a sense of resentment in her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I love him very much, and I thought that as his first love, I could win him back. But I didn't realize that he had already started to have feelings for you, and he had forgotten about me, his first love. But..." Elsie paused, her eyes gradually turning red.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why is it that you, someone who came later, can win Paul's affection, while I, his first love, was forced to leave by his mother? I can't accept it. So even if it means my parents will suffer because of it, I don't want you to marry him!" She didn't even try to hide her jealousy towards Eva; instead, she exposed all of her resentment in front of her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"At the same time, I'm betting on your kindness, that you won't expose me in front of them with the voice recorder."</span></p></div>
