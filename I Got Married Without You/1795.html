        <h1>Chapter 1795 An address to get reward</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sorry for making you both worry." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We're not worried, it's mainly Frank who's aged a whole year from worrying." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Peter was trying to comfort Amelia, but Andrew interjected unexpectedly. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He was already very old." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Andrew was intentionally being disruptive, which made Peter clench his fists and glare at him. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, in front of Amelia, they couldn't start a fight, at most they would just ignore each other. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia didn't know what they were bickering about, and just apologized to them again. Both of them quickly waved their hands, saying they understood her. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After exchanging pleasantries, Paul then asked about the main issue. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Amelia, how is James doing now? Is he injured?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia knew they were all very concerned about James, so she didn't show the sad side of her in front of Eva, and just earnestly answered Paul's question. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He's not injured and has become the mastermind behind Erebus." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing this, the tension that had been building up for days was finally released. "James is really amazing." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul was full of pride. It seemed that James's success was the </span><span>most worthy</span><span> of boasting about. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia also acknowledged this, but quietly lowered her eyelids. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Andrew saw this and thought that Amelia was hiding something, so he became nervous. "Madam, are you not lying to us?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia snapped out of her despondency. "He's really fine." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wasn't injured and looked healthy all over, so he was fine. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Brook said that Emily is also in Erebus, but she hasn't exposed Mr. Evans's identity. Is she up to something bad?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking of the way Emily looked at James, Amelia subconsciously shook her head. "She still loves James, that's why she hasn't exposed his identity." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, Mr. Evans is currently safe?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He should be safe." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James becoming the mastermind behind Erebus was not only due to Emily's efforts, but also the approval of the person behind the scenes. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The person behind the scenes must have seen James's abilities, which was why he became the mastermind behind Erebus. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia felt that as long as someone valued his abilities, as long as he didn't reveal his identity, he would be safe. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"When will he come back?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was Peter's most pressing question. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since Holden brought back Zack's broken bones and the news of Mr. Shawn's death, S </span><span>had been in chaos. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Master Davies managed for a few days, then handed over the mess to Holden and Emelyn, while he went to investigate the person behind Erebus. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Peter always felt that Master Davies knew something but didn't tell them. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't know." Amelia really didn't know when he would come back. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Given Mr. Evans's progress, he'll probably come back after he sees what the founder behind Erebus looks like, right?" Andrew asked uncertainly. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Maybe." Amelia's response was also uncertain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She only knew that James had become the mastermind behind Erebus, which meant that the people from Erebus wouldn't do anything to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The only danger was if Emily knew his identity. Thinking of this, Amelia advised them. "If possible, you shouldn't give up on finding Erebus. I'm afraid that Emily might go crazy one day and expose his identity, which would put him in danger." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite her anger and disappointment, Amelia still cared about James's safety. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Later, she thought that as long as James was alive, they could part ways, and it wouldn't be a big deal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you have any other clues, Madam?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Erebus gave me an address to get my reward. Does that count as a clue?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Andrew nodded excitedly. "Yes, of course it does!" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia looked at Johnny, who had been silent the whole time. "Can I give it to them?" Only then did Johnny realize that Amelia thought he was concerned about her reward and was asking for his opinion. "Give it to them." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Johnny inwardly complained: "I have plenty of money, do I really need these billions of dollars?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia took the phone Andrew handed her and wrote the address in the notes. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Andrew and Peter got the address, they informed Holden and Emelyn and then immediately set off. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After they left, Dylan, who had been waiting outside the door for a long time, couldn't wait any longer and knocked on the door. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Amelia, can we talk for a moment?"</span></p></div>
