        <h1>Chapter 1900 Shall we talk about the chip?</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James's cooking was slow, and it wasn't until dusk that he came out with a plate and placed it on the table. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were several dishes, and Amelia didn't dare to eat them, but Zenith had no choice but to try. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James looked calm and somewhat confident as he picked up a knife and fork and handed them to Zenith, saying, "Give it a try?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zenith reluctantly reached out and took them, then tried to cut into the steak. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After struggling for a while without success, he gave up on the steak and turned to another dish. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a yellowish lump that looked like curry sauce, with the aroma of curry but a less appealing appearance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zenith had no appetite, but he still tried to be polite. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He took a small spoonful and put it in his mouth, only to feel a strong urge to vomit. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He managed to hold back the nausea, forced himself to swallow the yellow curry sauce, and then quickly spat it out into a tissue before throwing it into the trash can with a smooth motion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia couldn't help but wonder if James had secretly learned cooking from the household chef before coming here. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Otherwise, how could Zenith eat it? </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite Amelia's doubts, James became even more confident. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He picked up a plate from the side and placed it in front of Zenith again, saying, "Why don't you give it a try?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Knowing that Zack liked sweet food, James had intentionally added a lot of sugar to this dish, believing that Zenith would surely love it just like Zack did. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zenith stared at the dark blob of dessert in front of him and sighed inwardly. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He reluctantly picked up his fork and took a small bite. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, he couldn't hold back and quickly spat it out into a tissue, then drank several glasses of water to wash away the taste.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After finishing the water, Zenith looked at James with clear, bright eyes, just like Zack used to. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said, "Mr. Shawn, what you made is not just bad, it's something even a dog </span><span>wouldn't eat."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing Amelia's concerned question, Zenith wiped his lips with a tissue and took the water glass James handed him. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After drinking several sips, he smiled and said, "If you don't mind, Mr. Shawn, I would like to invite you to Barcelona in the future to cook a meal for Zack. Of course, you'll have to improve your cooking skills, or else my stomach will suffer."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia laughed at Zenith's last comment, and James raised an eyebrow. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sun was setting, casting a colorful evening glow over the bamboo courtyard, enveloping the three of them in a warm and gentle light, reminiscent of the playful moments they had shared on the deck of a ship at dusk.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, their time together was always short-lived. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before parting, James stood outside the door and turned to Zenith. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Through his face, which looked exactly like Zack's, he whispered softly in his heart, "Zack, I'm sorry I couldn't protect you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was the biggest regret of James's life, and in the years to come, he would always think of Zack. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Whenever he encountered a certain scene, he would wonder what it would be like if Zack were still here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carrying his regret, guilt, and longing for Zack, James left Barcelona with Amelia. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they walked out of the airport, they ran into Matty. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dylan was with him, and when he saw Amelia, he hesitated for a moment before his gaze softened. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, he didn't approach them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia noticed Dylan avoiding eye contact and furrowed her brows slightly, feeling sorry for him still being under Matty's control. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matty's appearance at the airport was not a coincidence; he had calculated James's arrival and brought Dylan here on purpose.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing the two of them, Matty took off his black English hat and said to Dylan, "Didn't you want to see your sister? Now that you've met her, go talk to her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He intentionally separated Dylan from Amelia, avoiding her on purpose. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James couldn't help but see through Matty's intentions, but he didn't expose him. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He just nodded at Amelia and indicated that she could talk to Dylan. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia followed Dylan to a corner, leaving James alone with Matty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matty approached James and said, "Shall we talk about the chip?"</span></p></div>
