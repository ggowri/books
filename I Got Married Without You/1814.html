        <h1>Chapter 1814 A good grandfather</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay, how about this: you come back with me to acknowledge the family, and as for whether you want to live with me in the future, you can decide slowly." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matty seemed to sense Amelia's concerns, so he took a step back and suggested that she first acknowledge the Lawrence family and experience their atmosphere. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And as for your sister's child, you can also bring them to the Lawrence family to acknowledge the family." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After hesitating for a moment, Amelia pushed away Matty's hand. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My sister's child belongs to the Johnson family and the Sherwood family. They are two generations apart from the Lawrence family. There's no need for them to acknowledge the family now. As for me..." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She paused, furrowed her brow, then relaxed her expression. "I can acknowledge the family, but I have my own home and won't live with you." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though she was currently at odds with James, she had her own family before </span><span>depending on James.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had her own home, and in the future, she would have her own children. She would live with her children and Grace, so there was no need for her to fully return to the Lawrence family. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matty understood Amelia's meaning and didn't continue to pressure her. For him, Amelia agreeing to acknowledge the family was a good start. "Then tomorrow, I'll have Dylan come to pick you up, and I'll take you back home together." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia didn't say much, just nodded. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matty then got up to leave, but before he left, he reminded Amelia to rest well. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia picked up the file folder on the table and asked Matty to take back the shares. Matty said that it was prepared by his son and grandson a long time ago and that she and Grace deserved it. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that file, besides her, there was also Grace. Matty was determined to make it up to them. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she watched his more stooped figure than when he arrived, Amelia felt that Matty was right about one thing. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said that if Sophia hadn't lied to him back then, he would have found </span><span>Sumasa</span><span> no matter where she was. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matty wasn't a good husband, but he was a good grandfather, and that's why Amelia nodded. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had informed Eva in advance that she was going to Canada for a while to acknowledge the family and would return immediately to avoid being disturbed by the Lawrence family. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva had heard that everything in Amelia's house was bought by the Lawrence family, leaving no space to even step on. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Eva was a little worried and wanted to go with her, but she was too far along in her pregnancy to be running around. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia said it would only be for a few days, and she would come back, not planning to stay in Canada for long, so Eva shouldn't worry. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By the time the two women had finished discussing, Paul had already arranged for the bodyguards to accompany Amelia to Canada. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva finally relaxed, and Amelia told Eva to take care of herself and said that when she returned, she would go get Grace. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing this, Eva quickly said, "Why not wait for James to come back before taking Grace away? At least you should inform him." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva thought that the two of them should have some kind of meeting or contact, and leaving Grace on Blue Bay Island without being taken away was the best way to do that. Amelia naturally understood the meaning behind Eva's words but didn't give a direct answer, only saying that they would talk about it when she got back and bid each other goodnight before hanging up. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next day, Dylan arrived on time, arranged a business car, and picked up Amelia and her bodyguards. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He considerately took the small box from Amelia's hand, then opened the car door and leaned against the top of the door, inviting Amelia to get in. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Amelia got into the car, Dylan drove them to the airport, where the Lawrence family had arranged a private plane, and they boarded when the time came. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After arriving in Canada, the Lawrence family's people came to pick them up, including Matty's two sons, all dressed in suits and standing straight. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing the row of unfamiliar people, Amelia felt a headache coming on, especially when Dylan informed her that there would be a family acknowledgment ceremony. Matty said that after finally finding his lost child, it was only natural to let everyone know, so he wanted to hold some kind of banquet. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In addition to the Lawrence family's relatives, he also invited other prominent families in Canada and even wanted to invite the media to announce her identity, but Amelia refused. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matty then removed the media but insisted on holding the banquet.</span></p></div>
