        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After she settled down, she lifted her head, assessing each operator in the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The control area was brightly lit, illuminating a man standing out in the crowd, his aura as cold as ice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even with masks on, they found each other across the sea of people.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their gazes met, and for a moment, they were the only ones in the world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia didn't know how James reacted to seeing her, she was just relieved to see him safe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James, who had been watching Amelia closely, felt a wave of relief wash over him at the sight of her alive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To him, the most beautiful thing in the world was her being alive. As long as she lived, he could endure anything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once everyone gathered, Matty began, "I'm retiring, so the woman next to me, is taking over. Her code name is Eagle."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">"Amelia's replacing Matty? Then we are... enemy,"</span><span> James was shocked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He surmised Amelia insisted on visiting him, causing this decision.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matty agreed not for his granddaughter's sake but to ensnare Amelia in Erebus, limiting his actions post-departure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Erebus' leader, Amelia would be a target of the S group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matty seemed to be using Amelia as a pawn without remorse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matty, smirking at James's response, announced, "Nick is dead. Zone A's 1-3 is now 1-2 and in charge of Erebus. 1-4 is promoted to 1-3, everyone else stays the same."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia was puzzled not to see Johnny, the 1-4 in the crowd, but she didn't press the matter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The operators in the control room were taken aback.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had expected Matty to promote Dylan to 1-1, yet the position had fallen to a woman they had never seen before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The operators were disgruntled, but after what happened to Nick, nobody dared to openly challenge Matty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Dylan's position was elevated, he was far from happy. He knew Matty did this to keep him in Erebus permanently, probably to prevent him from confiding in Amelia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matty, quick as always, dismissed the crowd and left just 2-9 behind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the last person left the room, he did something that shocked James - he removed his mask.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James had a hunch about who was behind it, but he didn't expect Matty to reveal his identity just like that. By doing so, it meant that James knew who Erebus was and Amelia would never need to tell him again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matty wasn't unmasking himself because he couldn't hide anymore, but because he'd calculated that James had figured him out. He also figured that James would use this to signal Amelia, so he cut off his retreat. A worthy leader of Erebus and a North American titan, James couldn't help but admire him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With his mask off, Matty looked at James and chuckled, "Bet you didn't see that coming, huh?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That insincere smile made James feel sick.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Undeterred by James's silence, Matty continued his pleasant facade.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lots of our operatives have seen my face, mostly the ones I trust. But for the newbies, like you, I've always stayed in the shadows," he said, hinting at Amelia's innocence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His intention was clear. He wanted Amelia to know that James had never met the founder of Erebus before, thus dispelling her doubts. That's why he'd taken the long way around just to shake off Amelia's guards and settle her concerns.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Evans," he continued, "she is your pregnant wife, my granddaughter. As for how we met, I'll let her explain. I won't intrude on your moment."</span></p></div>
