        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Matty wasn't the founder of Erebus, Amelia might've found his actions a bit touching.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But right now, she felt nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She just picked up her pace to keep up with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dylan was the one driving, with no one else in the car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia knew her hunch was right; none of the Lawrence Family knew about Erebus, except Dylan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia sarcastically praised Matty's acting skills, while he tried to paint a picture of how cruel 'S' was and how much Erebus had suffered under him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Amelia couldn't care less about his attempts to manipulate her. She just turned her head, looking out the window and memorizing their route.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The journey was long, involving a car ride, a helicopter, a ferry, and more helicopter rides.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a whole day and night, they finally arrived at an unknown mountain top.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia suspected Matty had intentionally taken a longer route to confuse her, but seeing how familiar they were with the way, she doubted it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Andrew was livid, hitting the steering wheel, "That sly old dog! Despite our chopper, he slipped us!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He did start Erebus. He's hard to pin down. Let's wait for Mrs. Evans' location update," Peter tried to soothe him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they waited, Amelia shadowed Matty and Dylan to a villa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matty casually pointed out the mountainside villas, defining the zones by compass directions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He explained to Amelia she needed to learn the Ace layout for the 1-1, briefing her on the zones, rules, and gameplay.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It dawned on Amelia that Erebus was concealed underground, the villas serving as entrances.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was stunned that such a secret place could </span><span>harbour</span><span> Erebus, and ordinary villas could house such malevolence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After the Ace rundown, they entered a Zone A villa, home to a respectful elderly couple.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia learned they were long-serving Lawrence Family servants, well-treated by Matty, who had generously gifted them assets and supported their children.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite admiring Matty's leadership skills, Amelia found his use of them for murderous purposes deeply disturbing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, Matty led her through the basement, twisting and turning like a maze, before finally stopping at a hefty metal door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A series of security checks - facial scan, iris recognition, palm verification, voice check - and the door finally swung open.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Getting inside Ace wasn't just about stepping through the door. An elevator ride and several corridors later, they reached Section A.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their destination was the upper area, specifically the control room - Matty's hub of operations.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A black-masked henchman brought a mask, black with a bluebird design.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matty explained the pattern was her grandmother's favorite, a constant reminder of his vow for vengeance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The continuous infusion of hate was unsettling for Amelia, but she had her reasons for being there, discomfort be damned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Matty helped her don the mask, he had Dylan summon the operators for a </span><span>meeting in the control room, planning to reveal her identity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia's real intention was to see James and deliver some information, but after Matty promised they would meet post-announcement, she didn't argue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Dylan began tapping on the console, a mechanical voice echoed across areas A, B, and C.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Operators in the middle of tasks quickly made their way to the control room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Amelia asked how many operators were there, Matty explained that each area had two groups of nine - all his partners, not counting the numerous henchmen in black.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once she had a rough idea of the layout and personnel, Amelia took advantage of the gathering in the control room to sneak a peek at her phone's signal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Realizing it wasn't blocked, she quickly made an excuse to go to the bathroom, hiding in a stall to send a quick message and location to Andrew.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matty, ever observant, knew something was up the moment Amelia excused herself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she left, he nodded subtly, and the henchman at the console started typing, intercepting the message.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Amelia, unaware, thought her message had been sent and returned to the control room, now filled with masked figures in black protective gear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she entered, the operators lifted their heads, their gazes intense even behind their masks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia steadied herself, ignored the burning stares, and took her seat next to Matty at his beckoning.</span></p></div>
