        <h1>Chapter 1201 Is Gloria really innocent?</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gloria seemed to also think of their shared memories, but that emotion quickly vanished in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't see him as a son, she spared his life only for revenge, torture, and venting her anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was always just a tool for her to erase her pain, and she would never let any motherly affection towards him arise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gloria built a high wall in her heart, but when she saw James's face, which resembled Nate's, she slowly lowered her proud head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Was she not wrong? Is she really not wrong?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No, she was wrong.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was her who, in order to get Nate, exposed Ashley's identity as a member of the Clark family through someone else's mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was her who first broke them up, and it was also her who subtly reminded Dominic that she was suitable to be the wife of the Evans family's head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was only after that, that Dominic went to the Leinster family to propose a business alliance. Otherwise, she would not have had the chance to marry the man she had long admired.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought that if Nate married her, he would forget about Ashley, but he drank heavily day and night, and even in his sleep, he called out Ashley's name.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After he was drugged on their wedding day and had sex with her once, he never touched her again. He even felt sorry for Ashley when he saw her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She couldn't stand her husband, who had other women in his heart and eyes. She argued with him like a lunatic every day, and in the end, he left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next time she heard from him was when Ashley was pregnant with his child. His explanation was that he forced Ashley, and it had nothing to do with her. This was undoubtedly the last straw. He wouldn't even touch her when she forced him, but he went all the way to another country to force someone else. How much did he hate her?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since then, Gloria has hated Nate. She swore that she would never let this pair of adulterers and their child have it easy in this lifetime.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She eventually succeeded, but the line between right and wrong suddenly became blurred...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She looked at James and the woman beside him, and the scale of goodness in her heart slowly tilted towards evil.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Regardless, James should not have gone against Simon's last wishes and turned to marry his beloved woman, so...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Let him forever bear the label of "illegitimate child" and live in agony!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After knowing that it was Gloria who started the fire, James no longer tangled with the issue of right and wrong, and only continued to ask, "Since you started the fire, why was Simon in the room?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking of Simon, Gloria's eyelashes slowly drooped, looking at her own legs that were broken by the wooden beams, "Who would have thought that he would not sleep in the middle of the night and run to the room to find his father..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If she hadn't learned from the butler that her son was in that bastard's room and stood far away clapping, how could she have rushed into the fire?</span></p></div>
