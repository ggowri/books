        <h1>Chapter 1817 Don't meddle in my affairs</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia's marriage to James was something that the Lawrence family's people would inevitably be able to find out, but they never mentioned James in front of her, including not asking about the child in her belly. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia thought that the Lawrence family didn't care who her husband was, only about her, so no one brought it up. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now that Matty had personally asked, she didn't avoid the question. After pausing for a few seconds, Amelia turned to face Matty. "He is important to me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matty and Amelia locked eyes across the small garden. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a long pause, he slowly spoke. "I've checked, James hasn't been good to you. He almost caused your death for another woman. With a man like that, is he really important to you?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That was a misunderstanding from the past. We are married now and have a child. Let's not dwell on the past." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their personal matters were not something outsiders had the right to comment on. Standing under the pear tree, bathed in the dim light of the streetlamp, her figure was somewhat blurry, but her determination was still evident. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can feel that you love him very much, but what about him?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a moment of contemplation, Amelia looked at Matty under the lamplight, her eyes reflecting his weathered and puzzled face. "In your view, is it that only your love is true love, and others' is not?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matty smiled faintly, walked across the cobblestone path, past a few small trees, and stood in front of Amelia. "Someone once said that my love is twisted, I admit, but now it's not about me, it's about your husband." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia raised her chin slightly, staring into Matty's resolute eyes. "Why do you think that you can interfere in my husband and my affairs just because I agreed to come back and acknowledge my family?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I have no right to interfere, but Amelia, I just want to understand you more, to care for you, without any ill intentions." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His expression truly showed no malice. However, Amelia clearly felt that Matty did not want her to be with James.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dylan previously came to the Evans family to discuss a marriage alliance, which shows that the Lawrence family does not reject the Evans family." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he didn't know James' true identity, Matty would naturally be satisfied with James. However, now they were essentially in a hostile relationship, each standing for their own members. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, even if he was willing to let James go for Amelia's sake, Erebus's other partners would not agree. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And James himself might not necessarily let go of past grievances, especially considering the many members of S that Erebus had killed. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matty was a comprehensive thinker, so his decisions would be resolute, including when facing Amelia. "I just said that I have checked your situation, and I cannot forgive him on your behalf."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia didn't show much emotion, and didn't say anything. "I just came back to acknowledge my family, don't meddle in my affairs." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Amelia didn't wait for Matty's response, she turned and walked back into the house. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The back door slammed shut, cutting off Matty and the cold wind. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After standing there in a daze for a moment, the old butler came over with a blanket, draped it over him, and helped him back inside. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That night, Amelia took her phone, found a storybook, and touched her belly, telling her child a story before falling asleep. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matty, on the other hand, stayed up all night, looking at Sophia's photo under the desk lamp, quietly contemplating the importance of what Amelia had said. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next day, Matty waited for Amelia to wake up naturally, then instructed the butler to prepare a nutritious breakfast and bring a thick coat for her. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your two uncles and two brothers are waiting outside for you. Let's go." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yesterday, when she arrived at the airport, Amelia had already met Matty's two sons, who were quite handsome and had a resemblance to </span><span>Sumasa</span><span> in their features. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were not as enthusiastic as Matty, nor as curious as the three brothers of the Lawrence family, but they welcomed Amelia as an elder, and occasionally asked her how she was doing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In fact, Amelia preferred the way she interacted with the two uncles. They didn't force themselves on her and genuinely cared for her in small ways, which was quite heartwarming. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They sat in the business-class seats, which were spacious, and the two uncles made her sit in the back seat, even fastening her seatbelt for her, and prepared snacks like hawthorn and preserved plums, in case she felt carsick.</span></p></div>
