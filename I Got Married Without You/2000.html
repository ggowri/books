        <h1>Chapter 2000 Destined to Die</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In consideration of Alexander's feelings, Amelia refrained from taking her own life. However, overnight, her hair turned grey, as if she had aged a decade in an instant. Her smooth face was now etched with deep wrinkles, and her vibrant eyes had become hollow and vacant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As a mother, Amelia acknowledged that she could no longer act as freely as before. Therefore, she asked James to wait for her by his grave and stated her intention to take her own life after Alexander's marriage. Moreover, she warned James that if he didn't honor his commitment, she would retract her promise to be with him and vowed never to reunite with him in their next lives.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She did not attend James' funeral. Later, she suddenly woke up and staggered to his grave. No one remembered her words except Alexander, who helped her to see James.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That night, Amelia collapsed in the snow and lost consciousness. After being sent to the hospital for emergency treatment, she was in a coma for seven days and seven nights.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Due to her absence, James' body remained in an ice coffin for a week without being buried. However, upon awakening, she only cast a fleeting glance at him before hurriedly turning away, her eyes vacant and her hair grey.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for how they entombed James and arranged the cemetery and which photo they chose as his portrait, Amelia did not participate in any of it. She just sat on the head of the bed, touching the cold pillow beside her and imagining the scene of him still alive...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought, "If you were still alive, would you feel heartbroken and tearful at the sight of my grey hair?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Probably yes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James, your jealousy and insecurity are palpable. Every time I am worried about you, you will be delighted for a long time and convinced that I love you very much. However, you will never see how depressed and sleepless I am because of you. You must be regretful, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia received no response, resembling an elderly woman speaking to herself as she touched the cold pillow, often lingering there throughout the night. No one could have anticipated that this skinny woman was once an astonishing beauty who had captivated James' heart for a lifetime.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander took James' ashes back from the crematorium and buried them in the cemetery of the Evans family. He selected a wonderful place with trees and flowers. When the sun was shining brightly, it would illuminate the entire grave. It was just like James, who had been bathed in the sun, his whole body covered with a layer of golden light, and he appeared dazzling and brilliant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After taking care of James' funeral, Alexander returned to the villa in the snowy mountains alone. He opened the door and came to the dining table.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The food there was arranged as neatly as ever. Nothing had changed except the fact that the dish, fresh ten days before, had gone bad.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander stared at it for a long time before pulling out the chair and sitting down. Then, he picked up the knife and fork and cut the steak that he had been unable to chew at the time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Somehow, this time, he exerted significantly more force and managed to split it open in just two attempts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He indifferently forked up the steak and put it into his mouth. The taste of the meat had altered, yet he was unable to discern it. As he was chewing, tears suddenly streamed down his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was the first and final occasion on which James had cooked dinner for Alexander, serving as his best birthday gift and the last present from James in his life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From now on, Alexander lost his father.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Two months later, he walked out of the medical laboratory. Without even changing his sterile gowns, he drove back to Blue Bay Island and opened the door of the master bedroom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander walked up to Amelia and held her hand tightly, looking at her, who had aged overnight. Tears gradually welled up in his eyes. "My operation was successful."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His operation was really achieved, but James had passed away. Alexander believed he would definitely be able to save James if he could hold on a little longer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing the news, Amelia turned her hollow eyes slowly on him, raised her trembling fingers, and stroked his cheeks. "Well done."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead of blaming him for being late, she praised him. Alexander grew extremely guilty and glanced down. "I'm sorry. If I had been earlier, Father wouldn't have left us."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After caressing Alexander's face, Amelia lifted the quilt, got out of bed, and walked to the bookshelf. She opened the cabinet from which the safe was retrieved. With the password entered, she took out a report and handed it to Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander perused the report, only to discover that James couldn't endure the wait any longer, not due to a lack of strength, but because his brain tumor had recurred. This marked the second relapse, and it had developed into brain cancer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if Alexander's surgical calculations were successful, James wouldn't be able to endure three craniotomies. Hence, whether the chip could be removed or not was inconsequential. What truly mattered was that undergoing the surgery would inevitably result in death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It turned out that James was destined to die, which was why he told Alexander to do his best.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James, who was rather reluctant to part with Amelia, had persevered for eighteen years. How could he falter now, with just two months to go? The demise must be inevitable, so he gave up all his hopes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander held the report in his hand. The regret he had been unable to let go of for so long turned to sorrow at that moment. He actually embraced Amelia and buried his head in her neck, absorbing the warmth from her.&#8203;</span></p></div>
