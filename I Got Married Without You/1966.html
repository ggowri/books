        <h1>Chapter 1966 Do You Still Regret It</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, with her eyes lowered, she looked at the face that had become so worn it barely seemed alive. Suddenly, her tears streamed down like rain, splashing crazily onto Anthony's face yet failing to stir the slightest ripple.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He died. He died amid Edith's harsh words that she could never forgive him, died under the cold rejections Edith had hardened her heart to deliver time and again, died from the agony of Edith falling for someone else, and died with the regret of never having married Edith.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Overwhelmed by grief, Edith could no longer move. The police pushed her aside, covered the body with a white sheet, and loaded it into the van. The moment the door closed, she collapsed, hugging her chilling body, watching the van disappear from her sight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just like Anthony, he forever disappeared from her view, silently departing, leaving behind a love that swept through her memories like a virus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had said, after the trial, there would be no more ties between them. It turned out he hadn't planned to let her go. He simply ran out of time...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The day he went to court, the smell of blood she sensed was not from a corroded bathroom but from the blood Anthony vomited.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His thinning silhouette wasn't due to overwork. It was stomach cancer, unable to eat, that had emaciated him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he kissed her and then cried, it wasn't in regret that she didn't forgive him or didn't accept him, but because he couldn't bear to leave her...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And after that kiss, when he hid outside, waiting for her to come out, it wasn't to create a chance encounter. He just wanted to spend more time with her before his life faded...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Edith spent her life searching for pure love, never realizing it was right behind her. Anthony, pure-hearted and unwavering, had been waiting for her all along with his most profound love.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even as he reached the end of his life, he used his last breath to send: [I love you], but he departed too soon to hear her response...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Edith, covering her face like a child abandoned. She squatted down and cried for a long time before recklessly following the van heading to the crematorium...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony's family would never sign off on an unwanted child, so Anthony's body was temporarily stored in the morgue's freezer. By the time Edith arrived, his body was already stiff from the cold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She slid open the freezer door and collapsed in tears upon seeing Anthony lying there without a single piece of clothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her warm fingers carefully traced his cheeks, touching him as if he were a precious relic, cautiously feeling every inch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The icy touch of his skin and the stiffness beneath her fingertips painfully reminded Edith that the man who once loved her so deeply was truly gone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bowing her head, Edith hugged his body, pressing her tear-streaked face against his chest. "Anthony, wake up, can we start over?" she pleaded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The heart beneath that chest longed for an answer, but it would no longer flutter with excitement...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the world Anthony lived, he spent his lifetime waiting for her, never even getting a final goodbye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He did leave with regrets.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He left this world quietly, burdened with regrets and pain, yet in leaving, he shed those burdens, no longer tormented by emotions or illness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For Anthony, posthumously, it was no regrets.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was gone, leaving only Edith with her regrets...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She lay on him, crying for a long time as if her tears could bring Anthony back. Finally, she was forcibly led away by the comforting staff at the crematorium...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't leave but sat on the cold floor outside the crematorium, hugging her knees, staring into the night...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her mind filled with memories of how Anthony had doted on her, especially recalling the time he was stabbed several times trying to save her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony must have thought she had forgotten, but she remembered it all. It was because she remembered that she loved him fiercely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, she wanted to love Anthony like before, but he was truly gone. All she could do was feel the breeze on her cheek and whisper, "Anthony, if your spirit is still here, become the wind and gently brush my cheek, will you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Obediently, the wind caressed her face, making her feel as if Anthony was still with her, just in a different form, silently watching over her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Edith wiped the tears from her cheeks, then smiled and said, "Anthony, could you come back to life, just once more, into your body?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, the stillness of the air signified that he would never return. Realizing this, Edith cried uncontrollably again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She deeply regretted not visiting him that night. She believed that if she had, Anthony might have lived a little longer and might have heard her plea to start anew.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she was hard-hearted. She walked away without ever looking back, repeatedly rejecting Anthony's attempts to get close. She couldn't tell if she was just cold-hearted or if she feared falling for him again. Either way, she was ruthless.</span></p></div>
