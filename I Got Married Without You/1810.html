        <h1>Chapter 1810 The last message from Zack</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, these words, when said, seemed to lack much persuasiveness and instead seemed to constrain others. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But later, Gigi, relying on this sentence, found her way back to Zack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Amelia was not sure if the Gigi who later had a happy family and children had forgotten about Zack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that time, when Amelia went to pay her respects at Zack's grave, she also encountered Gigi, who had come to the grave. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They passed by each other at that time. They had not seen each other for many years, both wearing black berets, carrying flower baskets, and leading children, walking with their heads down, each going their own way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia walked to Zack's tombstone and saw fresh chrysanthemums. She turned her head and looked for Gigi's figure among the thousands of graves. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The figure, younger than her, seemed to have hurriedly come and then disappeared into the dense forest of graves, never looking back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every year on the anniversary, no matter how early Amelia arrived, there would always be a bouquet of flowers placed in front of Zack's grave. She thought that Gigi must have never forgotten him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But these were all stories from later. At the moment, Amelia only knew that the Gigi of the present had attempted suicide several times and was living a life worse than death. Everyone said Gigi had gone mad, and she had indeed gone mad for a while. However, the departure of the child seemed to awaken her from the fog. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She knew that it was because of her lack of cherishing that the child had left her forever.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She held Amelia and said many things, all blaming herself. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blaming herself for always hitting and scolding Zack when they were together, for not being gentle with him. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blaming herself for always acting like a princess in front of Zack, ordering him around without loving him properly. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blaming herself for not protecting even the last bloodline left by Zack, she was a very bad, very selfish person. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because she had only cared about her own feelings from beginning to end.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After listening to these words, Amelia also cried all night. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She understood too well what kind of emotional breakdown it was to lose a loved one. She had once thought that if James had passed away, she would be even more devastated than Gigi.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She held Gigi, patted her back, comforted her, and didn't sleep until she had fallen asleep. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next day, Gigi's phone rang, and upon hearing the sound, she suddenly woke up. She got up from Amelia's arms, like a madwoman, didn't even put on her shoes, and went to the bedside table to find her phone. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After finding her phone, she trembled as she opened the social media platform and checked the latest messages. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Zack's new account, which she had forced Zack to open and only allowed him to contact her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She saw the last message from Zack:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[Gigi, </span><span>This</span><span> message is scheduled to be sent. If I haven't returned by now, I am most likely already dead. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I am very sorry. I promised to marry you, to spend the rest of my life with you, but I didn't fulfill any of it. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I am not a qualified boyfriend. Blame me, resent me, it doesn't matter. Just don't be sad, and don't blame Mr. Evans. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He is the person I am willing to sacrifice my life for. When I was a child and stole food, I was chased by wild dogs and beaten by people. It was Mr. Evans who saved me. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He has done a lot for me, and many times, he has helped me out. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I think this time, it should be my turn to repay him. So, Gigi, don't blame him, okay? Also, I love you very much. Even if I leave, I will always love you in another world. You are the first person I liked, and also my first woman. You are unique in my heart. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I don't want you to be depressed because of my departure. I want you to be my proudest princess forever.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, princess, go to the church we agreed to go to and pray for me for a year, okay? </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If you haven't forgotten me after a year, then I will definitely come to see you in another form. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Love you. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Your Zack]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After reading this letter, Gigi cried uncontrollably. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had not expected that Zack had already foreseen his own death. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had made preparations, yet he had left her behind. But since he had decided to die, why did he want to be with her?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gigi held her phone and cried, "It was me who insisted on being with him." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Could she blame Zack? No. It was her who had forced it. Her relationship with Zack was something she had forced.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia hugged the crying Gigi from the side. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She couldn't say anything, only endless tears to comfort her.</span></p></div>
