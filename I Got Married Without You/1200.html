        <h1>Chapter 1200 Longing for that tiny bit of maternal love</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia looked at James in surprise again. If James&rsquo; father had an affair with her mother after marriage, wouldn't James be burdened with the label of "illegitimate child"?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James didn't want to reveal his embarrassing background in front of Amelia, but he understood the cause and effect of everything. He couldn't escape from it no matter what. However... it was caused by the previous generation, yet he had to bear the consequences.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had suffered from beatings since childhood, and everything he cared about had been destroyed. Did this mean that he had already paid off the debt left by his parents? Then... who would give him justice?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gloria saw that he was silent and knew that he was in guilty. That was enough. "Your father had an affair after marriage. Do you think he deserves to die?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She admitted it openly, which made James look at her with a little more respect. "When he asked for a divorce, you didn't agree, so you set fire to kill him?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gloria sneered, "Do you think I wanted him dead from the beginning? It was him who gradually chilled my heart, and that's why I wanted to burn him alive."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After speaking, she sighed softly again, "There is no way. This world will not punish men who cheat and their mistresses. I can only take action myself, destroy Nate's woman, humiliate his son, and finally kill him. I just did a just thing. Do you think I'm wrong?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Compared with the previous hatred, James was calm towards Gloria at this moment. "It's Dominic's fault. He broke up my parents and also </span><span>caused you harm</span><span>."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For the first time ever, James spoke to her in such a calm tone, which made Gloria pause. The words "</span><span>caused you harm</span><span>" gradually eased the resentment in her heart. "If you were like this when you were a child, maybe I would have been a bit more merciful."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked at the woman in the wheelchair who had caused him endless harm and said expressionlessly, "I tried to please you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he was six years old, in order to gain a little bit of maternal love, he followed his brother's example and bought her favorite cake on her birthday. He ran into her room excitedly, shouting, "Mom, I bought your favorite cake. I wish you good health, happiness, and joy forever..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Gloria not only did not receive it gently like she did with his brother, but also kicked him away and crushed the cake he bought with her high heels, while cursing, "A mongrel bought me something, even if it's for feeding dogs, I won't eat it..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Until yesterday, James didn't understand why Gloria was so cruel to him. Now that he knew the truth, he felt relieved...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They are not really mother and son, so how could he expect even a little bit of maternal love from her?</span></p></div>
