        <h1>Chapter 1673 Happy wedding</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia couldn't help but laugh when she remembered Eva's speechless expression after being teased by the two robots. "Honey, why can't the robots developed by your company be a little more attractive?" she asked. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Amelia spoke, Robot Number 77 was bowing and nodding to James. "Welcome, welcome, welcome..." it began, but James interrupted and shut it off. The robot's mouth was wide open, revealing a jumble of messy wires.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon seeing this, James's expression turned serious. "Paul didn't even bother to properly construct the basic structure because he was in a rush. Yet, he still had the audacity to put the Evans' Group label on it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia thought it was ugly on the outside, while James believed the internal structure wasn't well-made. They didn't see eye to eye on this, so Amelia didn't say anything. Instead, she just took his arm and said, "Well then, honey, you should make another version of yourself."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James looked back at Amelia and asked, "Why?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia stood on her tiptoes and playfully poked his cheek. "Because I also want a husband who bends over and welcomes me every day..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James chuckled affectionately, "If I were to make one, I would make it so that even you wouldn't recognize me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia didn't think he could actually do it, so she casually replied, "Okay."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, the emcee took the stage and announced that the sea wedding was about to begin. The guests were instructed to take their seats and wait for the bride and groom to make their entrance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After telling James that she was going to find Eva, Amelia turned and headed towards the dressing room. Eva was sitting in front of the mirror, continuously taking deep breaths in an attempt to calm her nerves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon seeing Amelia enter, she couldn't help but say, "I've been married once before, so I should be used to this, but why am I still so nervous?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia was amused by Eva's comment and walked over, taking her hand. "Eva, you're nervous because you're marrying the person you love the most, and you're doing it in front of his family, walking down the aisle, exchanging rings, and making vows to each other."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva found her words reasonable, but she still couldn't control her nervousness. "Do you think I'll trip on my wedding dress and fall on stage later?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia comforted her, "No, even if you do fall, Paul will be there to catch you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva furrowed her brow, "You think so?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Indeed, Paul didn't catch her. Instead, they both fell down together. It was a struggle for them to help each other back up. When Paul pulled his hand back from Eva's waist, it accidentally caught onto her veil. Unaware of it, he proceeded to cover Eva's face with the veil, only to have it abruptly pulled off...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing this scene, the guests were momentarily stunned, but then burst into laughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The wedding had a few hiccups in the beginning, but overall, it went smoothly. It was like the journey Eva and Paul had taken together, filled with twists and turns, but with a good outcome.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The media couldn't enter the wedding venue, but they had taken some footage of the ship before the ceremony. It had already made headlines, and people online were discussing it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The initial public opinion was that as long as someone is attractive enough, even an orphan can marry into a wealthy family. Then, someone revealed that Eva had been divorced before, leading the public opinion to shift to the idea that as long as someone is scheming enough, even a divorced person can marry into a wealthy family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The public opinion wasn't favorable, but Paul seemed prepared. When everyone was attacking and insulting Eva on Twitter, he posted a timed message: "[We've been together for three years. I proposed to her and spent two years trying to make her marry me. Now, I finally succeeded. Next, I will spend a lifetime trying to convince her to spend the rest of her life with me.]"</span></p></div>
