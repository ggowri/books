        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He cut Amelia's car off and stops it, pushing the door open again and walking over to knock on her window, "Open the door!" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia had no choice but to lower her window and look out the window at Johnny, "Mr. Brook, what can I do for you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Johnny angled his chin at her, "Gigi doesn't believe Zack is dead and is clamoring to get to Zack, in order to kill her I'm going to make a trip to Erebus, it just so happens that you're going as well, so let's come along." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia stiffened, as if she hadn't realized that Johnny had sensed that she was going to Erebus and was planning to go with her. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After she recovered from her astonishment, she looked at Johnny: "Zack and their so good hands didn't escape, you're frail and sick to run there, I'm afraid you ......" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Johnny coldly interrupted her: "I'm frail and sick, how good can you be?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia hesitated for a moment before still shaking her head, "Miss Brook has already lost her fianc&eacute;, if she loses her loving brother again, she would definitely go crazy."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Johnny put away his rambling and asked her rhetorically, "You don't think she's crazy right now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gigi's irritation affected her nerves, saying one minute that Zack was dead and the next that he wasn&rsquo;t, and she wouldn&rsquo;t accept the reality until he took a trip there himself and came back to tell her that Zack was really dead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia lowered her eyes and fell into indecision, Johnny stared at her, fell silent, and then spoke meaningfully, "As her brother, it's only right to do something for her." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia said in a deep voice: "Zack followed my husband to Erebus, all that came back was broken bones, you followed me to Erebus, I'm afraid that even the bones can't come back, how should I explain to Miss Brook then?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Johnny didn't care: "She won't know, I made a thorough plan and arranged hundreds of people to follow us quietly, when we wait for the specific place, my people would destroy the place immediately." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia frowned: "A plan that even you can think of, my husband can definitely think of it as well, and they must have made deployments in this regard as well, but not only did they not destroy Erebus, they still couldn't get out of there, which means that Erebus is very powerful ......"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Johnny naturally knew that Erebus was powerful, but so what: "It's better than doing nothing and going straight to death, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was something Amelia couldn't argue with, but she still didn't agree, and Johnny didn't care whether she agreed or not, and went around the front of the car, pulling the passenger handle, and Amelia stared at him for a long time before pressing the unlock button.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Johnny sat in, while fastening the seat belt and said: "I bear the humiliation to find Holden to find out, Erebus side is a casino, to go there, either rich, or gamblers, they bet, is the two choices, choose the right, go through the door of life, choose the wrong, into the door of death, all the electronic equipment to control the life and </span><span>death, choose the wrong person, a can not escape. "</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Johnny fastened his seat belt, facing the dim light, looked at Amelia who was stunned: "On Paul's wedding boat, we also played the game of two choices, only you and I won, remember?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia was a bit bemused, "You and I just got lucky, and we played a game that doesn't kill people."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Erebus side of the house was obviously a place where torturing people for fun, was it comparable to the tricks played by a couple of rich dudes fighting amongst themselves?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Johnny, however, hooked his lips and smiled disdainfully, "Who knows if we'll keep getting lucky?"</span></p></div>
