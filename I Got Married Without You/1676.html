        <h1>Chapter 1676 That thorn was removed</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva took out her phone, intending to tell Amelia that she had returned to her home country, when she heard a car outside the door. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She followed the sound and saw Paul opening the passenger door and pulling Elsie out. Seeing Paul bringing Elsie home, Eva's heart sank. It seemed that the sweetness of the morning had vanished in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She felt her heart bleeding, but didn't know what to do. She could only sit there, staring blankly at the two of them entering. After Paul brought Elsie in, he let go of her hand and pushed her in front of Eva. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva, somewhat puzzled, lifted her chin and looked at Paul, who had a cold expression on his face. When he met her gaze, he gave her a reassuring look, then turned his attention back to Elsie with a cold stare. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Pin her down on the table!" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The bodyguards who entered behind him immediately stepped forward. One on each side, they grabbed Elsie's shoulders and pressed her onto the glass table. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After restraining her, Paul finally squatted down in front of Elsie. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tell me, in front of my wife, did I sleep with you?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva thought that once they agreed to get married, it meant the end of this matter. But she didn't expect that with Paul, not knowing the truth meant it would never be over. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He gave her a reassuring look when his gaze met hers, and then withdrew his eyes, coldly staring at Elsie. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Before the police arrive, you better tell the truth. I might consider letting you off the hook." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing that he really called the police, Elsie, feeling a bit guilty, naturally became fearful. However, she quickly calmed down. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aren't you afraid that I'll accuse you of forcing me?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul sneered. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No matter how you try to accuse and defend yourself, I will fight this lawsuit against you until the end. Get ready to go to jail!" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul had never used such strong tactics before. This was the first time, and Elsie suddenly became afraid. She could accuse Paul of rape, but it was all a lie. Besides, how could she compete with the powerful Evans family? </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elsie raised her eyes and looked up at Paul, who was towering above her. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This man had always been the one she wanted to hold onto, but she could never catch </span><span>him. Now they had become enemies. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Paul, did you ever love me when we were dating?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul, who had long forgotten their young memories, stared at Elsie and spoke coldly. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I was young and foolish. I thought you liked me, so I liked you too. But as for love..." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul's expressionless face uttered a single word - "Never." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elsie suddenly laughed. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No wonder your family disapproved. You just gave up on me directly." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The reason I gave up on you was because while we were dating, you intentionally flirted with James. We both know this, yet you shamelessly blame my parents." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul's resolute words reached Eva, who was sitting on the sofa, and she was slightly taken aback. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the recording, Elsie claimed that Kate had forced her, but she never expected that there was another hidden story behind it. Eva used to think that Elsie was just playing a few tricks because she liked Paul, but she didn't expect that she had already been acting improperly at a young age. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Being completely exposed in front of Eva, Elsie no longer cared about these things. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They became a couple, and no matter how much Elsie resented it, it was useless. She could only grit her teeth and bear it. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Since you never loved me when we were young, let that thorn forever separate us." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elsie, who had given up hope on Paul, took on an indifferent attitude. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul wanted to strangle her. But before he could do anything, Eva spoke first. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elsie, that thorn was removed from my perception of you when I realized that you were filled with lies." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this voice, Elsie thought Eva was being hypocritical. She ignored Eva and looked at Paul, who only had eyes for his wife. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Have you forgotten that I saved your life in Africa?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bringing up that incident made Paul furious. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I only found out today that the danger I encountered back then was instigated by you!" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elsie had only set a trap to get close to him, and if it weren't for a friend telling him the truth, he would still be in the dark.</span></p></div>
