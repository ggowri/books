        <h1>Chapter 1597 Congratulations</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing that smiling face, James suddenly had the urge to smack him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James frowned and thought for a moment, figuring out the source...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Andrew got married later than him, yet Andrew&rsquo;s wife got pregnant first...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He picked up the pen in his hand again and said coldly, "I won't approve your leave."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Andrew's smile immediately froze on his face, "Why?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His wife was pregnant and his boss won't approve his leave, that's too harsh!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James ignored him and continued signing, while Andrew anxiously pleaded, "Mr. Evans, just let me take a leave, even if it's just for a day..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing that his boss still didn't pay attention to him, Andrew immediately let go of the table and turned to walk towards the sofa. "If you don't agree, then I'll sit here and protest silently..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James: ...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After giving Andrew a sidelong glance, he opened the drawer and took out a bank card, throwing it directly at Andrew. "Congratulations."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Andrew was stunned for a moment upon seeing the bank card, then he waved his hand. "Your blessings are enough, I don't need the money..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James put down the pen again, extending his slender fingers to take back the card. "Since you don't want it, then I'll save it for Zack's child."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing this, Andrew immediately snatched the bank card back from James. "Then you should give it to me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a thick-skinned smile, Andrew took back the bank card. "Well then, Mr. Evans, I'll go pick up my wife..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without even lifting his head, James nodded slightly. It was only after Andrew left the office that he raised his eyes, sparkling like stars, and smiled at Andrew's receding figure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was probably the first person around him to become a father, and he naturally felt happy for Andrew. He just wondered when his own child would come...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James originally didn't want children, but seeing Andrew's joy made him slightly look forward to it. However, the moment he thought about the pain Amelia would have to endure, that anticipation instantly vanished. It's better not to have children, so his wife could suffer less.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stella quickly arrived at Imperial Capital and returned to the Simpson family. Karen was sitting on the sofa, scolding the servant severely. When she saw Stella coming in, Karen immediately shut up, quickly helped the servant up, and told her not to cry. After instructing her to get back to work, Karen stood up and smiled at Stella.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She linked arms with Stella and led her towards the living room, explaining what had just happened. "She ruined my dress with the iron. She got scared and kneeled in front of me apologizing. I told her it's okay, but she was afraid she couldn't afford to compensate for the dress, so she kept crying. I scolded her on purpose, but I didn't expect you to come back so soon..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Karen gently finished speaking, she waved her hand towards the teary-eyed girl. "Didn't you see that Stella is back? Stop crying and go back to the kitchen to cook. Remember to prepare more of what she likes to eat..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The girl looked helpless, glanced at Stella, but didn't dare say anything. She obediently nodded and turned to walk towards the kitchen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the past, Stella wouldn't have been able to see through this, but now she could see the sadness in the girl's eyes. It was probably because she knew that Karen's cousin had paid money to those thugs. Only then could she see that her aunt had two faces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She also thought about how Erin had scolded Karen many times for being fake, but because Karen was her aunt, she had never doubted what Karen said or the explanations she gave. If she had thought about it more at the time, would she have been able to discover the different side of her aunt...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking of this, Stella calmly pushed away Karen's hand, and without wasting any time, she sat down on the sofa. Then, she directly stated her purpose, "Aunt, I came here to talk about an old matter."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Karen, who was about to sit down on the sofa, stiffened for a moment upon hearing this, but she sat down without showing any signs of it. Then, she smiled and asked, "What old matter?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stella took out a stack of documents from her bag and placed them on the glass coffee table. "Why did your cousin Bart give money to those thugs after they were released from prison back then?"</span></p></div>
