        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eugene was at a loss for how to respond to this statement, but Matty didn't seem to care. "What I did to her wasn't exactly honorable, and it was even a bit cruel. I'd rather have her hate me than forgive me," he said.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eugene furrowed his brow. His grandfather had always been the best to him, praising </span><span>his good looks and comparing him to international superstars.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eugene had become a celebrity because of his grandfather's support.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, with his grandfather wanting to commit suicide, how could he accept it? Matty seemed to understand his thoughts and smiled at him. "Eugene, when we were kids, I liked you the most. I know you won't want me to leave, but everyone has to face this at some point in life. Why fear separation?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matty blew a smoke ring, the smoke swirling around his weathered face, giving him an air of nonchalance and detachment from worldly desires.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In his youth, Matty had clung to a belief in revenge for many years.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now that he had settled his scores, he no longer had a reason to live.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eugene couldn't bear to lose such a grandfather. He turned away, refusing to look at him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Owen did the same, hanging his head low, trying to process his emotions.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only Dylan seemed to have accepted the fact that his grandfather was leaving, calmly staring at him without saying a word.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matty's gaze shifted from Eugene to Dylan's calm face. "Besides owing Amelia, I owe you as well," he said.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matty gestured with the hand holding the cigarette, pointing to the ground. "Back then, you were this tall, and I took you away from your father," he said.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He smiled apologetically. "Your childhood, adolescence, and adulthood were different from your two brothers'. By the time I realized it, it was too late."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He sighed deeply, his eyes filled with regret and contentment. "Fortunately, you grew up in this environment and still maintained the kindness you should have. Otherwise, I wouldn't have the face to meet your grandmother."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dylan didn't seem to care about it. "Grandfather, you raised me and took good care of me. Sometimes you were strict, but it was all for my own good. You even treated my injuries while I was asleep," he said.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matty, with a raised eyebrow, asked, "You knew it?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dylan nodded. "Yes, I knew. That's why I willingly let you do it."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matty smiled in relief, shifting his gaze to his two sons sitting on the couch. "You two are getting older. In the future, go on trips with your wives and don't interfere in your children's marriage matters."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He specifically mentioned Dylan's father. "Pay more attention to Dylan. Find some time to have a heart-to-heart talk with him and see if he has any girls he likes. If he does, as his father, take care of the marriage arrangements and don't let anyone hinder his path behind his back."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matty's implication was that Dylan had liked someone before, but they missed their chance.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Dylan meets someone he likes in the future, as his father, he should strive for his son's happiness.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>River didn't understand these things and didn't catch on, but he nodded in agreement.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matty hadn't raised his two sons because they weren't particularly outstanding or intelligent. That's why he focused on his grandsons.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, his two sons, although not as talented, were kind-hearted and capable of being </span><span>directors in the company.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matty finished his instructions and let them go their separate ways.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bruce and River, being his biological sons, couldn't bear to let him die.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They refused to leave and stayed with him for his last night. The two sons laid out a mat and slept beside Matty.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They spent the night asking him if there was anything else he wanted to do.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matty said the thing he wanted to do most was to see Sophia. The two sons fell silent.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In their memories, their father often mentioned Sophia, always taking out her photo and staring at it, sometimes even crying.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In truth, Matty had never lived for himself. His whole life had been for Sophia.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it weren't for his obsession with revenge, Matty would have left this world long ago.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That obsession allowed Bruce and River to have a father and experience his love. Owen, Eugene, and Dylan also stayed downstairs in the living room, sitting for the whole night, waiting for the painful moment of separation.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was the most agonizing time, yet time passed quickly. Before they knew it, morning had arrived.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matty took a shower, cleaned himself up, shaved, and had his two sons help him cut his hair.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span> After they finished, he changed into a white shirt, put on a black vest, and wore a black top hat.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leaning on his cane, he made his way to Sophia's grave.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just like every time he came to pay his respects to Sophia, he touched her image on the tombstone and stared at it for a long time, saying many words.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, however, it wasn't a farewell to leave, but rather to take out a vial of medicine.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matty looked at Sophia's image and smiled with a sense of relief.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without any hesitation, he pushed the medicine onto his arm.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sophia, I&rsquo;ll come to see you. I hope you're still in heaven."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sophia, being such a kind person, could go to heaven.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Matty, with hands stained with blood, couldn't.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their lives were destined to never meet again.</span></p></div>
