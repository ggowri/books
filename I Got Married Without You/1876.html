        <h1>Chapter 1876 You must commit suicide</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matty's sudden raised voice, filled with endless resentment, seemed to want to crush Master Davies immediately. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James, with his calm and cold voice, casually revealed Master Davies' location. "He may be in London or Washington." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These two places were where Master Davies often went, as for whether he was there now, it was not James' concern. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After informing, James moved his sharp and proud gaze away from Matty and directed it through the bulletproof glass towards Amelia. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Release her." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matty, who had obtained the location of his enemy, followed James' gaze and glanced at Amelia. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The murderous intent that filled his eyes gradually subsided when it touched the face that resembled Sophia's.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He lowered his eyelashes and stared at the control panel. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a gentle press of the </span><span>open door</span><span> button, Amelia and James could leave this place. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He actually wanted Amelia to stay by his side, to accompany him through the last journey of his life. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, knowing the cause of Sophia's death was because of himself, it seemed meaningless. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His hands were stained with blood, yet he never felt guilty, except when it came to Sophia, who could easily break through his psychological defenses. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hatred supported him, enduring decades of torment. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now that this grudge had fallen on him, it should come to an end. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was just a bit regretful that he had gone through so much trouble to trap Amelia, claiming it was to make up for her, but only ended up hurting her. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The harm he caused to Amelia had already been done and couldn't be undone, but he could still minimize it in time. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Having come to this realization, Matty withdrew his gaze, raised his finger, and pressed it against the control panel. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Boss." Just as his fingertip was about to touch the </span><span>open door</span><span> button, a gun was pressed against the back of Matty's head. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What about our enemies, now that you've found yours and want to let them go?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing the voice, Matty slightly turned his gaze and looked at 2-5, who was responsible for guarding the biohazard area. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Their enemies have nothing to do with my granddaughter." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It may have nothing to do with your granddaughter, but we need to use her." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matty's eyes turned cold. "What? Are you going against my orders and choosing to </span><span>oppose me?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>2-5, holding the gun, sneered coldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What do you think we, your partners, are for? Are we just tools for your revenge?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Matty, ever since you ordered Dylan to kill Nick, we no longer intend to be your tools!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After 2-5 finished speaking, he ignored Matty and his gaze crossed over Matty's white hair, scanning the man opposite him. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shall we discuss a condition?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James, with his indifferent gaze, stared at the other person without saying a word, appearing like a contemptuous king.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can release your wife, but you must pay a price." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James raised his defiant eyes and coldly stared at the other person. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What price?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You must commit suicide as an apology."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing these words, Amelia, trapped in the escape room, felt her heart skip a beat and her face lost its color. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James seemed to sense her fear and gave her a reassuring look with a slight tilt of his eyes. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia, using some strength, pressed her fingers against the glass door, suppressing all her worries, and nodded gently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As James withdrew his gaze, his slender fingers slowly moved to his waist. 2-5's eyes were fixed on James' moving hand and he couldn't help but sneer. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Evans, the red dot on your body is now under my control. I advise you not to make any rash moves." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is that so?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the moment James' thin lips curled up with a faint smile, he quickly drew his gun from his waist. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James took a step back, aiming directly at 2-5's forehead before the sniper could shoot, and pulled the trigger. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In just a second, the bullet grazed Matty's ear and accurately blew off 2-5's head! </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, Matty quickly turned his body and modified the trajectory on the control panel. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matty managed to modify the direction just a second before the infrared beam erupted, allowing James to escape unharmed. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the wall was riddled with countless holes from the infrared beam, James silently shifted his gaze towards Matty. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two locked eyes, neither of them spoke, but they had the same understanding, which was to release Amelia. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, in the instant the bulletproof glass door opened, the escape pod's hatch opened first, and two men in black rushed towards Amelia.</span></p></div>
