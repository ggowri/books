        <h1>Chapter 1763 Divorce Agreement</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing the voice, James turned around with a cold face and saw Emily strolling over in high heels. Behind her was Mr. Ben holding a controller, accompanied by a group of black-clad men protecting their lives.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James's eyes locked onto the controller in Mr. Ben's hand. He had the list of S members, and 1-2 trusted him to give him control of the chip's controller.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If James were to kill Emily, Mr. Ben would use the controller to manipulate him. If he were to kill Mr. Ben, 1-2 would activate the chip program to make him submit. Among the few of them, a food chain had already formed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Whoever operated the controller for the chip in his brain didn't matter, as long as Amelia's permission to leave was in Emily's hands, which 1-2 had given her. Now, Emily held Amelia's life in her hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James raised his cold and distant eyebrows, looking at Emily coldly. "Where is the control console for breaking permissions?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The console he had used before was useless. He needed to find the control console for permissions in order to break the program.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's with 1-2, but unfortunately, you don't have permission to go to the upper level to find him," Emily replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every time Emily approached James, she was caught off guard and attacked by him. This time, she was smart and brought a group of black-clad men who had once subdued James.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking of how James had been cut open in the brain, bleeding profusely without making a sound, Emily's heart softened for a moment. But James was ungrateful!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She begged the black-clad men not to empty his mind but to implant the chip and help him conceal his identity. However, after waking up, he was indifferent and only had that damn Amelia on his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since that was the case, she would show him what a real life-and-death game was!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I have the list of 10 S members. I'll exchange it for half an hour. During that half-hour, she'll be safe. But after that, the snipers will..." Emily made a gesture of holding a gun to her lips, then laughed sinisterly, her scarred face becoming even more terrifying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In his anger, James didn't care if the broken screen would cut his hand. He pulled out a piece and charged at Emily at lightning speed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was skilled, but no match for the machine. With a light press on the controller, Mr. Ben made James's head feel like it was exploding, causing him to turn red-eyed and pale-faced from the pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had suffered from a brain tumor and couldn't bear the pain of the chip embedded inside him. Unfortunately, the chip developed by 1-2 could control the pain nerves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James was in excruciating pain. Seeing his pale lips, Emily raised her hand and gestured, prompting Mr. Ben to quickly shut off the pain system.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at James, she smiled and used lip language to tell him, "James, you are the leader of S, as is Holden and Master Davies. If you don't negotiate with me, your and their names will appear in 1-2's program room in an hour."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The killing intent in James's eyes was extremely cold. After sending Amelia away, he would definitely kill them, then proceed with the original plan to infiltrate the upper level, deal with 1-2, destroy the chip program, and then find 1-1 and 1-3, who had never been to Erebus. After resolving everything, he could safely return home to his and Amelia's home.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the exclusive space of the ninth round of the game, Amelia obediently waited at the door. She crouched in the corner, hugging her arms tightly, her already slender body appearing even more fragile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The surroundings were extremely quiet, with no sound except for her faint breathing, indicating that she was not a puppet but a living being. However, her eyes were empty and lifeless, devoid of any light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The screen on the door displayed a countdown. When the time was up, the place similar to an elevator where she was located would slowly descend and take her to where she needed to go.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she waited in despair, a cold and proud figure slowly walked in from outside the door. Amelia looked up, and when her eyes met that face, a glimmer of light appeared in her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Husband!" She suddenly got up from the ground and ran towards James. But before she could reach him, a document was suddenly handed to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Following James's long fingers, she looked down at the document, which had a few big words written on it&mdash;divorce agreement. Seeing these words, Amelia's heart felt as if it had been suddenly gripped by a large hand, making her hard to breathe.</span></p></div>
