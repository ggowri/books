        <h1>Chapter 1644 Stop with the proposal stuff</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he was extremely uneasy, Eva sent him a message. Paul quickly opened it and froze when he saw the words. After realizing what had happened, he quickly called Eva, but she didn't answer and hung up. When he called again, it showed that he had been blocked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul ended the call and returned to the chat interface, quickly typing a reply:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[Eva, what's wrong? Why won't you let me propose?]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as he sent the message, a red exclamation mark appeared in the conversation box, indicating that Eva had blocked him again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul frowned and looked at the message Eva had sent:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[Paul, stop with the proposal stuff. I won't marry you. That night was just a one-night stand, don't take it to heart.]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So... Eva didn't respond to him at the time because she was considering whether or not to accept his proposal. Now she has made up her mind and given him a clear answer?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had deliberately made it public, hoping she wouldn't be able to refuse. Who could have known that Eva would still be so heartless?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul was angry and threw his phone away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva took one step, and he took ten steps. He always thought he could change her stubborn heart, but he didn't expect it to be harder than a stone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He sat down on the couch in frustration, staring blankly for a while, then grabbed his phone again and rushed to Eva's place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Eva wasn't at home. Mandy said she hadn't come back last night. Paul thought Eva had gone to work the night shift at the nightclub, so he quickly drove there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the nightclub, the manager said the boss hadn't come and they couldn't find Eva. Worried, Paul called Amelia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia, who was busy with design drawings, put down her pen and measuring tape when she saw Paul's call and unlocked her phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Amelia, do you know where Eva went?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Amelia could ask, she heard Paul's anxious voice on the other end.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Isn't she at home?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul's anxious tone made Amelia worried too.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If she's not at home, she might be at the nightclub. Have you looked for her there?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing Amelia's words, Paul knew that she also didn't know where Eva was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Amelia, she sent me a message rejecting my proposal and blocked me. Can you help me call her?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia's worried mood gradually turned into surprise upon hearing that Eva rejected Paul's proposal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why would she reject you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul felt uncomfortable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't know either."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul was used to Eva rejecting him, but it still annoyed him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She clearly had feelings for him, so why did she keep rejecting him over and over </span><span>again? What did she take him for?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's impossible."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia furrowed her eyebrows slightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She told me that if you proposed to her, she might accept. How could she suddenly reject you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It had only been a day, and she had already rejected him. There must be a reason behind this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul didn't need much thinking to figure out who was behind all of this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It must be my parents who talked to her privately. Amelia, I'm going to the old house. Can you call Eva and tell her not to be afraid, that I'll handle everything?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Paul finished speaking, he hung up the phone and quickly drove to the old house.</span></p></div>
