        <h1>Chapter 1206 Amelia guessed who James’ real mother was (2)</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing this sentence, James' blood ran cold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The expression in his eyes was more shocked than when Gloria admitted that she had changed Simon's medicine herself...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He sat still, not moving a muscle, but his face gradually turned pale. She knew the truth now, would she divorce him...?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia knew she was right when she saw his appearance. "How could you not tell me about this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James raised her dark red eyes, weakly staring at her face. "If I tell you, what would you do? Divorce me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She frowned. "If you really are related to the Clark family, it involves the norms of ethics and morality. I find it difficult to cross that gap, but..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't finish her sentence before her red lips were blocked by his fingers. "Stop talking. I will never divorce you. Give up on that idea."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her eyes widened slowly. Even though he knew they had a "kinship" relationship, he still refused to divorce her and even wanted to keep it a secret from her for the rest of their lives. It seemed that her husband had no moral bottom line...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not only did James have no moral bottom line, but he also felt restless and anxious because she found out about this. "Regardless of whether you can cross that gap or not, you must stay by my side. I cannot be without you..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia was no stranger to his dominance and tyranny, but she used to think that James&rsquo; love for her was the kind that would sacrifice everything. Now she knew that </span><span>his love was far greater than that...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, he was once a "third party" for her, and now he has lost his "morality". Will he still sacrifice his life for her in the future?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia didn't want to think too much about the future, so she pushed away the hand blocking her lips and asked, "Is your mother Alice or the illegitimate daughter named Ashley?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James saw that she already knew about Ashley, so there was no point in hiding it anymore. He gritted his teeth and admitted, "Ashley."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia understood. Herb had mentioned that one of the three sisters was not a member of the Clark family, but she didn't know who it was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she was lost in thought, James suddenly grabbed her chin and made her look at him. "Are you thinking about getting a divorce?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She opened her lips, "No..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before she could finish her sentence, James interrupted her with red eyes, "We're just cousins, not siblings. It's not a big deal. Please don't get a divorce..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia, whose words were interrupted twice, looked at the man in pain and frowned slightly, "Even if we're just cousins, we're still blood relatives. How can your moral bottom line be so low..."</span></p></div>
