        <h1>Chapter 1932 Commit suicide to apologize</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Evans family found Matty and demanded an apology from him, or else they would never let him go.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rebecca was the one who said this. Now that Dominic was dead, Rebecca was in charge of the entire mansion, so when she learned that Matty had operated on James and removed the chip, she brought the Evans family to the Lawrence family. Matty actually had the ability to suppress them, but since he was the one who owed them in the first place, he didn't say much and allowed the Evans family to accuse him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Rebecca and her brothers caused a commotion at the Lawrence family, she finally spoke up and said, "I'm not asking you to sacrifice your life, but you must find a way to remove the chip from my brother's brain, no matter what..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I have an old doctor here who is quite skilled in brain surgery. I'll take him to see James first and then make a promise, okay?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rebecca, leaning against the sofa with her arms crossed, raised her chin coldly and said, "You're the one who put that chip in. If your old doctor can't remove it and cure my brother, you must commit suicide to apologize!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing the united Evans family, Matty thought of his own descendants and nodded, "Alright, I promise you."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he could do something for Amelia before he died, it would be good, but the chip in James' brain was indeed quite tricky.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matty returned to China with the old doctor, Moore, without even having a chance to see Amelia.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, he was forced by Rebecca to go see James first. James was like a soulless zombie, allowing the doctors to do whatever they wanted without any reaction, as if he had suddenly lost the will to live, appearing so hopeless.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After examining James' brain and evaluating the possibility of removing the chip and preventing a virus outbreak, Moore secretly shook his head at Matty.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing this, Matty glanced at Rebecca and said, "After I see my granddaughter and leave some last words, I will come back to apologize."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rebecca and the Evans family were stunned in place after hearing this. "Your doctor can save a patient even when their heart stops, but he can't remove a small chip?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What the Evans family cared about more than Matty's life was James' life. In this regard, they were similar to the Lawrence family.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matty felt that it was quite good for Amelia to marry into such a family.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matty, leaning on his cane with a sense of guilt, walked up to Rebecca and said, "The chip in James' brain is not a small obstacle, but a virus that I developed, which can endanger human life."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at Matty's aged face, Rebecca's face turned red with anger. "James is Amelia's husband, and Amelia is your granddaughter. Yet you want to kill your granddaughter's husband. You are truly heartless!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It was implanted by my subordinates, and I am sorry for that. Let me talk to Amelia and then I will come to apologize..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rebecca's eyes turned red as she stared at Matty, wanting to kill him right now. But considering that he was Amelia's grandfather, she forcibly suppressed her anger.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She turned her head away and ignored Matty.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matty knew that Rebecca had agreed, so he led his people and left the ward, heading to the ward where Amelia was.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that time, Amelia had already woken up and saw Eva sitting by her bedside, holding the baby and feeding him with a bottle.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She furrowed her brows lightly and asked, "Eva, this child..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing Amelia's voice, Eva suddenly looked up and saw that Amelia had woken up.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She felt relieved and replied, "This is your child..." Eva observed Amelia's condition as she said this.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing that she didn't have any major emotional fluctuations, she continued, "It was because of this little guy that you fell into a coma for half a year..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia's gaze shifted from Eva's face to the chubby baby. "Are you saying that I risked my own safety to give birth to him?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She said this with some disbelief. She loved Ryan, but not to the extent of risking her life for him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How could she love James so much that she was willing to risk her life to have his child?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva sighed when she saw the disbelief in Amelia's eyes. "Amelia, if it weren't for the baby, you wouldn't have lost your memory, let alone forget about James."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span> In the end, it was all Dominic's fault for keeping it a secret and causing Amelia to get pregnant.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he had told them earlier, two people who loved each other so much could have been together, even without a child.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Did it have to come to this, with one losing her memory and the other waiting to die?</span></p></div>
