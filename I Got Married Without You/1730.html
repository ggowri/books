        <h1>Chapter 1730 Going crazy</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva decided to stay and keep Amelia company, and Amelia didn't refuse. She knew that in times like these, the people around her would silently stay by her side and offer comfort.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't cry or make a fuss, she was quiet and calm, letting Eva take care of her. Occasionally, she would also help Grace with her homework. Everything was peaceful, just like before, with no differences at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Frank and Peter believed that Amelia would slowly recover from her grief, which was a relief for them. After all, they had lost their master, and now the only thing keeping them going was their remaining mistress.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And the lady, after making everyone lower their guard, picked up Zack's urn and went to the hospital.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ever since Gigi found out about Zack's passing, she has been bedridden and surviving on IV nutrition.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Amelia appeared with the urn, Gigi, who had stopped crying, couldn't hold back her tears once again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But this time, she didn't rush over to hit Amelia like before, or blame Amelia. She just cried silently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia suppressed the pain in her heart and walked to Gigi's hospital bed, handing her the heavy urn in her hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;He is your fianc&eacute;.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gigi reached out her trembling fingers and took the urn from Zack's hands, as if caressing her beloved. Her warm fingertips slowly glided over the cold box...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He was so tall, but who would have thought he'd end up trapped in such a small box."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gigi lifted her teary and misty eyes, looking at Amelia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you think he'll be uncomfortable living there?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing this, Amelia couldn't hold back her tears that she had been suppressing for almost a week, and they started rolling down her cheeks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She bent down and hugged Gigi, her fair fingers gently stroking Gigi's hair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia's warm gesture caused Gigi, who had been pretending to be strong for days, to suddenly break down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She clutched the urn tightly and leaned into Amelia's embrace, crying like a child and trembling all over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Amelia, he promised to come back and marry me, how could he just abandon me like this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gigi cried and poured her heart out about Zack's cruelty, but after learning about James' history of protecting Zack since childhood, she slowly began to understand Zack. However, she couldn't accept his departure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What am I supposed to do if he can't even give our child a name when it's born?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gigi was not only devastated by Zack's departure, but also felt helpless for losing the father of her unborn child.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia held back her crumbling emotions and gently patted Gigi's back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry, someone will give the child a name."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Really?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gigi retorted and then grabbed Amelia to ask again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What name should we engrave on Zack's tombstone?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Zack is just a code name, he doesn't have a last name, you can't carve a code name, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After finding out that they were members of S, Johnny looked into Zack, whose code name was S0883 and had no last name.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They didn't know whose child he was, or how he got into S. All they knew was that Zack had spent his entire life serving S.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gigi felt heartbroken for Zack, wishing she could spend the rest of her life with him and take care of him, but she never got the chance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia felt a wave of pain in her heart, remaining silent the whole time, unable to find the right words to comfort Gigi.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Gigi had calmed her emotions, she touched the urn again and a small smile appeared on her lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Zane, even though it's a fake name. But the first time I met him, he introduced himself as Zane."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wanted to make that Zack would always be her Zane.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she thought about it, Gigi's smile quickly faded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Amelia, I can't believe Zack is dead, I refuse to believe that he died like this..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She set down the urn and pushed Amelia, who was hugging her, aside. Then she lifted the covers and got out of bed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm going to go find him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia, who was pushed to the side, stared blankly at Gigi who was hastily putting on her shoes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She hurriedly put on her shoes, but her whole body was trembling so she couldn't get them on...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was so anxious that she didn't bother to put on any shoes and ran outside barefoot. But she was stopped by Johnny, who had just entered the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The doctor said that her emotions have been unstable lately, affecting her nerves and causing some strange behavior."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After explaining to Amelia, Johnny grabbed Gigi and forcefully pushed her back onto the hospital bed, reminding her coldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Zack is dead."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gigi didn't believe it and struggled to push Johnny away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the two argued, they accidentally bumped into the urn sitting on the side, causing it to fall to the ground with a loud thud.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Gigi saw what rolled out from inside, she was stunned, staring blankly at the sections on the ground, even catching a faint smell of snake from the broken bones...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those bones, as if they had a sense of awareness, pulled back the gradually crazed Gigi, causing her disordered nervous system to gradually return to normal.</span></p></div>
