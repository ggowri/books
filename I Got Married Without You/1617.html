        <h1>Chapter 1617 The 29th day</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stella promised Amelia that she would video chat with her every day, but on the 29th day, Stella didn't answer any calls. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia held her phone with a black screen, feeling increasingly uneasy and realizing that something was wrong. Erin seemed to have set a deadline for a month...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She quickly left the study and went to find James, only to see him answering a phone call with a serious expression she had never seen before. She hesitated to approach, afraid of hearing bad news. She stopped in her tracks, silently watching his tall figure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No matter what, you can't give up, keep saving people," James instructed, hanging up the phone and turning to look at Amelia. He noticed the nervous and fearful emotions in her eyes and furrowed his brows slightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is something wrong with Stella?" Amelia stepped on the soft carpet, slowly walking towards James. As she got closer, she could see the regretful emotions in the man's eyes more clearly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James didn't want Amelia to worry, but she would eventually find out about this matter. After a moment of hesitation, he nodded gently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She committed suicide."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The local police in Panama called and said that after Stella confessed and sent a message, she chose to shoot herself. By the time they arrived, she had already lost too much blood and showed no signs of life. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James didn't want to give up and insisted that the local police continue to try to save her, but even the bullet pierced through the glass of the landing window, making it impossible to save her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Amelia heard that Stella had committed suicide, her petite body suddenly stiffened in place. Even her feet on the carpet felt cold, as if she had been placed in an ice cave and couldn't feel the outside temperature. It was so cold...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James quickly reached out and pulled her into his embrace. His large, comforting </span><span>hands gently stroked her back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This was Stella's choice."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was her choice, and no one could stop it, including Amelia, who had tried her best to warm Stella. Because from the beginning, they had misunderstood one thing: Stella still loved Erin. It was because of that love that Stella felt life was unbearable and ultimately chose death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If they had known from the beginning that Stella still loved Erin, they might have had a chance to save her. But there were no "ifs." Stella's actions from start to finish showed that she no longer loved Erin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia, leaning against James, tightly grasped his shirt as a wave of self-blame, regret, and heartache overwhelmed her, causing her tears to burst out uncontrollably.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If she had gone with Stella to the free clinic, Stella wouldn't have had the time to do something foolish, and Amelia wouldn't have had to hear about her suicide...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Stella, she loved Erin so much. She loved him to the point that she didn't even show a hint of grief or anger after his death. She simply arranged everything calmly and then went to Panama to fulfill Erin's last wish, to be buried together with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the moment when Amelia's tears fell, she finally understood the meaning of the 29 days. But why didn't she guess it earlier? It was because she thought that Stella didn't love.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They all thought that, including Eva and Andrew. Everyone around Stella thought she didn't love Erin, and some even hated him so much that they wished he would die.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stella pretended very well, deceiving everyone, including herself. Because of this, even Erin thought before his death that Stella didn't love him...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia couldn't perceive what Stella felt when she realized this, but she could only feel the regret in this emotion. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The kind of regret that made her want to cry every time she thought about it. To think that someone Erin believed Stella didn't love him anymore, and died in such a tragic way. And to think that Stella pretended not to love Erin anymore, and died in such a miserable way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But they had never truly loved each other during their lives. Even during the few </span><span>years</span><span> they were together, Stella deceived Erin without a trace of sincerity. So how could they not feel regret?</span></p></div>
