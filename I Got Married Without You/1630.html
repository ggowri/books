        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was overjoyed, while Eva covered her face and opened the door to the master bedroom. "Mandy, why didn't you wake me up last night?&rdquo; Eva asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mandy smiled awkwardly and replied, "How could I have the nerve to wake you up..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Last night, she heard that noise and thought Paul was bullying Eva, so she hurried to the master bedroom. But just as she was about to put her hand on the door handle, she heard Eva moaning in pleasure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though she was getting older, Mandy couldn't help but blush when she heard the voices of the two. She knew they were reconciling and repairing their relationship, so she didn't disturb them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Furthermore, seeing Eva's shy appearance now, Mandy realized the two must&rsquo;ve had sex last night. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you still have feelings for Paul, then be with him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva, awakened by these words, stared at Mandy for a few seconds, then turned and looked at the man in the bathroom...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Was it because she still had feelings for him that she didn't refuse him after realizing who he was last night? She wondered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though she was drunk and not in the right mind at first, she became somewhat sober after vomiting. At that moment, she recognized the person in front of her as Paul and let him approach her without any defenses. If it were someone else, they probably wouldn't have been able to get close to her...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking of this, Eva sighed softly. So, it was because he was Paul that she did such a thing with him, but...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Was he really sincere when he said he wanted to marry her?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Eva!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia's voice interrupted Eva's wandering thoughts, and she quickly turned around to look at the woman who had already stepped onto the escalator.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Go and help me get my coat."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mandy hurriedly rushed into the dressing room and, in her haste, grabbed a winter coat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva, who was already conspicuous, became even more so when she wrapped herself in the coat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia had called Eva several times, but she didn&rsquo;t answer any of them. After experiencing what happened with Stella, she was worried and rushed over in a panic, fearing that something might have happened to Eva, who had been drinking heavily lately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But when she arrived upstairs, she saw Eva wearing a fur coat and an awkward smile...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia stood there, staring at her up and down. "Eva, are you planning to skip winter?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva laughed awkwardly and quickly waved her hand. "No, I just bought this coat and wanted to try it on. Look, isn't it nice?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wrapped herself in the coat and turned around in front of Amelia, but due to her exaggerated movements, the hickeys on her neck got exposed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing the hickeys, even Amelia, who was slow to catch on, knew what had happened to Eva. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mandy, have you been breeding a lot of mosquitoes recently? How did my Eva get bitten like that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unable to hold back, Mandy burst into laughter. At the same time, there was a sound coming from the master bedroom bathroom, and Amelia instinctively looked up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia asked, "Tell me who's inside."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva pointed her freshly manicured finger and poked Amelia's shoulder. "You're asking just to tease me..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia, who knew she was being teased, laughed. "Oh, so it's Paul..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, Paul, wrapped in a towel, walked confidently to the floor-to-ceiling window...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man downstairs in the Converse sneakers raised his cold, icy gaze and looked in the direction of the window, just in time to see his younger brother standing in front of the window.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With his hands on his hips, he had a proud look on his face, as if he wanted to tell the whole world that he had a wonderful night with Eva.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James stared at him for two seconds, rolled his eyes, and then pressed the button to roll up the car window, isolating everything outside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul also saw James' car and quickly turned around, took out his own phone from his pants pocket, and called his older brother. He wanted to share the good news with James.</span></p></div>
