        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James returned to the study quickly, with his long legs, and took out his phone to make a call.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carol, who had already fallen asleep, was awakened by the phone call. She was </span><span>surprised to see that it was James calling her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James never called her first, so why was he calling so late at night?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She stretched out her wrinkled fingers and pressed the answer button, "Hello..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James didn't even bother with pleasantries, he just said coldly, "Evans Corporation's shares, I'll give you back 10%, and I'll give your son an additional 5% in stock options. That secret you're keeping, you'll take it to the grave. Also, don't try to incite the Evans family to go after my wife again, or you and your son will have nowhere to hide!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Carol heard that James was going to give her shares and increase her son's stock options, her mouth curved up in a smile. But before she could widen it, the words "nowhere to hide" froze her lips. "You..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James interrupted her, "You have five seconds to think about it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was clearly coercion!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carol cursed him, "You can try if you have the guts," but nodded her head during the countdown, "Okay, I agree."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her husband had died a long time ago, and over the years, her resentment had faded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Being able to exchange this secret for shares and ensure her son's future, even her grandchildren's future, would be worry-free.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The goal has been achieved, so Carol will naturally accept it. As for the other Evans family members who were encouraged by her but did not get any equity back, what does it have to do with her?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If the other family members question her about how she was able to get back the shares, she will just push everything onto Dominic and let him face it himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carol's plan was well thought out, but she didn't expect James to be so smart and figure out so quickly that she was the one who encouraged the other family members. J really lives up to being the one in power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However... it's not easy to get an advantage from James, so why not take the opportunity to get another benefit? "I have a daughter, and I also want her to have a 5% increase in stock options. I can exchange it with another secret. What do you think?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James, who was planning to hang up the phone, heard this and slowly put down his finger. "If it's not an important matter, you wouldn't be proposing a trade with me. You know my methods."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although it was a threat, Carol was not afraid. "It's related to your father and older brother. I don't think it's an unimportant matter, do you?"</span></p></div>
