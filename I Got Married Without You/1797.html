        <h1>Chapter 1797 Triplets</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dylan left, and Johnny and Paul returned to ask Amelia why Dylan had come to see her. Amelia said that he had come to do a DNA test. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When she said this, everyone in the hospital room was stunned. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva, however, was overjoyed and grabbed Amelia's hand. "Amelia, this is great! Your family has finally found you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva's eyes were filled with tears, as if it were her own family who had found her. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The results aren't out yet, so don't get too excited," Amelia cautioned. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were many people in the world who look alike, and not all of them were related by blood. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then I'll get excited when the results come out," Eva said. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva was pregnant, and her body and face had become much rounder. When she spoke, she seemed a bit cute. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia couldn't help but poke her chubby little hand. "Paul is taking good care of you. You've gotten so plump." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul was proud of the praise and raised his chin. "Of course, my wife is pregnant, so I have to take good care of her." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul's words made Eva push him, and Paul didn't realize what he had said until he saw </span><span>how thin and frail Amelia looked. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He regretted speaking without thinking and quickly tried to make amends. "Amelia, I'll take care of you just like I take care of Eva." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia's husband had not been by her side since she became pregnant, and her face had become thin and frail, like a piece of paper. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul felt sorry for her and didn't know when James would return. That would be very regrettable if he missed Amelia's entire pregnancy. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia didn't think about it too much. "Just take good care of Eva. I can take care of myself." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, Eva couldn't help but blush again. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing that she was about to cry again, Amelia asked her to go and rest, but Eva refused. Just then, the food that Johnny had ordered arrived. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia asked Eva to eat with her to change the subject. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After the meal, Amelia asked Johnny about Gigi's situation. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Johnny said that while they were away, Gigi had a breakdown and had been uncontrollable, causing her to bleed several times. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fortunately, there were many people watching over her at the time, and she was treated in time to save the baby, but the doctor said that if she continued to be so agitated, it would be difficult. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Johnny also said that Gigi was emotionally unstable, so they hadn't told her yet. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They would let the two of them meet once Amelia's health improved. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After hearing this, Amelia felt very upset. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While Amelia was dealing with Zack's deep emotional pain, the DNA test report from Dylan came out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead of finding Amelia immediately, he went back to the Lawrence family's temporary residence in Arcadia to see Matty. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Grandfather." Dylan pushed open the door to the study and handed the DNA test report to Matty, who was working on some code. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The DNA test between you and Amelia has come out, and as you guessed, she is indeed your granddaughter." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With just one look, Matty confirmed that Amelia was his descendant. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stopped what he was doing and took the report. "It seems that Sophia really did give birth to triplets, but why did she lie to me?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he went to see Sophia, her servant gave him a video she had left behind, in which she said that she had only given birth to two children for him. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Did she hate him so much? Hate him enough to send her favorite daughter away, just to punish him for losing his daughter? </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sophia was a particularly cold and ruthless woman, and the more Matty thought about it, the more he felt that she was capable of doing such a thing. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But her choice of revenge was too cruel. "She's really ruthless to use this method to retaliate against me!" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matty was very angry and threw the report in his hand, looking very upset. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Grandfather was angry, Dylan didn't dare to speak and just stood by, waiting for Matty to calm down. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking about how his daughter and granddaughter had lived so miserably, Matty couldn't help but feel heartbroken. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Lawrence family had plenty of money, but his daughter, </span><span>Sumasa</span><span>, had starved and frozen to death. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't bear to think about </span><span>Sumasa</span><span> freezing to death on the streets of England, with no one to collect her body. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He only knew that he was now both angry and resentful. "The day after tomorrow is the anniversary of her death, but I won't go to see her. Tell your mother not to bother with it anymore." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dylan was taken aback. Grandfather wasn't even going to Sophia's memorial service. Was he really that angry? </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dylan didn't dare to ask Matty too much and just agreed. "Okay, I'll call my mom." After informing his mother, Dylan returned to the study.</span></p></div>
