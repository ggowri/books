        <h1>Chapter 1955 Be My Woman</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After standing there for a long time, Dylan mustered up his courage, pulled out a chair next to the bed, and slowly sat down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Consequently, their eyes would unavoidably lock. Michelle could only bow her head to avoid his gaze, but Dylan reached out to grab her wrist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're already divorced. Are you going to be my woman?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tears welled up in Michelle's eyes as she gazed at his delicate fingers on her wrist. Even though she had become so miserable, instead of despising her, Dylan asked her if she wanted to be with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Having endured a prolonged hell, Michelle couldn't help but feel touched. However, being married with a daughter, she felt unworthy of Dylan, who had never been involved in any scandals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dylan."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Michelle pushed Dylan's hand away with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's better for me to be your adopted sister."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Michelle didn't speak negatively about herself but gently and distantly rejected Dylan, as if never harboring any affection for him. She was remarkably composed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I have always regarded you as brother, so even if your mother didn't force me to get married, I would never be in a relationship with you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dylan stared into Michelle's starry eyes, attempting to discern any signs of deceit, only to find them calm and serene.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a long time, following his slight nod and release of her hand, he straightened his suit and rose from the chair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ignore what I said earlier."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dylan left. Michelle, covering her cheeks, cried uncontrollably. Yet, she knew that her choice was right because a man like Dylan deserved a better woman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon being discharged from the hospital, Michelle returned to her residence and embarked on a life as a single mother with her daughter. Thankfully, her career and her busy days with Stephanie helped her to let all the bad things go quickly.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Michelle and Dylan had originally become two parallel lines that would never intersect. Unexpectedly, at a cocktail party, Dylan was given some philter by a woman who coveted him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Michelle was present as well. Dylan spotted her in the crowd and at a glance. Unable to wait for the doctor, he instructed his secretary to bring her over directly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was restrained and polite. Upon her entrance into the room, he inquired if she was willing. She declined and persuaded him to wait for the doctor. However, as she opened the door to leave, he seized her and pinned her against the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suppressing the effects of the drugs, Dylan lowered his gaze and locked eyes with Michelle. "That day, you said you didn't want to be with me, but after I left, you cried for so long. It's clear that you feel inferior and unworthy of me because of being once married and having a daughter. Michelle, but..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He extended his hand and gently lifted her chin, bringing her closer to meet his gaze. "I don't mind at all. I'm even willing to treat your daughter as my own if you choose to be with me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Michelle caught the scent of alcohol and the fragrance emanating from Dylan's shirt, her long-hidden love for him surged uncontrollably from the depths of her heart. "You're aware of everything."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dylan narrowed his eyes and nodded slightly. "Yes, I'm aware of everything. So what do you think?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Michelle, in her disturbed state of mind, could not make out what was passing in her mind. Her daughter was already eight years old, but Dylan had never been married. Therefore, Michelle didn't believe she was a good match for him. Yet, as she hesitated, he suddenly bent his head and kissed her directly.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Possibly influenced by the philter, he couldn't stop himself. Before urgently tearing off Michelle's clothes, overcome with excitement, he solemnly promised, "I will marry you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At first, Michelle believed that she wasn't good enough for him and that Dylan would tarnish himself by kissing her. However, upon witnessing him resort to drugs as a means of releasing his pent-up restraint and yearning over the years, she slowly lowered her struggling hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After having sex with Michelle, Dylan promptly arranged a wedding date, anxious that she might flee. He swiftly extended an invitation to Amelia, urging her to bring Alexander back to Verodian for the wedding.</span></p></div>
