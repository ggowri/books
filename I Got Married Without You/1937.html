        <h1>Chapter 1937 Leave this world with you</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James wasn't bothered by her amnesia, but rather by the fact that she only remembers Ryan and has forgotten him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He must have thought that deep down in her heart, Ryan was the one she loved the most.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And indeed, she remembers Ryan, not him. Amelia herself doesn't understand why it's like this.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her pensive silence didn't go unnoticed by James. He felt a momentary pang of sadness, but quickly suppressed his emotions.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He let go of her hand and gently caressed her face.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's alright. As long as you're okay, it doesn't matter if Ryan is the one you love the most."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had gone through a life-threatening childbirth, complications, and almost died. The fact that she woke up and is alive is already a miracle. Why would he care about who she loves the most?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, all James ever wanted in his life was for Amelia and their child to be healthy.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now that Amelia has woken up safely and their child is out of danger, what does his own insignificant feelings matter?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia didn't expect that James would let it go before she could even give an answer. Even if she loved Ryan more, he wouldn't mind anymore.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at James' thin and well-defined face, Amelia slowly turned her palm and tightly held onto James' fingers. "When I loved Ryan, the only thing I could do for him was to marry him. But you..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She raised her other hand and touched James' thick hair, her fingertips sliding from his forehead to the back of his head. "If one day, the chip in your brain takes you away, I will without hesitation leave this world with you."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her voice was resolute like never before, as if it had a magical power that instantly dispelled the loneliness surrounding James.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It made him realize that in this world, it wasn't just him alone. There was a woman who was willing to love him with her life.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia didn't tell James who she loved the most deep in her heart.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She only told him that she would follow him to death. In the face of such unwavering conviction, any answer seemed insignificant.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As long as Amelia said she didn't love him, James' will to live would collapse.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But as long as she said she still loved him, the collapsed pieces, even if they fell into hell, could be rebuilt.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That slight grievance in his heart dissipated into thin air with just one sentence from Amelia.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He felt as if his soul had returned to its rightful place, suddenly shedding the sense of brokenness and being filled with worry and fear.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He slightly turned his eyes and looked at Amelia's fingers stroking his hair. Suddenly, he reached out and grabbed her hand, then looked up at her. "Did Matty tell you that I have a chip in my brain?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia nodded slightly, a hint of hatred appearing in her eyes. "I never expected him to develop such a despicable thing, let alone use you as an experiment."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James stared at Amelia and said in a deep voice, "He must have lied to you to stimulate your memory recovery. Such a thing doesn't exist in this world."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this point, James still wanted to hide it from her, just to prevent her from following him to death. His love for her truly ran deep.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia didn't say much, she just freed her hand from his grasp and continued to stroke the back of his head until she felt a small scar through his thick hair.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With teary eyes, she asked him, "Was it inserted from here?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't know that James had his head forcefully opened and the chip implanted. If she knew, she would probably feel even more heartbroken for him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though James had gone through such pain, he denied it to prevent her from doing something foolish. "It's just a scar from accidentally hitting a sharp object."</span></p></div>
