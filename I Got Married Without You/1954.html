        <h1>Chapter 1954 Domestic Violence</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dylan harbored some hatred toward Michelle. He could unmistakably sense that she had feelings for him, yet she chose to marry Alan, a good-for-nothing who was only noteworthy for his affluent family background. Dylan couldn't comprehend what Michelle saw in Alan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, he understood that she was attracted by Alan's ability to flirt, coax, and beat women. Dylan sneered that she deserved it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, a sense of discomfort still overwhelmed him, particularly when he woke up in the middle of the night after dreaming that Michelle came to him and pleaded for his help with a swollen face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He lost sleep. At midnight, he lifted the quilt and stood by the window, staring in a daze at the room across the yard where Michelle had lived before she got married.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All he could recall was Michelle in his dream, grabbing his hand and shouting repeatedly, "Dylan, save me. I'm dying. Please come and save me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't figure out what this dream meant. However, upon learning that Michelle had jumped off the building, Dylan realized that she had been living in dire straits.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Michelle had suffered from domestic violence since her marriage to Alan. Whenever it got beyond her, she would turn to the Lawrence family to complain. Still, Dylan's mother, who had raised her, would advise her to endure it, dissuade her from seeking a divorce, and caution her against informing Dylan of the situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Michelle had no choice but to bear it on her own. Until recently, Alan supported several mistresses and became crazier and crazier. Although she didn't care, he insisted on slandering her for meddling in his affairs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Subsequently, Alan began assaulting her, initially with his fists and later with weapons, and nearly inflicted fatal harm on her. Yet, unsatisfied, he proceeded to target their eight-year-old daughter, subjecting her to such severe beatings that she convulsed uncontrollably. It was only at this point that Michelle summoned all her strength to resist Alan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they fought, Michelle simply made up her mind to kill herself and Alan, dragging him to the balcony in an attempt to push him over the edge. However, he, being stronger, clutched the railing and prevented himself from falling while she plunged to the ground and broke her legs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This incident caused a sensation and made headlines. Subsequently, the Lawrence family became aware of the kind of life Michelle had been enduring for years. Upon hearing the news, Dylan, wearing an icy expression, silently hurried to Alan's house with an iron rod.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without hesitation, he instructed the bodyguards to hold Alan down and mercilessly shattered his legs with an iron rod. Dylan also pretended to cut off Alan's genitals accidentally. Upon completing these acts, Dylan seized Alan's neck and told him that this was the consequence of tormenting Michelle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite being sued by Alan, Dylan managed to have him jailed for domestic violence. Following his imprisonment and release, Dylan sought revenge on Alan's family like a madman. It wasn't until he had completely taken over Alan's family business that his vendetta finally came to an end.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After handling the situation, he wavered for quite some time but eventually mustered the courage to visit Michelle in the hospital. Coincidentally, he overheard a conversation between his mother and Michelle, leading him to realize that Michelle's rejection of him and her marriage to Alan were solely the result of his mother's covert manipulation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dylan erupted in anger and engaged in a heated argument with his mother. Ultimately, he assumed the role of the head of the Lawrence family, asserting dominance over his mother and cautioning her against meddling in his affairs in the future. Otherwise, he would disregard their mother-son relationship.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His mother became so furious that she fell ill and had to be hospitalized. Upon learning about these events, River finally understood the message Matty had conveyed before passing away. He also started persuading Dylan's mother to refrain from intervening in Dylan's life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dylan, who had resolved to remain unmarried, was suddenly heartbroken at the sight of Michelle staring out of the window with a look of despair in a hospital bed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He pushed open the door of the ward and walked in. "Some time ago, I sent a lawyer to file for divorce for you. Now, you and that bastard are no longer husband and wife."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing Dylan's voice, Michelle shifted her gaze from the window to him. Compared to his noble and elegant appearance, she looked more haggard and deeply embarrassed after her experience of domestic violence.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Apart from these two words, Michelle didn't know what to say. Dylan, standing at the end of the bed, was equally at a loss for words. They were silent, and only the time slipped by.&#8203;</span></p></div>
