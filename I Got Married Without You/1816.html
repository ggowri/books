        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia hugged her arms tightly and gazed at the night view outside the window. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under the streetlight, a majestic and imposing figure was reflected. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia thought that Matty had already left, but she was surprised to see him standing in the garden, gazing at her. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After staring at him for a while, she put on a thick coat, changed her shoes, and went to the garden. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matty seemed surprised to see her coming out. When he saw her, he was both surprised and touched. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without saying anything, Amelia walked a few steps forward. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matty quickly caught up with her and said, "Your grandmother may seem tough, but she is actually very gentle, just like you." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia replied, "I am not Sophia." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matty nodded and said, "I know you are not her, but blood ties are something that runs deep in the bones and flows in the blood. You are undoubtedly like your grandmother." Amelia looked at the old man walking beside her and asked, "I am curious, why did you fall in love with Sophia and why did you hurt her first love? Can you tell me about the past?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was trying to get information from him, and Matty understood, but he did not hide anything: "That year, I was sixteen, and it was my birthday banquet. She came with her friends to attend the banquet and played the piano." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Speaking of this, Matty rarely showed a genuine smile: "To be honest, your grandmother's piano playing was really not good, and I told her that. She got angry." Matty lowered his gaze and looked at the petite Amelia: "At that time, I was already the designated heir of the Lawrence family, and everyone was flattering and fawning over me, except for her, she was the only one who challenged me." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matty said that at that time, he just found this girl interesting. It was later when he fell into the pool, and Sophia came to his rescue like an angel. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matty felt indebted to her, and that's when he started to have contact with her. However, at that time, Sophia had a childhood sweetheart who understood her better than Matty, who was dominant and didn't know how to communicate. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Sophia and her childhood sweetheart confirmed their relationship at the age of eighteen, Matty was so angry that he took Sophia away and locked her in a room, doing some bold things that scared her. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After this incident, they stopped seeing each other. It was Sophia's first love who found out that Matty was coveting Sophia, and he repeatedly provoked and challenged him, which led to Matty hurting Sophia's first love and won her. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Matty talked about this, he showed no remorse. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He believed that Sophia belonged to him. After talking about his own story, he began to ask Amelia: "What about you, how was your childhood?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia replied without much emotion, "Didn't you investigate my background?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matty said, "I did investigate, but only had a general idea, I don't know the specifics." Amelia was unwilling to talk more, "There's nothing worth mentioning."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She exuded a sense of loneliness, which made Matty's eyes darken: "Amelia, I know </span><span>you've had a difficult life, I..." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He paused, and under the streetlight, his eyes, tinged with red, gazed gently into Amelia's clear eyes: "I will make it up to you." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia smiled faintly, her eyes filled with indifference: "What I wanted in my childhood, I didn't get at the time. Getting it later in life won't bring me joy." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matty understood the meaning behind Amelia's words, "Apart from what you wanted in your childhood, is there something you want at this moment?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a moment of silence, Amelia looked up at the stars and said, "I want the stars. I want to hold a children's book and tell stories to my child, do prenatal education." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matty initially misunderstood her and made a comment about stars and children's books. However, he soon realized that Amelia was referring to James as the "star." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked at Amelia's profile as she gazed at the stars and asked, "</span><span>Is James important to you?</span><span>"</span></p></div>
