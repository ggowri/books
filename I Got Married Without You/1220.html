        <h1>Chapter 1220 Herb and Jonny are not in cahoots</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When James gave the warning, Amelia was already mentally prepared. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now that she sees this group of people planning to tie up Herb as well, she doesn't quite understand Jonny's thought process. Why tie up their own people? </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia saw Peter being pinned down and quickly shouted, "Andrew!" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Jonny's men can rush in, Amelia received a message from James saying that he left Andrew for them. If Peter can't handle it, they can call on Andrew for help. Although Amelia didn&rsquo;t know where Andrew is hiding, the moment she shouted his name, the door to the VIP room bursts opened and he came in with a group of well-dressed bodyguards. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You leave here first!" Andrew only had time to say this before he and his men joined the fight. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Amelia replied with a "Okay," she looked towards the door. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jonny's men disguised themselves as kidnappers and forced the store employees to </span><span>close the door the moment they entered. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Other safety exits were also blocked, and the customers present were all trapped inside. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If she wanted to leave during the chaos, she would have to find a way to get past the guards stationed at each exit. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yes, Jonny's men were quite clever. Not everyone joined the fight, but a small group was sent to guard the exits to prevent anyone from escaping. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Herb was probably used to being kidnapped since he didn&rsquo;t seem too shocked by the situation. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He even wanted to join in and practice his fighting skills, but when he saw Amelia checking the exits, he put away his eager fists.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He patted Amelia's shoulder and whispered, "Sis, if you want to leave here, come with me..." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia thought this plan was discussed between Herb and Jonny, but when she saw Herb foolishly recording, looking like he didn't know anything, and almost being kidnapped together, she was sure that Herb and Jonny were not accomplices. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, she felt relieved and asked Herb, "Do you know how to get out?" Herb was confident and winked at Amelia with his starry eyes, "Follow me!" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Herb turned around and walked towards the electrical box, Amelia quickly followed him. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Herb passed the counter, he casually grabbed a knife and a glass of red wine that someone had just ordered. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He walked slowly to the location of the electrical box, drank the red wine in his hand in one gulp, and threw away the glass. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment the glass hit the ground and made a shattering sound, the lights in the entire cafe suddenly went out with a "pop"!</span></p></div>
