        <h1>Chapter 1843: A Sly Grin</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia abruptly retreated mid-sentence, unable to face the goodbye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her frail figure was a stark contrast to the typical robust pregnancy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James, unable to mask his concern, called out to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Amelia."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia slowed her pace at his shaky voice, expecting an invitation to leave with him, but it never came.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead, he told her, "I'll bring S back. Don't stay in Erebus; it's dangerous."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She nodded and kept walking towards the A-zone villa, unperturbed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James didn't stop her - he couldn't. He knew her safety was ensured once he left, thanks to an understanding with Matty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia paused, turned, and revealed, "S was around before your birth, then known as darkness. Matty's after it for killing my grandma. Use this to look into the Darkness and Matty feud."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stunned by the news, James was left in a daze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before he was even born, S was established, known then as Darkness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Master Davies claimed he set it up to build his power. Later, he found out Davies did it all for Ashley. If S was truly founded before his birth, it meant Davies had been lying to him from the start.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">But why? Why deceive him?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James was left reeling from the revelation when a helicopter swooped in, landing before him. A man in a suit stepped out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Cobra, you're off to Chiang Rai? I'll take you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James boarded the helicopter, suppressing his anger and regret.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He glanced back at Amelia, who was standing by the window in the villa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the helicopter took off, Amelia's tears started to fall uncontrollably.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She stepped out of the villa, looking up at the departing helicopter like an abandoned child.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Through her tear-blurred vision, she thought she saw James looking back at her from the helicopter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, it moved too fast and soon, she became a small dot among the trees.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only when she was out of sight did James avert his gaze and focused on the flight path.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matty had actually let him leave without any tricks. Whether it was out of boldness or part of a plan, James was determined to return with his team and seek revenge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Regardless of whether Master Davies was deceiving him, James would avenge every fallen member of S against the manipulators of Erebus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With hatred suppressing his pain of losing Amelia, James leaned back in the helicopter, staring ahead coldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matty, at the control end, got the message, 'S is coming back,' and he was thrilled. More prey in one place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He'd rigged James' chip with a fail-safe, a trap James couldn't defuse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if he brought S back, the chip would be their downfall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Amelia's departure, the war between Erebus and S was on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matty, having calculated everything, quickly left his console when he saw Amelia, who was brought back by the old butler.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Done," Amelia said emotionlessly, nodding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Take me to Emily."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now that they each had their tasks and their safety was guaranteed, they could split up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Got time now, let's roll," Matty said, walking past Amelia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Exiting the meeting room, a cunning smile appeared on his lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leaving the meeting, a sly grin spread on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He'd quieted the </span><span>Moores</span><span> with a 'life spared', no fear about Amelia meeting Emily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Better yet, he could use this to take out Brandon and Emily!</span></p></div>
