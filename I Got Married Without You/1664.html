        <h1>Chapter 1664 The sudden proposal</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sudden proposal left Eva feeling a bit confused and helpless. She asked Paul for some time to think it over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul glanced at the diamond ring on Eva's hand and noticed that she hadn't taken it off and given it back to him. It indicated that she was leaning towards him. So, he didn't push her further.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How long do you need to think?" he asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ryan will be discharged from the hospital tomorrow. Let me settle him back home, and then I'll give you a definite answer," Eva replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing that Eva was still perplexed, Paul guessed that she hadn't sorted out her thoughts yet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay, I'll go back to my country and wait for your answer."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva nodded. Paul stared at her for a while and suddenly reached out and hugged her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Initially, Eva wanted to push him away, but she hesitated when he embraced her with all his strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feeling that she didn't instinctively push him away like before, Paul felt a warm current flowing into his heart, making him feel sweet and content.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Eva, I hope your answer won't be a rejection," Paul said, then let go of her and smiled as he walked away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Watching his relaxed and carefree figure, Eva suddenly felt bewildered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She raised her hand and looked at the diamond ring...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Was Elsie telling the truth?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Should she trust Paul again?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Paul got into the car, he hugged Kate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom, if it weren't for you, I would probably remain single for the rest of my life."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing her son so happy, Kate knew that the misunderstanding had been cleared up, and she couldn't help but smile knowingly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kate was still not very satisfied with Eva, but compared to Elsie, she married Paul, not Eva.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"After you two get married, live your own lives. Don't bring Eva around me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you can speak up for me in front of Edith and bring her to me, that's fine too."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul, who was resting his chin on his hand, turned his head and smiled nonchalantly as he glanced at Kate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, you're helping me for Edith, huh..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Otherwise?" Kate raised an eyebrow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"With a son like you, what's worth helping?" Paul smirked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom, you always say one thing and mean another."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kate raised her hand and pinched his ear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You have to compensate for the collectibles your dad lost."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul, feeling a bit guilty, immediately put on a smiley face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom, on the day of my wedding, I will definitely bring Edith home."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing him say that, Kate released her grip on his ear and crossed her arms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's more like it..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After the extended Lincoln car left the hospital, a red car suddenly turned back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva in the ward was absent-minded. Ryan noticed and put down the book in his hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Eva, do you have something on your mind lately?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva has been feeling down recently, and even her smiles seem forced.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although today wasn't as gloomy as before, there was still a trace of worry in her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ryan had depression and had undergone a major surgery. He had to endure the immense pain caused by the nerves in his legs every day. He was already going through a tough time, and Eva didn't want to bring negative energy to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm fine. It's just that someone younger than me proposed to me, and I don't know if I should accept him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ryan was always smart, and he immediately thought of Paul. In his impression, Paul was quite a ladies' man, known for being a playboy. But after being with Eva, he seemed to have fewer scandals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you love him, then accept. If not, then reject," Ryan said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since Eva didn't want to say who it was, Ryan naturally pretended not to know. He was just analyzing from the perspective of a brother, hoping that she would marry the person she loved.</span></p></div>
