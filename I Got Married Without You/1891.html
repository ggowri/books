        <h1>Chapter 1891 Amelia treated Johnny differently</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Zack was mentioned, James's cold eyes were tinged with a haze of regret that seemed endless. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He remained still for a long time, until he managed to hide the pain in his eyes. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then he looked up and met Johnny's serious gaze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's the name of the person who looks like Zack?" Johnny asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Zenith," James nodded lightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I happened to have some business in my home country, so I thought I'd let you know," Johnny said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In fact, a phone call would have sufficed to inform Johnny about this matter, but Johnny seemed to have his own reasons for making the trip. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James, dressed in a dark coat and exuding a faint aura of melancholy, could easily see through Johnny's intentions. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was just that Johnny was not good at controlling his emotions and always acted on impulse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>During this period, Johnny had a strange dream. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He dreamt of Amelia stumbling and staggering towards him, and he caught her firmly, saying, "Alright, I'll take you away." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After this dream, Johnny sat by the bedside, staring at the desolate scenery outside the window, unable to forget it. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because of this dream, the heart that should have been put down was once again stirred.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, he lowered his gaze and looked at the intertwined fingers of the two people, which reminded him that it was just a dream, a dream that he had longed for.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you," James said, his heavy heart slowly retracting from the images in the snake pit. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he looked at Johnny again, he sensed that Johnny was thinking about something.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Following Johnny's gaze, he looked at his own hand holding Amelia's, and for a moment, he felt a hint of covetousness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Brook," a cold voice as icy as snow interrupted Johnny's thoughts. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He immediately snapped back to reality.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked up and met James's indifferent gaze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you for saving my wife and for coming all the way back to inform me," Johnny said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It was nothing, just a small favor," James replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Johnny finished speaking, he walked around the front of the car and opened the passenger door, intending to get in. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But James's indifferent voice slowly sounded in his ears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aren't you staying for dinner?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Johnny, who was holding onto the car door with one hand, gave him a disdainful look.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do I look like someone who doesn't have food to eat? Do I need to stay at your house for dinner?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well then, let me give you a big gift as a token of gratitude," Amelia said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Johnny's temper improved a bit, but he was still not very happy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"When I saved you, I must have been out of my mind. I won't save you again if it happens another time. </span><span>So</span><span> stop with all the thanks, it's annoying."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at Johnny's impatient expression, Amelia was taken aback. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He seemed indifferent, but what she wanted to thank him for was not just saving her, but also the drawer of food he had left for her. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that difficult environment, every apple and every glass of milk Johnny gave her was unforgettable. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia cherished this kindness in her heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Johnny got into the car, she sincerely said, "Thank you, Johnny."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man who had already sat in the car paused for a moment. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the next second, he pretended as if nothing had happened, fastened his seatbelt, and quickly started the car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When the car turned around and drove away, Johnny finally dared to openly look through the rearview mirror at the gradually shrinking figure...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't describe the feeling, but he felt empty inside. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Did he want to have her? Yes, he did. But she didn't belong to him, not even a glance. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the end, he could only describe it as helplessness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Johnny kept his feelings for Amelia hidden deep inside, restraining himself from crossing any boundaries. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James followed his lead and didn't mention anything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he could also see that Amelia treated Johnny differently, and this difference began with the drawer of food Johnny had left for her. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James saw on the surveillance footage that Amelia cried all night for Johnny and even held onto the apple he had left behind while sitting on the bed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, James knew that in Amelia's mind, there was only Johnny, the man who was willing to die for her. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Regardless of whether it was out of gratitude or not, at that moment, Johnny had become someone special to Amelia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This difference made James feel uncomfortable. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't know how he managed to get through those moments behind the surveillance footage, but fortunately, it was all in the past now. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James squeezed Amelia's hand and brought her back to reality.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wife, tomorrow, I'm going to Barcelona," James said, his eyes filled with a heavy emotion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're going to see Zenith?" Amelia asked, meeting James's gaze that was bathed in the light of dusk.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm going to see if Zack has come back," James replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zack was already dead and wouldn't come back, but if someone who looked exactly like him appeared, who wouldn't mistake him for Zack? </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia didn't shatter James's hope in his heart. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She simply said calmly, "I'll go with you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James's lips slightly parted, wanting to stop her, but Amelia continued, "If possible, the three of us should have another meal together, the one you cook, on the ship..."</span></p></div>
