        <h1>Chapter 1653 I don't want Paul or your money</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unaware of anyone outside, Eva lowered her head and asked the man lying on the hospital bed, "Ryan, what do you want to eat? I'll make it for you when I go back."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ryan, who had just undergone a major surgery, looked pale and weak, but he still softly responded to Eva, "Let Zoey go buy it, you don't have to keep running back and forth."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva had been tirelessly shuttling between the hospital and their living quarters for some time now. While wringing a towel dry, she quickly said, "You can't get used to the food here, so I'll cook for you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ryan wanted to persuade her, but Eva interrupted him gently, saying, "It's just making a meal, it's not tiring at all."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Was making a meal not tiring? Kate felt exhausted just thinking about it. Did Eva never get tired because she had been doing it since she was little? Kate's face darkened at the thought. She needed to change this habit of always thinking from Eva's perspective!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Eva busy, Paul understood and didn't bother her. He waited until she finished pouring the water and came out before approaching her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Eva."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Paul appear here surprised Eva. After standing still for a moment, she quickly lowered her head and walked around him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not wanting to be ignored, Paul hurriedly caught up with her and stopped her. "Eva, my mom has talked to you privately. I already know."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva had mentioned it to Amelia, so it wasn't surprising that Paul would find out too. But... when Eva glanced at Kate standing in the distance, why was his mother here too?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Confused, Eva saw Paul turn to the side and point at Kate. "I brought my mom here today specifically for her to apologize to you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Apologize?" Would Kate, a high-born lady from a wealthy family, apologize to her?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva didn't believe it, but Paul explained, "My mom slandered you first, so naturally she has to apologize."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After explaining, he turned back and desperately gestured to Kate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Reluctantly, Kate walked up to Eva, "I spoke too harshly before, Ms. Miller, you don't have to take it to heart."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Kate apologized, her tone and attitude still looked down on Eva. But it didn't matter to Eva, who replied, "It's okay."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva calmly dropped these words and wanted to go back to cooking. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing her turn around, Paul reached out to grab her wrist, but as soon as his fingers touched Eva's skin, she recoiled as if she had touched something dirty. She quickly pushed his hand away and took several steps back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul was stunned by her strong reaction. What had happened to Eva? Why was she resisting him like this? Was it because Kate's apology wasn't sincere enough?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking it was because of Kate, Paul elbowed her. "Mom, apologize more sincerely. </span><span>Don't just brush it off."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kate was filled with anger, but when she saw Paul's pleading eyes, she gritted her teeth and swallowed her anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suppressing her temper, she adjusted her posture and expression, intending to apologize. However, Eva refused her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mrs. Evans, you don't need to apologize to me. You're his mother, it's normal for you to worry about him, I understand."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kate, who thought Eva would take this opportunity to fight back, was also stunned. What did that mean?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva took out her wallet from her jeans pocket and handed Kate the black card she carried with her. "Mrs. Evans, this is the black card you gave me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon seeing the card, Paul finally realized that Kate had also used money to humiliate Eva. His anger, which had just subsided, resurfaced.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"According to what was said before, I accept that it represents giving up on Paul. If I don't accept, I'll return the card to you. Now, I'm returning the card to you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kate raised an eyebrow upon hearing this. She knew Eva was playing a game of cat and mouse. She had just condescended to come and apologize, but Eva immediately chose not to give up on Paul. Didn't that show how cunning she was?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Otherwise, if Eva didn't want to give up, why did she refuse Paul's advances? Wasn't she trying to make Paul blame her?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kate, who had been swayed by James's words, discarded all her wavering thoughts after seeing Eva's true colors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're returning the card to me, so you don't want to keep your nightclub anymore?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing Kate daringly threaten Eva in front of her, Paul immediately wanted to get angry, but Eva spoke first.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm returning the card to you because I don't want your money, and at the same time, I don't want Paul."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul's heart skipped a beat. She didn't want him?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Eva, what are you saying?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without even looking at him, Eva stared at Kate and calmly said, "Mrs. Evans, don't worry, I will never marry Paul in my lifetime."</span></p></div>
