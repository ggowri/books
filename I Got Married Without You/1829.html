        <h1>Chapter 1829 Let's make a deal</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing Amelia's name, James's silent heart began to beat rapidly, and a glimmer of light appeared in his dim eyes. "Her message?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you think Amelia is dead?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James's eyes changed rapidly, eventually showing a hint of suspicion. "If you want to negotiate with me using false information about her death, then leave."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emily and Brandon would not spare Amelia, and who would save her, and who could save her? </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't believe it, and Matty didn't rush to explain. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He gestured to Dylan with his cigarette-holding hand. "Show him the video."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dylan understood, took out his phone, and played the video sent by the photographer at the family reunion in front of James. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the video, Amelia was wearing a champagne-colored dress, standing under a pear tree, looking at the crowd, with the breeze gently lifting her skirt. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This video was taken tonight, and there's a time stamp on it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James couldn't hear Matty's words. His tear-filled eyes were fixed on the woman in the video. Her face, features, and expression had not changed. It seemed genuine, so... she wasn't dead, was she? </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James's eyes gradually turned red as he fought back tears, and his heart ached with each beat, even his palms hurt. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He reached out with trembling fingers to touch the screen, but he didn't have the strength. He tried several times, but his hand fell back down. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could only slowly look away from the video and towards Dylan, holding the phone. His eyes seemed to ask what was going on. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dylan, behind the heavy mask, looked at James's red eyes for a moment, feeling a little guilty, but he ignored his confusion and put away the phone, walking expressionlessly to Matty's side.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James's pleading eyes followed Dylan and then turned to Matty. "Tell me the truth, and I'll agree to your terms." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't even ask what the conditions were, but for Amelia, he was willing to agree to anything. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matty saw that James was also deeply in love with Amelia, but unfortunately... </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though Matty could empathize with James, they were in an adversarial relationship, and with the chip in his brain as the catalyst for Amelia's betrayal, so... Matty had to break them apart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matty looked at James and spoke calmly. "Brandon pushed her into the sea and then went back to save her." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matty's tone was casual, as if he were discussing an insignificant matter. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps his tone was too calm, and James found it hard to believe what he was saying. "How could Brandon save her? He was the one sent to kill Amelia. How could he save her?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It turned out that Amelia had told Brandon that she was his biological daughter before they fell into the sea. So that's how it was... </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia had told Brandon this secret in order to survive, but she didn't expect to be pushed into the sea... </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But no matter what, the result was that Brandon's conscience had not been completely extinguished, and he saved her. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This reason was reliable, and in an instant, James was filled with hope. It was as if everything had come back to life, giving him the motivation to live. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He smiled, and for him, as long as Amelia was alive, it was the most beautiful thing in </span><span>the world. In this moment, he even thanked Brandon for saving Amelia. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All his hatred dissipated in an instant. James lowered his eyelashes, and the tears in his eyes fell onto the back of his hand. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the release of his emotions, James's tense nerves relaxed at that moment. He leaned against the wall, and his rigid body softened. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've told you that Amelia is alive. Now, let's hear my terms," Matty's aged voice fell on James's ears, causing him to slowly suppress his emotions. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What are your conditions?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he looked up again, his sharp eyes were now cold and clear. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matty raised an eyebrow slightly. "Do you want to see her?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James thought that Amelia had fallen into the hands of 1-1. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His heart, which had just relaxed, tightened again, but he forcibly stabilized his mind and looked at Matty, who was motionless. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What do you think?" James's indifferent eyes seemed to mock Matty's question. Matty's deliberate question was just a prelude to what he was about to say. "Tomorrow, I will release you and restore your 2-9 status. At that time, I will let you meet Amelia." Upon hearing this, James's confusion deepened. "Why do you want to restore my status?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What did the man with the full-face mask want to do?</span></p></div>
