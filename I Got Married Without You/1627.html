        <h1>Chapter 1627 Crazy for love</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva's mind was still fuzzy, but her body had experienced some passion, so she naturally felt something. As she felt the tingling sensation in her ears, she lowered her eyelashes slightly, seemingly pondering how to respond, but her mind was blank.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though the excitement had faded, her body nestled in the man's embrace still trembled slightly, her face flushed and difficult to fade, and her eyes were unfocused.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Eva in this state, Paul knew exactly how she felt, but he pretended not to notice and hugged Eva's waist tightly, making her lie on top of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It seems like you didn't have a good experience, let's do it again."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He enjoyed having her on top, but it was obviously impossible with a drunk Eva.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul held onto her waist, kissed her for a while, then lifted Eva, who was lying in the bathtub, and casually grabbed a towel to wrap her up before carrying her out of the bathroom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Paul pressed Eva onto the soft bed once again, his energetic self lightly grabbed her cheek, making her dazedly open her eyes and look at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you still recognize who I am now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva raised her wandering eyes and stared at the man in front of her, not saying whether she recognized him or not, just looking at him foolishly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul released his grip on her jaw, leaned over her, and gently opened her legs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Eva, remember, I am Paul."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying this, he suddenly lowered his head and captured Eva's lips, devouring her like a wild beast hunting its prey, leaving Eva with no choice but to endure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul was always skilled in this aspect, and in no time, Eva once again experienced the surge of pleasure, unable to stop her trembling body being pinned down by the man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She clung to Paul's neck like an injured rabbit, feeling a bit panicked but having no choice but to hold on tight to her lifeline in front of her...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a little effort, he could pull her out of the abyss, but if he didn't use force, she would feel like dying. This extreme experience of tugging and pulling made Eva completely surrender...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he was also like flying a kite, holding the string that bound her. Sometimes he tightened it forcefully, and other times he loosened it gently, tormenting her until she responded. Only then did he use one hand to hold her wrist and place it above her head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He leaned down, gently rubbing Eva's neck, "Eva, relax..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva couldn't hear what he said, but instinctively released the pressure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul knew that he had trained Eva well. Once she took control, he would be the one to fall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And indeed, every time like this, Paul wished he could die on top of Eva.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, unable to bear it anymore, he murmured, "Eva, do you know that I love you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He loved her and was willing to be controlled by her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He loved her and wanted to give everything for her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With great tenderness and affection, he kissed the trembling woman beneath him again and again, "I must marry you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wanted to marry her and would not break his promise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Driven by alcohol, Eva, with teary and hazy eyes, looked at the muscular man in front of her. She was somewhat unclear in her consciousness, but she knew who he was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She reached out her fair and delicate hand and stroked his face covered in sweat, "Paul, you've said before that you would marry me, but you always forgot afterwards..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he was in high spirits, he would whisper in her ear, "Eva, let's get married." Eva </span><span>didn't know how to respond, and every time she would lower her head. She didn't know what Paul was thinking. He would finish with her, put on his pants, and act like nothing happened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking of this, Eva felt a bit disappointed and lowered her eyelashes. Was this all just a dream? To make up for the past, she would hear Paul say these things and do these things...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul held her soft waist with his hand and tightly embraced the fragile and boneless Eva, then lowered his head to gently kiss her forehead, "I'm sorry."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought her silence meant she didn't agree, so he didn't take it seriously. After all, at that time, they were just playing around and never thought about giving each other their true hearts. But when reminiscing about the past, these hurtful details would always be magnified.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking it was a dream, Eva didn't pay attention to Paul's apology. She just held onto Paul's neck again and eagerly responded to his impact. "In my dreams, don't say you want to marry me anymore. I won't marry anyone..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul's body stiffened. So she thought she was dreaming, no wonder she always stared at him foolishly. Thinking of this, Paul sneered. She was already drunk, so he taking advantage was nothing out of the ordinary.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His expression darkened, but Eva, driven by desire, looked at the bold and stunning woman in his arms. Paul, who was already driven by lust, tore away the vine that bound his heart and shamelessly claimed Eva.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So she thought it was a dream? Then he would do it again and again until she was sober. He didn't believe she would keep thinking it was a dream!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That night, Paul went crazy, and Eva went crazy too. Two mad people together not only disturbed the tranquility of the night but also broke down the barriers between two hearts that were far apart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They sank for each other and were also trapped by each other...</span></p></div>
