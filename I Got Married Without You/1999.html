        <h1>Chapter 1999 Our Lives Are Intertwined</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In despair, Amelia raised her gaze and stared into the distance. "No. I'm not going anywhere. He and I will stay here until I freeze to death. Otherwise, no one can separate us."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing this, everyone became anxious and gathered to dissuade her from taking her own life, but she would not change her mind. Determined and stubborn, she clutched James in her arms, sitting in the snow and awaiting her demise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Alexander who took hold of Amelia's hand, firmly pressing her palm and drawing her attention to himself. "Mom, I understand how much you love Father and how difficult it is to accept his passing, but I have already lost him and can't bear to lose you too. Please don't commit suicide..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia glanced slowly at Alexander. At the sight of his face, which looked exactly like James', she broke into a pretty smile.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I have long been prepared for your father's death. Now that he is truly gone, I will naturally kill myself. You know, my life is intertwined with his. No one can prevent it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the past, Alexander believed James loved his Amelia more. It was not until this moment that he realized that her affection was equal to James'. However, Alexander could not lose both his parents on the day of his coming-of-age ceremony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After slowly approaching Amelia, he opened his arms and embraced her. "Mom, Father mentioned that he wished to see me get married and have children. Now, he hasn't witnessed it. Can you take his place and wait for me to complete these before your passing?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Amelia agreed, Alexander would never marry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But how could Amelia, who had already made up her mind, give up her determination to pursue James because of an unfulfilled wish? Therefore, even if the person in front of her was her son, she remained unmoved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing her resolute look, Alexander extremely humbly begged her, whose eyes were already indifferent. "Mom, for my sake, please stay with me for a while longer, okay?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia still didn't react. Alexander seemed to be suddenly stimulated. His eyes were bloodshot. He grabbed her hand and yelled hysterically, "Today is my birthday. My father is dead. Mom, do you want me to watch you die in front of me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The resounding noise was even more piercing than his previous slap, reverberating through the sky and leaving Amelia in a dilemma. Seated in the snow, she wept quietly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought, "If I take my own life, I will bring sorrow to my son. Otherwise, I will be sorry for my husband. James, tell me, in your absence, what should I do?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite Amelia's reluctance, Alexander pried open her tightly clasped hands from around James' body and proceeded to take it from her forcibly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Frowning, Alexander shouted, "Dylan, please take my mother home!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander, who had just reached adulthood, seemed to have matured overnight and took on all the responsibilities. With the help of Maxwell, he carried James' body on his back and staggered down the mountain in the heavy snow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While others were willing to lend a hand, Alexander was determined to do it alone, reminiscent of the way James had carried him as a child, through the final stretch of a snowy night.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a slow procession, everyone trailed behind Alexander, their cell phone lights illuminating the path ahead, guiding him homeward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dylan held Amelia's hand and stood there, fixing his eyes on his poor sister with tears in his eyes and waiting for her to leave and take her back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Besides, there was Johnny, who had rushed eagerly for the coming-of-age ceremony. Before giving the gift to Alexander, he received the news of James' death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite learning of the chip in James' brain and the possibility of his sudden demise, Johnny didn't expect that this day would arrive so soon. James perished in such a hurry without leaving a word.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Johnny sighed at the impermanence of the world. Meanwhile, through gaps in the distant trees, he watched Amelia sitting on the ground, unwilling to rise from under the falling snow.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a long while before Johnny stepped on the deep snow, crossed the forest trees, and appeared in front of Amelia. Without saying anything, he simply handed a rose to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at the pink rose that was still blooming brightly even in winter, Amelia could no longer hold back. She raised her hands, covered her cheeks, and burst into tears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She screamed inwardly, "James, you liar! You've promised to accompany me forever upon your return. Why are you gone first? Why did you leave me alone? Why can't I even end my life? Why?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Amelia couldn't utter a single word. Her attempts to release her grief only intensified her trembling. Eventually, she crumpled into the snow like a dead wood, unable to stem the tide of tears streaming endlessly from her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The loss of a loved one proved to be such a heart-wrenching pain. Back then, after her passing, James must have suffered such sorrow that was worse than death. So, it was fair that they both died once.&#8203;</span></p></div>
