        <h1>Chapter 2002 Four Regrets</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Amelia was dying, her mind was consumed by the love that James had concealed from her over those five years.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She woke up, only to find herself being tightly held by his strong arms. If it wasn't affection, what else could it be?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At dinner on the weekend, she noticed him sitting across the table, occasionally peeking at her out of the corner of his eye. What could explain his behavior other than a long-term infatuation?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After having sex with her, James picked her up on his body. Then, he raised his fingers and placed them on her back, coaxing her to sleep as if she were a child.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James' affection manifested in the minutiae. It was difficult to discern the nature of his devotion. Only he comprehended the extent of his restraint in those moments and the depth of his love for her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia could no longer open her eyes. It was as if her soul had been taken from her body, and she had lost the strength to rise and take one last look at the world.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She fumbled for the phone in her pocket and randomly dialed a number. Coincidentally, it was Eva.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva aged over the years. Her once clear voice had now become slightly muffled compared to her youth. "Amelia, in two days, when my grandchild is born, I will come to visit you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia felt lucky to be able to hear Eva's voice at the last moment of her life. However, somehow, she cried uncontrollably, tears streaming down her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Eva, I miss him so much that I have to find him in advance. Help me say sorry to Alexander. I can't wait until he gets married."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the other end of the phone, Eva burst into tears upon hearing this request. Yet, she understood that Amelia had persisted for so many years only because, as a mother, she couldn't disregard Alexander. Otherwise, Amelia would have ended her own life long ago, following James' death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Some time ago, Eva learned that Amelia's health was already failing. Despite their desire to save her, the doctors shook their heads and concluded there was no hope after examining her. Since Amelia proposed to find James, even Eva intended to stop her, yet she couldn't.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Amelia, if you have anything else you want to say to him, just let me know. I'll relay everything to him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia contemplated for a moment. Besides offering an apology, she couldn't think of anything else. Lacking the energy for further conversation, she replied, "Eva, in our next life, I'll be your best friend once more." With a sudden loss of grip, the phone slipped from her hand, and she couldn't discern whether Eva's screams came from the other end.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In her final moments, Amelia beheld James standing amidst the mist, his hand outstretched towards her, whispering, "Amelia, I've waited for you for so long. You're finally here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Staring at his youthful appearance, she couldn't help but smile, "Honey, you are still better-looking in your youth."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James took her hand firmly in his and pressed it to his palm while his other hand brushed tenderly against her nose. "Honey, you too."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia caught a glance at herself in James' deep eyes. She had no wrinkles or grey hair, and her skin was as smooth as ever. Therefore, she beamed with joy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She took James' arm and followed him into the mist. Perhaps it was a journey to the next life or merely a fantasy glimpsed in the moments before one's passing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anyway, before closing her eyes, she noticed two messages. One read: [I miss you.] The other read: [I have a stomachache. Come to see me.]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, James, curling up on the sofa, complained of a stomachache and asked her, "Which message brought you here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia sat halfway on the sofa, her gaze fixed on James' pallid lips, and said softly, "I am here because you miss me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James seized her wrist, drew her closer to him, and gently cupped her chin with his fingers. Tilting his head up slightly, he asked her arrogantly, "I miss you. Do you miss me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Staring at him, who loved her deeply, Amelia nodded gently. "Yes. James, I miss you very much. When you were not around, I thought about you every day."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a moment of silence, James suddenly revealed a warm smile. He then put his arms around her waist, letting her bury herself in his arms, and whispered in her ear, "If you miss me, follow me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia went away with James, leaving nothing else but an apology to Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>During the years when Alexander kept Amelia for maternal love, she finally exhausted all her vitality. She was gone in a hurry without even having time to listen to James' following words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander looked at the two tombstones buried side by side, wondering, "If I had married earlier, would my mother be able to see me start a family?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He continued to procrastinate, only awakening to reality after Amelia's passing. Yet, most of the things in this world were regrettable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In this lifetime, he had four regrets, which were his powerlessness in the face of James' death, his inability to have Amelia witness his marriage, his rejection of Beth in a bid to capture Amelia's attention, and his incapacity to end his own life after his parents' decease, burdened as he was, still in his twenties, with the responsibilities left by James.</span></p></div>
