        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The smile of the man was somewhat detached from the secular world, which inadvertently infected Amelia and also influenced James. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The excitement in James' heart to meet Zack calmed down because of this smile. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James, who never casually drinks outside, picked up a colorful glass and placed it by his lips, taking a sip. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The faint aroma of tea quickly spread from his lips and teeth, revealing a unique charm. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He remained silent for a few moments, then looked at Zenith and said, "You do look like him, but you are not him." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But you are not him" represents that in James' mind, no one can replace Zack. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zack was unique, and no matter how similar someone might be, they could never become him. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This sentence was comforting for Zenith: "The fact that you can distinguish between us shows that Zack is also important to you. This kind of friendship, where we consider each other's feelings, is very rare and precious." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James lowered his eyelashes, concealing the sadness in his eyes, "I also wished you were him, but when I saw you, I knew it was just wishful thinking." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zenith, a man filled with remorse, thought for a moment and comforted him, "Mr. Shawn, if you don't mind, you can treat me as him. I am willing to replace him and continue to serve you." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He would treat him as a pitiful younger brother and make some compensation. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, he alone enjoyed the benefits of the family while his younger brother walked towards death in the storm. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This injustice must be rectified. The title "Mr. Shawn" fell on James' ears, undoubtedly bringing back the departed Zack. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stared at Zenith's face and asked softly, "What did you just call me?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zenith put down his teacup, slightly turned his face, and raised his eyebrows at him, "Mr. Shawn." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James was taken aback, as if he saw the former Zack through Zenith's face. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that time, after Zack fired his last shot, he put the gun on his shoulder and raised his eyebrows, tilting his chin. "Mr. Shawn, I'm the first one to finish shooting today. Shouldn't you reward me with some pocket money?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shoot thirty more rounds, and I'll give you a hundred thousand dollars." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Only a hundred thousand? You're so stingy." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, will you shoot or not?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course, I'll shoot. A hundred thousand is still money!" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That carefree young man carried his gun and continued to snipe for the sake of a hundred thousand dollars. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sometimes, James would also wonder if Zack would still be alive if he hadn't followed him. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked at Zenith, lost in thought, but Zenith pulled him out of his painful past, saying, "Mr. Shawn, the past is gone. Let it go." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James focused on Zenith, slowly collecting his thoughts, picked up his teacup, took another sip, and didn't know what to say. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They sat quietly for a while, and Zenith's gaze shifted to Amelia. "Miss, I've noticed that you've been wanting to say something to me. Is there something you want to tell me?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia didn't really have anything to say to him, she just looked at that face that looked exactly like Zack's and felt a bit excited. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But since Zenith asked, she made a hypothetical suggestion, "Do you want to try the food my husband cooks?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After asking, she regretted it. He wasn't Zack, and it was unfair to expect him to fill Zack's shoes. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Zenith smiled and said, "I suppose your husband's cooking isn't very good?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he said this, his tone was different from Zack's, but he was just like Zack in assuming that James couldn't cook.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia, who felt that they were quite similar in some aspects, understood why Gigi would mistake Zenith for Zack. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feeling that the other person was as friendly as Zack, she relaxed her tense body and smiled at Zenith, "It's not that it's inedible, it's just terribly bad." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zenith's gaze shifted to James, seeing him in his immaculate suit, and couldn't help but playfully think, "Then I really want to see how bad Mr. Shawn's cooking is." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James had to put aside his dignity, and with a twinkle in his eyes, he replied, "If you don't mind, I'll borrow your kitchen." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zenith naturally didn't mind and then led James to the kitchen. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Watching James struggle to distinguish between salt and sugar, Zenith laughed, "I never expected someone as distinguished as you to be willing to cook for Zack." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James, holding the salt shaker and mistaking it for sugar, poured several </span><span>spoonfuls</span><span> into the pot, while replying to Zenith, "I'm sorry, but the last dinner wasn't for him." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought of Zack sitting at the dining table on the deck, forcing himself to finish all the food, even though he didn't want to eat it because it tasted terrible. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was quite amusing. But unfortunately, that kind of Zack would never come back. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at James' desolate profile, Zenith said warmly, "I will eat the food you cooked for him on his behalf." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James remained silent for a few seconds, nodded lightly, and continued to sprinkle 'sugar' into the pot with all his might.</span></p></div>
