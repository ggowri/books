        <h1>Chapter 1589 The taste of victory</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stella couldn't understand. Stiffly, she walked up to Karen, asking her, "Aunt, what are you laughing about?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Karen didn't hide her smile at all. Instead, she raised her hand and gently touched Stella's hair, saying, "I'm laughing because my little Stella has finally escaped this demon."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She seemed to pity Stella very much. With gentle movements, she stroked Stella's cheek and said, "You&rsquo;ve been through hell because of Erin all these years, and I really feel sorry for you. So when he died, even though it pained me too, I still felt happy for you. After all, your escape from nightmares matters more...."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Karen was very kind to Stella, giving her money and love without reservation. Right after Stella joined the Simpson family, Karen transferred all the money that Thomas had given her to Stella&rsquo;s account and even gave her several houses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Karen treated Erin well too, in Stella's eyes. She always cared for him and protected him, even when Erin treated her with harsh words and violence. Karen had no complaints and even showed love for Erin. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But when Stella wasn&rsquo;t there, Erin would often angrily accuse Karen of being two-faced. Without waiting for Karen to explain, Thomas would slap Erin, and then Erin would say nothing, just kick the chair and leave the Simpson family...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Many times, when the three of them had conflicts, Stella would be upstairs, and if she accidentally saw them, Karen would use her eyes to signal her to leave. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stella felt like she was just a guest, and it was better not to get involved in their family affairs. So she would obediently keep her distance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As their conflicts intensified, Stella developed a habit of not getting close or eavesdropping, and she never knew the reasons behind their fights.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But in Stella's impression, Karen was indeed a very gentle and kind stepmother. At least, she never said anything bad about Erin in front of her. She always praised the child for being smart. Even with the servants around her, she never said anything horrible about him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stella thought that maybe this good person was genuinely happy for her, just like Andrew. After all, Karen and Andrew were her relatives, they had blood ties, and naturally, they loved her more than Erin, who had hurt them...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stella thought about it and didn't ask any more questions. She just looked away and glanced at the urn that had been placed in the black car. Erin had turned to ashes, and even with all the grievances, it was now over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, strange feelings surged within her heart as Stella touched her chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She felt suffocated, as if all the hatred she held toward Erin was gone. Moreover, it felt like she had lost the purpose of being. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Stella couldn&rsquo;t hold back these strange feelings, she could only let them consume her and drag herself into the abyss, into hell...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Karen saw that Stella didn't suspect anything further, so she slowly put away her smile. The taste of victory was reflected in her eyes...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Erin was finally dead. There would be no one to belittle her, no one to point fingers at her as a homewrecker, and no one to oppose her. And her son would be able to inherit the Simpson family without any competition.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From now on, as an uneducated, uncultured, and immoral woman who came from a small county town, she could sit firmly in Mrs. Simpson's position. No one would expose her past, and no one would look down on her arrogantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking of Erin, Karen stared coldly at the small black urn. She sneered to herself that no matter how stubborn or capable he was, he still turned into ashes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a mocking laugh, Karen greeted Stella and got into the car. As the black window rolled up, Karen and Mike exchanged a glance, and then both of them grinned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Erin was dead, and no one would know what Karen had done behind the scenes, including Erin himself. In this world, only she knew the schemes she had set up back then, and she would never be foolish enough to reveal her secrets to the public.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Karen thought about this while touching Erin's urn, and laughed heartily, feeling a joy she had never experienced before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had been hoping for his death to come for many years, and now that he was finally dead, she was overjoyed.</span></p></div>
