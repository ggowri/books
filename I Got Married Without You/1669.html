        <h1>Chapter 1669 The woman at the airport</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva hurriedly returned to Arcadia and saw Paul at the airport, holding a bouquet of flowers and handing it to a beautiful and well-built woman. Her footsteps slowly came to a halt as the bustling airport faded from her sight, leaving only the two of them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She saw the woman, after receiving the bouquet of flowers, suddenly tiptoe and kiss Paul on the cheek, then cover her mouth and quickly run away. Meanwhile, Paul stood still for two seconds, then turned around and walked away quickly. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the two figures disappeared from her sight, Eva's world was left in darkness. She realized that even without Elsie, Paul would still have other women in his life. The barrier between them was never Elsie, but the sense of security he couldn't provide and the trust that would always be hindered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva wanted to give her child a home where the father was faithful and the mother could trust. But it seemed that both she and Paul couldn't do that. She returned home in a daze, sat blankly for a while, then picked up her phone and called the obstetrician she had known before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mandy had just come in with milk when she heard the news that Eva was going to have an abortion. She was so shocked that her hand trembled, almost spilling the milk from the tray.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After hanging up the phone, Eva noticed that Mandy had heard and frowned slightly, "Mandy, don't tell anyone..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mandy was confused, "Eva, if you're pregnant, why would you want to have an abortion?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva didn't answer Mandy, she just lifted the covers and fell onto the bed, physically and mentally exhausted, feeling very tired.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing her exhaustion, Mandy suppressed her many questions and left quietly, putting down what she was holding and walking out of the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul had been waiting at the airport for a long time but didn't see Eva. He quickly called Mandy, "Mandy, you said Eva booked an 11 o'clock flight, why didn't you see her?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mandy, who had just left the room, realized she forgot to tell Paul, "Eva has already come back and she's at home."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva still had Paul blocked on her phone. Paul could only get her itinerary information from Mandy. Now that he heard she had already returned, his worried heart relaxed and he quickly turned around and ran outside the airport.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By the time he arrived, Eva was already asleep. She must have been too tired because </span><span>she was sleeping deeply. He sat in the room for a long time and she didn't wake up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul thought it was okay, he wanted her to rest peacefully and give her answer tomorrow. He got up, quietly left the room, and as soon as he walked out, he saw Mandy pacing anxiously outside the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mandy, what's wrong?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mandy stopped and looked at Paul, struggling to speak. "Mandy, just tell me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I... I was just worried about Eva, so I stayed outside the door..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mandy had been hired by Eva as a nanny during her difficult three years. Mandy took care of her and their relationship grew closer. Eva often treated her like a mother, and Mandy saw Eva as her own child.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry, she's just tired. She'll be fine after a good sleep."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul reassured Mandy and occasionally went in to check on Eva before going downstairs. There was something urgent at the company that he had to deal with.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Watching his tall figure leave, Mandy felt troubled. The next morning, Eva left early and didn't give Mandy a chance to persuade her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Holding her phone, Mandy was torn between whether or not to call Paul.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva arrived at the hospital and cooperated with the doctor for all the preoperative examinations before lying on the operating table.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before the surgery, Eva lifted her hand and touched her flat belly again...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Forgive me, my child. I don't want you to be born as a child without a father. She had experienced the pain of not having parents, and even though her child would still have a mother, without a father, there would be a crucial love missing in their life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Miller, we're going to administer anesthesia..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The doctor's words reached Eva's ears, and she slowly lowered her hand from her belly...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the anesthesia was about to enter her body, the door of the operating room was kicked open--</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul entered with a cold expression, quickly grabbing the anesthetist's hand and forcefully pushing him away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sir, this is the operating room, please leave!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get lost--"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The nurse who spoke was startled, and the other doctors wanted to call security, but Paul's bodyguard drove them out of the operating room.</span></p></div>
