        <h1>Chapter 1953 Being Slapped and Scolded</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Therefore, Johnny was attracted to Amelia's good looks. As they got to know each other, she gradually captured his heart. It was undeniably love. He cared for her deeply and thus wished her nothing but the best.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For example, after surviving the challenges of childbirth, Amelia led a happy life with James and Alexander. Johnny was genuinely glad for her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite occasionally competing with James, Johnny had no intention of destroying Amelia's marriage. The very reason he could never express his love for her was precisely because he had never entertained such an idea.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After burying the unspoken affection deep within his heart, Johnny lifted the wine glass, raised his eyebrows, and chuckled at Dylan, "I simply have a preference for good-looking girls. Mr. Lawrence, if you happen to come across a lady more beautiful than Amelia, do remember to introduce her to me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Johnny disguised his feelings well. Dylan gazed at him for an extended period but failed to discern any hints. So, he nodded. "No problem. Mr. Brook, your expectations are quite high, making it a bit difficult. However, when there is someone suitable, I will promptly recommend her to you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a smile, Johnny lifted the wine glass next to him and clinked it with Dylan's. "Apart from the lovely ladies, leave me some promising projects. Otherwise, once the Evans Group dominates the market, the Lawrence family will be left in the dust."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dylan said, "I don't mind, and it's none of your business." This further irritated Johnny, leading him to curse once more. As their argument continued, a loud slap reverberated through the restaurant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Immediately afterward, a woman fell to the floor and couldn't get up for a long time. "Michelle, I'm telling you, I can date as many women as I please and even beat you up at will. Don't assume that you can control me just because you are an adopted daughter of the Lawrence family."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dylan was not interested at first. Yet, upon hearing Michelle's name, he turned around suddenly and saw Michelle rising with the help of a chair in front of everyone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With her swollen cheek, she stood up straight and went forward to grab Alan's arm. "If you have anything to say, let's talk about it when we get home. Don't make a scene outside. It will have a bad influence."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Regardless of the consequences, Alan shook her hand away and prodded her nose with his index finger. "I'm warning you, from now on, take good care of the children at home, and don't trouble me, or I'll beat you to death!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying these harsh words, Alan kicked the chair away and left. Michelle endured the humiliation and waved when the waiter came over to comfort her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite being slapped and scolded by Alan in public, she remained calm and restrained and stooped to retrieve the chair that Alan had forcefully knocked over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Michelle put the chair in place and paid the bill. She was about to depart, only to find Dylan sitting in the corner. Actually, when Dylan called his adopted sisters over for a blind date, Michelle was aware of his presence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was not surprising that they would face each other, but she believed that Dylan would lose interest after a mere glance. After all, since her marriage, he had barely spoken to her and would always take a detour when they crossed paths. Unexpectedly, he was now staring at her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The dim light blurred his eyes and prevented Michelle from seeing them clearly. She couldn't figure out what he was thinking at the moment. Under his intent gaze, she pushed open the door of the restaurant and walked away quickly with her head down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Noticing that Dylan fixed his eyes on the beaten woman, Johnny couldn't help but ask, "Since you know her, why don't you go over and help her?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After watching Michelle's car speed past the window, Dylan withdrew his deep eyes, grabbed the wine glass from the table, and downed its contents in one gulp. "We are not familiar with each other. Why should I lend a hand to her?"</span></p></div>
