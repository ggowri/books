        <h1>Chapter 1612 Amelia came to save Stella</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Stella felt suffocated, she heard a series of urgent knocks on the door outside. Knock after knock, pounding incessantly... Stella didn't want to deal with it, but she faintly heard Amelia's anxious voice...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stella, open the door!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia and Eva had visited Stella many times after learning about Karen's situation, but Stella had always sent them away with the excuse of "I'm fine." Stella acted like a normal person, going to work every day and coming home on time, making them believe that she could get through it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But tonight, Amelia couldn't sleep. She was restless and worried, thinking about Stella's experiences. She couldn't shake the feeling that what Stella had gone through wasn't just a normal annoyance, but being used by loved ones since childhood and then killing her beloved herself. How could she possibly handle all of that?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was afraid that Stella was pretending to be fine on the surface but secretly devouring all the pain alone. She feared that, in the end, Stella wouldn't be able to bear it and might do something foolish. </span><span>So</span><span> she quickly got out of bed, threw on some clothes, and went to find Stella.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James also came. He leaned back in the car seat, his face slightly turned, gazing at the knocking Amelia. She knocked for a while, but the door still hadn't opened. Under her stunning face, a hint of unease could be seen...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He raised his slender finger, about to get out of the car and push the door open, when the door opened. Stella, soaked and dripping wet, appeared under the streetlight. Her face was pale, devoid of color, as if she had just experienced a life-or-death battle. She looked sickly...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stella came out wrapped in a towel. James had some doubts, but he didn't delve into it. He simply looked away, not glancing at her, and stared straight ahead at the car...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia saw that Stella finally opened the door and quickly reached out to hold her hand. "Stella, you look so pale, are you sick?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stella had initially thought about dying, but she realized that there were still many things left unsaid. At the very least, she needed to let the people who loved her know not to worry about her, instead of silently leaving like this. </span><span>So</span><span> she got out of the bathtub...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She held Amelia's hand and smiled, shaking her head. "I was just taking a bath in the bathroom. I probably soaked my face too long..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After speaking, she patted Amelia's hand. "I'm fine, don't worry."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia couldn't help but worry. "You didn't open the door for so long, I thought..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stella smirked. "You didn't think I would do something foolish, did you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia stared into Stella's eyes, not saying a word, but her expression gave a response.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing that, Stella couldn't help but raise the corner of her lips and laughed. "Silly, do you really think I would do something foolish over such a small matter?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stella's apparent ease and indifference made it difficult for Amelia to discern the truth. She could only open her arms and give her a hug.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stella, if you can't handle it, come to me or Eva. We will always be by your side, </span><span>never leaving..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia's embrace was always warm and comforting. Whenever she leaned on her shoulder, it was easy to be healed. But this time, Stella couldn't feel it. Her whole body was cold, making her feel like she was in the Arctic. Even Amelia couldn't melt her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stella's inner self was already in hell, enveloped in darkness. No one could save her, not even light. In secret, she was already crawling in the darkness, yet she still wore a mask of nonchalance on her face and patted Amelia's back, pretending everything was fine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry, I'll be fine. If something happens, I would have already come to you and Eva to pour my heart out..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While comforting Amelia, she glanced at the man sitting in the luxury car. She knew Mr. Evans had come for Amelia, appearing here in the middle of the night. She quickly let go of Amelia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, you've seen me. I'm not in trouble and I'm doing just fine. So go home and get some sleep, don't keep your husband waiting..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they parted, she teased Amelia, just like before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia sighed with relief at seeing Stella like this, but she still worried. "Okay, let me tell James and ask him to go back first. Tonight, I'll stay with you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stella was startled when she heard that and quickly stopped Amelia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you stay here for the night, he will level this house..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He wouldn't dare."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He would!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia wanted to say something else, but Stella had already pushed her towards the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You should go back quickly and stop bothering me. I need to sleep..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stella sent Amelia away and closed the door. Leaning against it, she let her body go weak, sliding down to the floor. The room only had a dimly lit small lamp, casting a flickering light on her pale face. She was thinking about nothing, feeling that everything in the world had become meaningless. Yet, even though there were still many people who loved her, why couldn't she feel it anymore?</span></p></div>
