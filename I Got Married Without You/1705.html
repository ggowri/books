        <h1>Chapter 1705 Old pictures</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia noticed Dylan disappearing into the study and quickly whispered to Neil, "Neil, Dylan has been testing us. Be careful." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rubbing his wrist, Neil shrugged it off, "People like him enjoy doing this. The more cautious you are, the more suspicious he becomes. Relax." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Neil had more experience with the aristocratic families he encountered during his project surveys than Amelia did. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia followed his lead, letting go of her tension and started examining the house. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The architecture was simple, as if it belonged to an ordinary wealthy family. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The only thing that seemed unique were the vintage photos on the walls. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those photos looked old and each one was only half intact. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was as if back then, she misunderstood Ryan and cut off the half that belonged to him, leaving only her and Eva. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man in those photos resembled Dylan, and judging by their age, that man should be Matty. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So the owner of this house was Matty's first love, and the one who cut the photos must be Dylan's first love. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia didn't understand why only Matty's photos were left in her own house, while hers were cut off. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Confused, she had a puzzled look on her face when Neil whispered in her ear, "Let me tell you a secret, Dylan just said his grandmother passed away, but he lied to you." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia raised her eyebrows in surprise, "His grandmother didn't pass away?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Neil shook his head, "His grandmother did pass away, but she's not his real grandmother. His grandmother is someone else, but I don't know who." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia: "...So you're basically saying nothing." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Neil shrugged, "Isn't that shocking enough?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia rolled her eyes at him, "You don't even know who Dylan's real grandmother is, and you dare say it's shocking." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Neil scratched his head, "I vaguely remember my master mentioning it, but I was playing a game at that time, so I didn't pay much attention..." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Skender always reviewed every project Aaron took on, so he thoroughly investigated every party involved in the project. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aaron was skilled at digging up information. He could uncover not only family secrets but also trivial old stories. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that time, Aaron used to tell Neil the stories behind each party, but Neil was too focused on gaming. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Footsteps came from upstairs. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Miss Clark, could you come up? My grandfather said he only wants to see you alone." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia and Neil exchanged glances. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I usually need an assistant to take notes during style discussions with the project parties." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dylan rested one hand on the railing of the escalator, slightly tilting his head to look at Amelia, who was looking up at him. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Miss Clark, it's best to follow my grandfather's request." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a gentle statement, but there was a hint of authority in his words. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was the inherent pressure that came from a scion of an aristocratic family. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After hesitating for two seconds, Amelia sat on the couch, opened her toolbox, took out her notebook, and walked upstairs. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Watching Amelia go upstairs alone to meet the project party, Neil felt anxious. If something went wrong, would James sacrifice him?</span></p></div>
