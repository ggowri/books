        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright." Paul slapped his thigh and stood up from the single sofa. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I came here to take care of you instead of Eva, and I ended up being kicked out." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul's complaints not only didn't earn him a word of persuasion, but also a command to "close the door."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a dark face, Paul closed the door. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He gritted his teeth and took out his phone, video calling Eva, and vented his anger at James's heartless actions! </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia in the hospital room couldn't help but smile as she watched Paul leave grumbling. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're too harsh on Paul, aren't you?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who asked him to have no sense?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James didn't care and replied, causing Andrew to call in a doctor. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The doctor quickly treated James's bleeding wound and immediately left with the nurse. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once the room door closed, James released his grip on Amelia's fingers and patted the empty space beside him. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come sit here." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Compared to the coldness he showed towards the doctor earlier, his calm voice now carried a hint of indulgence. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia smiled and moved to the side, took off her shoes, and lay down with James's gentle support. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Using his uninjured shoulder, James reached over Amelia's head and embraced her petite body. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He slightly turned his other injured shoulder, looking down at the woman in his arms. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The divorce agreement was forced, I never wanted to divorce you." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I know." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No matter when or where, I have chosen only you." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Whether he carried the burden of the Evans family or the S organization behind him, none of it mattered in front of Amelia. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He loved her more than anything, more than his own life. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one or anything was more important than her. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I understand." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia raised her finger and gently touched James's handsome </span><span>face,</span><span> her touch filled with tenderness. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"When I said I would never see you again, it was just anger talking." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No matter how many times she was abandoned, she still loved him. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was something that would be hard to change. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James's heavy and uncomfortable heart gradually eased. "From now on, nothing will hold me back." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying this, James raised his palm and gently touched Amelia's swollen belly. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can finally relax and spend the rest of my life with you and our child." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although he didn't know when the chip in his brain would activate, he would find a way to live longer. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking up at James, Amelia saw his determination and overflowing love in his affectionate gaze. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I and our child will never leave you." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They made promises to each other, and the atmosphere between them no longer had any barriers, only love. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James held the woman in his arms tightly, and when they were close enough, his longing would grow uncontrollable. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James held Amelia's small mouth, his Adam's apple rolling slightly with a sexy vibration. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a moment of restraint, it didn't seem so obvious. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But after more than half a year without properly embracing or kissing her, James, who missed her deeply, couldn't resist anymore. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Amelia." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James leaned in close, his high nose touching her cheek. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The closeness made Amelia feel at ease. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instinctively, she tilted her chin up, bringing her face closer to his handsome cheek. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tell me." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her soft voice made James's heart race. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had originally wanted to say, "I miss you so much," but what came out was: "I </span><span>want to kiss you." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James was always so bold and straightforward when expressing his love, although it was sincere, it also made people blush. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia's cheeks turned slightly red on both sides, but as a married couple, they were used to such things and didn't feel embarrassed. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your injury hasn't healed yet." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My injury is in my shoulder, not my mouth." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia pursed her lips and smiled. She wanted to say something else, but James lowered his head and pressed his warm lips against her red ones. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James was skilled in kissing, he captured her upper lip and gently, with moderation, pried open her teeth. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He lightly bit the soft part of her lips, and in an instant, his adrenaline surged, turning the gentle kiss into a passionate one. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia, who was pressed against the bed, thought he would stop after a quick kiss, after all, he was injured. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But James, as if going crazy, didn't let go after the initial kiss.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He took away all the air between their lips and teeth. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James noticed that she couldn't keep up with her breath, so he loosened his grip for a moment, then continued kissing her, taking advantage of the situation. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He held her slender waist tightly, and with all his strength, pulled her closer to his chest. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their breaths intertwined as if there was only the two of them in the world, and they indulged in their longing without any reservations.</span></p></div>
