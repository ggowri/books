        <h1>Chapter 1775 James was devastated</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Brandon pushing Amelia, but in the moment when Amelia was pulled off the ship, James's heart stopped beating. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His beautiful face turned </span><span>pale,</span><span> eyes blurred instantly. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stared at the screen where the two fell into the sea, hoping for a miracle, but after waiting for a while, only Brandon emerged from the water. Then, the sea became calm again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After the video ended, his entire world suddenly darkened, and the surroundings fell silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His body felt weightless, as if about to fall into an endless abyss without a glimpse of hope. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James raised his hand, but it trembled and dropped several times. It took all his strength to finally touch the bite mark above his collarbone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia said, "If she uses my life to threaten you, James, I want you to know that when I came here to find you, I was prepared to die." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wanted to face life and death together with him, but he, in his arrogance, thought driving her away was for her own good.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Was it really for her good? If so, why did she end up in the sea? </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the past, in the name of protection, he had once caused her death. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, after all these years, he had harmed her again. Thinking of the despair in Amelia's eyes when forced to sign the divorce agreement, James shivered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His assumptions, his decisions, were all wrong. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He believed that by pushing her away, she and the child would survive, unaware that the demons of hell were always following her. If he relaxed even a bit, they would tear her apart, leaving no trace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was wrong, terribly wrong. He shouldn't have played games with other women, without any moral boundaries, hurting her. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After hurting her, he shouldn't have let her leave alone, crying. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He should have held her and shielded her from all harm, even in hell. As long as they were together, his Amelia wouldn't face death alone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In this moment, James regretted deeply, a piercing remorse overwhelming all his senses. He couldn't hear, couldn't see; his mind felt like it had snapped, and suddenly, his whole being collapsed. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James, gradually on the verge of a breakdown, moved his hand away from the bite mark above his collarbone. Without hesitation, he slapped himself hard across the face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps exerting all his strength, his flawless profile instantly showed five fingerprint marks, clearly visible as if embedded in the flesh. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This slap caused the recently healed wounds on his back to burst open, blood soaking his clothes, dripping onto the ground. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man, however, felt no pain, only numbness, sitting against the wall with strands of hair falling over his eyes, looking full of despair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From the beginning, when he agreed to come to Erebus, it was to break away from S, thinking that this way, he could avoid any danger and peacefully spend his life with her. But the initial strong belief was gone. Once a person loses faith, the world collapses, like removing the blood embedded in the marrow, losing all immunity in an instant, allowing thousands of bacteria to crazily invade the body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, James was like that, utterly desolate, devoid of any hope. Seeing James like this, Emily was delighted, raising her hands and applauding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That woman finally died. I'm so happy!" She walked slowly to James, bending down in front of him. She extended her hand, replaying the video.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My dad said she died miserably, not sure if she was swallowed by a shark or bitten by some creature. Anyway, not a bone left..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man, dead inside, showed no reaction. His vertical pupils were no different from a dead person's, except for the fact that he kept staring at the video. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emily's hand moved from the phone to James's face, as if caressing her lover. Her fingers gently traced his eyebrows, eyes, nose, and lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>But,</span><span> I can tell you all the details of her death, bit by bit. However, you have to pay a price..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emily's fingers reached James's well-defined chin and, with a firm lift, she leaned closer to those lips she had missed for years.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You spend a night with me, and I'll tell you everything."</span></p></div>
