        <h1>Chapter 1935 Amelia regained her memory</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After some treatment, Amelia's vital signs recovered, but she remained in a coma, unsure if she would wake up again.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Matty, you're too radical. If she doesn't make it through this time, she will never wake up again..." Moore finished treating her and blamed Matty, glancing at him sitting next to him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even if you want to stimulate the patient's memory recovery, you should take a gentler and more indirect approach. Being so radical, it could end up killing her." Matty remained silent, staring at Amelia's pale face, silently waiting for her to wake up.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If she loved James enough, then upon hearing the news of his death and someone trying to harm her child, she would surely wake up again with sheer willpower.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>People from the Lawrence family should be resilient like this.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without this resilience, they wouldn't deserve to have the Lawrence family blood flowing through them.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matty firmly believed that Amelia would wake up and that she would quickly regain her memory under his intense stimulation.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, she had already overcome life and death, so what was a temporary amnesia?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He sat by the bedside like this, guarding her for a day and a night, until the next morning when the sky once again filled with wind and snow.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matty spoke softly, "Amelia, my granddaughter, it's time for you to wake up."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The first 24 hours were the critical period. If she made it through, everything would be fine.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If not, he would be responsible for his granddaughter's death, adding to the guilt he already felt for James.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As time passed slowly and there were no signs of Amelia waking up, Matty's grip on his cane tightened inch by inch.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just when he thought all hope was lost, Amelia's fingers moved slightly...</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matty quickly woke up the drowsy Moore. "Her fingers moved, quickly check if she's waking up!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moore rubbed his sleepy eyes, got up, and walked to the bedside, picking up the instrument to examine her. "Wait another five minutes to see if she can open her eyes. If she can, then everything will be fine..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Five minutes may seem short, but for Matty, it was an agonizing wait.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stared at Amelia, silently pleading for her to wake up.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps his expectations were too great, but Amelia slowly opened her eyes, just as he had hoped...</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She still felt the cold breath of snowflakes first, gradually regaining her senses. However, this time was different from the last.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her clear eyes, upon meeting Matty's gaze, were filled with intense hatred.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why are you so cruel?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matty felt relieved upon hearing these words, as if he didn't care at all that Amelia hated him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was just happy that she had regained her memory.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia coldly glanced at him, raised her weak finger, and touched the tubes attached to her body.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With determination, she endured the pain and pulled them out.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she pulled them out, fresh blood flowed from the tubes, causing her eyes to redden from the pain.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She ignored it and continued pulling out the next one.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What are you doing?" Matty held Amelia's hand to stop her, unable to believe what he was seeing. "You just woke up from a severe coma and still need treatment. Are you trying to kill yourself?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia, sweating from the pain, didn't have the strength to push him away.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She could only stare at Matty with her bloodshot eyes and said, "Because of my amnesia, I hurt him. I have to find him..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matty didn't allow it. "He's not dead yet. You can wait until you're fully recovered before going to find him and explain everything."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia frowned and, with all her strength, pushed Matty's hand away.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, she grabbed the tubes and forcefully pulled them out again, causing blood to flow once more. She didn't make a sound and continued pulling...</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Watching Amelia's stubbornness, Matty tried to stop her again. "You don't care about yourself, but I care about you. Don't do this. I'll take you to see him..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia raised her bloodshot eyes, filled with coldness, and looked at him. "I don't accept help from a murderer."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Putting a virus chip in James' brain, how is that any different from being a murderer?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just the thought of James enduring such pain alone made Amelia fearless of the pain.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She gritted her teeth and pulled out all the tubes on her body, then struggled to sit up on the hospital bed.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as her feet moved to the edge of the bed, her whole body knelt down. Matty quickly reached out to support her, but Amelia pushed him away. "You put a chip in his brain, wanting to kill him. Don't pretend to care about me anymore..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matty held onto Amelia's shoulders, crouching down helplessly, and explained, "Nick did the chip thing. At that time, I didn't know you were James' wife, let alone my granddaughter. I just thought he had the ability and wanted to keep him, but I was afraid he wouldn't be easily controlled, so I put the chip in his brain..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia broke free from Matty's grasp. "Even if he's not my husband, you opened up his brain and put something like that inside. How much pain do you think he went through? He's also a human being with flesh and blood, but you treated his life as if it were nothing..."</span></p></div>
