        <h1>Chapter 1880 The darkness is end</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After everyone had left, the bombed and charred forest was filled with the smell of burnt wood. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only Holden and Emelyn remained, along with two helicopters.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You should go too," Holden said. Upon hearing his words, Emelyn stood frozen in place. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a long time, she finally found her lost voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Brother, you said that if you didn't come back safely from Erebus, I should find </span><span>someone else to marry. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now that you're here, is that still what you want?" In the past, Emelyn had always spoken in a tentative tone, afraid to confess her feelings directly. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But in this moment, she seemed to have let go of many reservations and confessed her love for Holden.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Holden, instead of avoiding the topic, sighed helplessly. "I am Bernard's descendant. Once Matty finds out, he won't let me go." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>According to Master Davies' inhumane methods, he would definitely reveal Holden's identity once Matty came knocking. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Emelyn followed him, she would have a bleak future.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Holden thought this, Emelyn reached out with her fair and delicate hand, grabbing Holden's wrist and looking at him earnestly. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Brother, don't worry about me. I willingly chose to follow you. No matter what kind of days await us, I will accept them."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had liked Holden for many years, liked him to the point where she was willing to sacrifice her life if he took a step forward. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at the unabashed love in Emelyn's eyes, Holden, despite his hesitation, felt it. It was just his concerns that made him hesitate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Brother, have you thought it through? If you agree, we can take one of the helicopters. If you don't, I'll turn around and marry someone else." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She pointed at the two helicopters facing different directions, as if indicating two paths for Holden to choose.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Holden stared at the two helicopters, hesitating for a long time before forcefully pushing away Emelyn's hand. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Go and marry someone else."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that instant, Emelyn, who had been pushed away, felt a wave of disappointment. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her heart sank, descending into hell, as she took a step back. With each step she retreated, she felt disappointed in Holden's indifference. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally... she reached the position of the helicopter, but Holden didn't take a step forward. Her disappointment grew even stronger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was the kind of person who could love and let go. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After being rejected, she simply turned around and left. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She grabbed the helicopter door, leapt inside, and started it up without any hesitation or pause. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the helicopter was about to take off, the cabin suddenly sank, and a tall figure sat down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The disappointment in Emelyn's heart disappeared in an instant, replaced by a hint of excitement. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Didn't you tell me to go marry someone else? Why did you follow me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Holden raised his gaze and looked at Emelyn's face, slowly lowering his head. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I... I'm afraid... of you marrying someone else." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't know if this was love, but whenever he thought of Emelyn marrying someone else, he felt very sad.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emelyn was somewhat shocked, as if she rarely heard such words from Holden's </span><span>mouth. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you hadn't come up just now, I would have made you regret it for the rest of your life." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Holden knew that Emelyn could say and do what she promised. He couldn't help but feel fortunate that he had followed his instincts earlier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emelyn came out of the cockpit and boldly sat next to Holden, then pouted. "Kiss me, as an invitation for you to be my boyfriend."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing this blunt request, Holden's eyes darted around, avoiding direct eye contact with Emelyn's red lips. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked all around the cabin but couldn't bring himself to meet her gaze. After waiting for a long time, Emelyn frowned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm not shy, why are you?" Holden said directly, "We're too familiar with each other."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Three seconds," Emelyn counted down, and Holden, feeling awkward, leaned forward and lightly kissed Emelyn's lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emelyn then smiled and hooked her lips, hugging Holden's waist and nestling into his embrace, tilting her chin up to ask him, "How does it feel?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Too fast, I didn't feel anything."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll go find someone else then," Holden grabbed Emelyn, who was about to get up, and approached her with some embarrassment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's try again..." Five seconds later, Emelyn asked again, "Do you feel anything now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The first love couple in the helicopter wasn't very happy, but the other helicopter quickly arrived at the hospital. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul, who had received the notification, realized that the detonation program hadn't been activated and quickly rushed to the hospital with the remaining people.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The meeting of the two groups at the hospital represented the end of all the darkness, and what followed was a bright future.</span></p></div>
