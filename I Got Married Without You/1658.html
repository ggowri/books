        <h1>Chapter 1658 When will you stop lying to me?</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Did Eva refuse herself only after seeing Elsie take him home?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ignoring the pain from his toenails, Paul put on his shoes and headed straight to the hospital.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Eva, who had just bought a wheelchair, was pushing it into the elevator, Paul grabbed the handle of the wheelchair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Eva, that night, I got drunk and fell down at the hotel entrance. After Elsie saw me, she took me home."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gasping for breath, Paul explained while taking out his phone and opening the surveillance footage, handing it to Eva to watch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I swear I didn't do anything. Please don't reject me because of this."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at Paul, who was unkempt and had a scruffy beard, Eva instinctively frowned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Did you really not do anything?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul desperately nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, we didn't do anything!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva's eyelashes slowly drooped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Paul, when will you stop lying to me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul was a bit confused.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I didn't lie to you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You said you didn't lie to me, then let me ask you this. When you and Elsie were in the apartment, and she asked if you were comfortable, why did you respond to her?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva's question left Paul stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing that he had no words, Eva's eyes gradually turned red.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Paul, do you think I didn't see anything, that I don't know anything, and you're using this evidence of being drunk to deceive me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For Eva, Paul showing her the evidence was just an excuse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Faced with Eva questioning him, Paul was speechless for a long time, only reacting when Eva pushed his hand off the wheelchair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Eva, I have no recollection of what you're talking about. I was too drunk that night, completely unconscious, I..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, you were unconscious when you had a relationship with Elsie, just like I was unconscious when I had a relationship with you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva lifted her eyes, which were covered in scars, and silently stared at Paul.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But regardless of consciousness, you still had a relationship with her, didn't you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul tried desperately to defend himself, but couldn't find the words to justify it, so he could only shake his head helplessly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't remember, I don't remember anything..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Paul like this, Eva felt extremely disappointed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It doesn't matter if you don't remember. When I went to the apartment to find you, I saw it with my own eyes."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking of the scene she witnessed that night, tears suddenly welled up in Eva's eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the tears, the size of beans, rolled down Eva's eye sockets, Paul's heart ached along </span><span>with it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Eva, I'm sorry..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The apology he made was blaming himself for drinking too much and giving Elsie an opportunity, not admitting that he betrayed her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He never believed that he would touch Elsie, even if he was drunk and unconscious, he couldn't have touched anyone else.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But to Eva, his apology was an admission of having a relationship with Elsie, which was even more devastating than seeing it with her own eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul wanted to wipe away her tears, but she evaded his touch with her slender fingers...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After wiping away the tears on her face, Eva pushed the wheelchair and entered the elevator. Paul wanted to follow, but she stopped him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't come find me again!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as Eva finished speaking, the elevator doors closed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul, locked outside, stared at the elevator doors for a few seconds before quickly opening </span><span>Whatsapp</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He scrolled through the profiles of several friends who knew Elsie, asking them to send him Elsie's phone number.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those friends who had a good relationship with Elsie thought he wanted to reconcile with her, so they quickly sent it to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the number in hand, Paul quickly dialed...</span></p></div>
