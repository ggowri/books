        <h1>Chapter 1672 I beg you</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva was stunned, looking at him in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're forcing me," she said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah," Paul shrugged indifferently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I am forcing you, so what?" he said, acting like a rogue, leaving Eva speechless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She tried to walk past the unreasonable Paul, but he pulled her back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you don't want me to rummage through your room, then come with me and get married," he said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva frowned at his words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I disagree."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul squeezed her shoulder, leaned down, and looked at her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I beg you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those words struck Eva's heart, causing a slight pain. She looked up at him, his handsome face overlapping with the image etched in her memory.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that moment, she deeply felt her love for him. Maybe the 50% of her love had already unconsciously risen to 70%.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She knew that once her love reached 100%, it would be difficult for her to let go of Paul for the rest of her life. Faced with this clear realization, should she choose him again?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Forget it, what use is your plea," she hesitated to respond, causing Paul to suddenly release his grip on her shoulder and walk towards the dressing table. He opened a drawer and quickly pulled out a stack of documents.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva watched Paul's tall figure as he searched for his ID, feeling a complex mix of emotions rushing through her. She didn't know what to do.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was well aware that choosing him meant enduring the constant presence of other women in his life, whether they were pursuers or others. Unless he truly cut ties with women, but Paul was different from James, he seemed unable to maintain boundaries with women.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul himself was unaware of this, which gave women like Kayla, Elsie, and Camilla the opportunity to harm her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She feared that she would lower her own bottom line and tolerate Paul's infidelity. She couldn't imagine herself becoming so helpless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With these thoughts, Eva took a step forward and quickly stopped Paul.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop looking, I won't give you my ID."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul's already dark face turned even darker, as if ink was dripping from it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He threw the documents in his hand, without looking at Eva, and turned to search the bedside table.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing his determination, Eva followed to stop him, but an angry Paul pushed her away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva staggered a few steps, her body swaying, and then fell to the side...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her lower abdomen hit the wooden sofa handle, causing some pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had thought that what was inside her belly was just an undeveloped mass, and it wouldn't create any emotional attachment, but now...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When the pain came, a sense of fear and panic suddenly overwhelmed her, causing her to instinctively touch her stomach.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She couldn't help but develop emotional attachment to this child, just as she couldn't help but fall in love with Paul, even if she desperately tried to restrain her feelings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva forced a bitter smile, propped herself up on the sofa, stood up straight, and looked at Paul standing beside her with anger on his face, his hand reaching out to her and then awkwardly retracting it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you really want to get married?" she asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul clenched his fist, stared at Eva, and spoke coldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A child can't be without a mother."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just because of the child?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What do you think?" he replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva didn't answer, she just looked at him. Paul sighed helplessly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Eva, if I only wanted the child, I wouldn't even think about marrying you."</span></p></div>
