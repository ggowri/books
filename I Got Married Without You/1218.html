        <h1>Chapter 1218 Jonny’s excuse sucks (2)</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jonny, who was about the same height as James, looked up and met his gaze. He was struck by the clear, watery eyes that seemed to hold a stream of emotions. Jonny's heart skipped a beat, and he instinctively looked away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I just met her. She brought a lot of people with her and said they were going to your house to take the child..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then I have to go back and check!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia pretended to be nervous and quickly got up, but James held her waist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Eva needs to see you urgently. You go see her, and I'll go back and check."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James probably couldn't stand Jonny's lame excuse, so he made up one himself to get rid of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suppressing the urge to laugh, Amelia took James' hand and pretended to be worried. "If it weren't for the urgent matter, I would have gone with you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James patted her hand and reassured her, "It's the same for me to go alone. Besides, with me there, Jocelyn won't dare to cause trouble in our house."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Amelia nodding without any trace of acting, James picked up his coat and got up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jonny didn't expect to fool James so easily. The corners of his mouth slowly curved upwards.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before he could even raise his eyebrows and show a victorious smile, James, who had walked halfway, suddenly turned back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're quite familiar with Jocelyn. Why don't you come with me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jonny frowned. "Why should I follow you, I am an outsider, to deal with your business with Jocelyn?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James put his coat in the crook of his arm, put his hands in his pockets, and stared at Jonny with a half-smile. "Who knows if you're deliberately trying to get rid of me and then kidnap my wife?"</span></p></div>
