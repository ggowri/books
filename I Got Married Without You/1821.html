        <h1>Chapter 1821 The family tree</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia didn't reply, and after a while, Johnny smiled lightly and said, "Don't worry, my uncle has always been good to me since I was a child, he won't harm me." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Carson, knowing that he was the vice president of the Eurasian Union Chamber of Commerce, still wanted to help Erebus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Johnny found evidence to confirm this, their positions would be hostile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What Johnny was more concerned about was how to persuade Carson to leave Erebus and how to deal with Erebus's existence. However, these things had nothing to do with Amelia, so he didn't tell her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia's main concern was still James, but Johnny didn't get any information from Carson, so she didn't ask him either. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a moment of silence, the wardrobe stylist came in with a new dress. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia asked him to take care of Gigi and then hung up the phone. The stylist quickly helped her change into the latest dress.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia inherited the excellent genes of the Lawrence family, with beautiful eyes, rosy cheeks, and a graceful and elegant demeanor. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She exuded a subtle and elegant air. Her overall appearance was graceful and elegant, </span><span>and she looked ethereal in the champagne-colored dress.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When the three Lawrence brothers saw her come out, they all stood up and walked up to her. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The first time I saw you, I thought you were beautiful, but after dressing up, you are even more stunning," Owen exclaimed. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's a pity we didn't grow up together, otherwise, we would have protected you like a porcelain doll," Eugene sighed. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dylan, on the other hand, remained silent and just watched her quietly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When the four siblings stood in front of the mirror, Stephanie approached and said, "Amelia, if you're interested, you can work with Eugene as a spokesperson for DK." Amelia admired this independent and strong woman and spoke with respect, "My dream is to have a company like yours." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eugene, leaning casually with his arms crossed, immediately added, "Then you can hire me as a spokesperson in the future. I promise to promote your products." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia looked hesitant, "But I'm an architectural designer. I can't just put your picture on every construction site, can I?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eugene's smile froze, "I take back what I said." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia smiled, and this was the first time she had smiled since coming to Canada. The three Lawrence brothers couldn't help but smile as well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After the styling was done, it was almost time for the banquet. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The three brothers took Amelia back home, and Matty's house had been decorated by the two uncles. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was all in pink, looking like a birthday party for a little girl, even though she was about to become a mother. The Lawrence family still treated her like a little girl.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia knew they were trying to make up for the lack of her childhood, but as she said, the things she wanted as a child didn't bring her joy when she finally got them as an adult. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Compared to the busy Lawrence family, she appeared much calmer, as if she was just waiting for a ceremony to be over so she could return to her own home.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>During the banquet, many important people arrived, and Matty introduced Amelia to each of them. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Probably informed by Stephanie about her dream, Matty made it clear to everyone that she was an architectural designer. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As a result, many people approached Amelia to do design work. This was the Lawrence family's network and resources given to her, and while she didn't plan to use them, she didn't reject them on the spot either.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After introducing her and helping her with resources, Matty took her hand and together they cut a four-tiered cake, symbolizing her successful return to the Lawrence family. The next step was to go through the family tree. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matty asked Dylan to go to the study to get the family tree, and after glancing at Amelia, Dylan leisurely went upstairs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He quickly took the family tree and handed it to Matty, who, in front of everyone, opened it up. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>River picked up a gold-plated pen and wrote </span><span>Sumasa's</span><span> name on the family tree, </span><span>followed by Skender, and then Amelia. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After he finished, Matty suddenly looked at Amelia, who was standing quietly beside him, and asked, "Is your sister's child named Grace?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia nodded without saying anything. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matty, seeing that she didn't object, quickly asked River to write Grace's name on the family tree. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all the children who had been away from the family were added to the family tree, Matty's face showed a few more smiles.</span></p></div>
