        <h1>Chapter 1684 The duty of a husband</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On Eva's side, she didn't feel it was formal to send a message or call Amelia. She planned to wait for Paul to come back and personally tell Amelia after he let her out. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While thinking about it, Eva saw a beam of headlights outside the French windows, followed by the sound of wheels rolling on the ground. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not long after, Paul, tall and handsome, opened the car door and slowly got out. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was the first time she had waited for her husband to come home, and she couldn't help but feel a bit awkward, but she didn't show it on her face. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She got up from the sofa and walked towards Paul. Paul took off his coat and loosened his tie, intending to hand it over to the servant, but Eva reached out and took it, as if she had been his wife for many years. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul, who was immersed in the James incident, gradually felt better when he saw Eva's warmth. "You don't have to do these things." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He took the coat and tie from her hand, threw them to the servant, then held her hand and walked towards the dining room. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing the untouched dishes on the table, Paul knew that Eva had been waiting for him, which warmed his heart even more. "If I come back late in the future, you can eat first and don't wait for me." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was still carrying their baby, so she shouldn't let herself go hungry. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva didn't intentionally wait for </span><span>him,</span><span> she just didn't have much appetite. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But seeing Paul's touched expression, she didn't reveal her little thoughts. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After he helped her sit down, Eva picked up a piece of beef and put it in his bowl. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although they didn't speak, her actions moved Paul deeply. "Honey, you are so good to me." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In reality, Eva had accidentally put too much salt in the beef while the servant was </span><span>cooking, and she wanted him to taste if it was too salty. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul, who was completely unaware, happily ate the salty beef, with a pair of bright eyes looking at Eva with a smile. "Although the meat is salty, since you served it to me, I will finish it all..." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva felt a little guilty when she heard this and lowered her head to drink her porridge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After they finished dinner and took their baths, they returned to the master bedroom wearing their pajamas. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva was about to turn off the lights, but Paul stopped her, then opened a drawer and came out with a safe. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In front of Eva, he entered the password, opened it, and then took out all the bank cards inside, handing them all to Eva. "Eva, this is all my wealth, all for you." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva stared at the bank cards for a while, reached out and took them, and then put them back into Paul's safe. "I have money, I don't need yours." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her income from the night market was very high every year, and she would be fine for a lifetime. She didn't need Paul's money. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul, however, didn't care whether she had money or not, he just gave her all of his things without hesitation. "Whether you use it or not, I have to give them to you." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was the duty of a husband. After saying that, Paul took out a pile of property certificates, car documents, and other properties and stuffed them into Eva's hands. "I will transfer these to you tomorrow." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Surrounded by a pile of real estate, Eva was a little dazed, looking at Paul. "I really don't need them..." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Paul smiled at her, he put all these things back into the safe and handed the safe to her. "Keep it here for our baby in the future." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The phrase "our baby" warmed Eva's heart inexplicably. She didn't know what the child would look like, whether they would resemble her or Paul. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she fantasized about what the child would be like, Paul's expression gradually became guilty... "Babe, what would you do if our baby had a bad name?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I wouldn't do anything." Hearing this, Paul suddenly felt relieved. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But before he could fully relax, Eva added, "As long as it's not Ben or Barbie." Paul swallowed his saliva subconsciously when he heard that, then gathered up the courage to ask tentatively, "What if we really named the child that?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva, closing the safe, raised her eyes filled with a chilling aura and stared at Paul&mdash; "If you dare to give our child such a name, I'll kill you!" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul:...</span><span> </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He regretted boasting in front of James. Now, his life was in danger... </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry, how could I give our child such a name?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's about right." Eva closed the safe and handed it back to Paul. "Put it back where it belongs." Paul wanted to say something, but Eva interrupted him. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anyway, now that we're married, these things are inseparable. It doesn't matter where they are kept."</span></p></div>
