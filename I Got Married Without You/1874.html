        <h1>Chapter 1874 Matty knew the truth</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is it because I killed Daley that Bernard retaliated against Sophia?" Matty couldn't believe it. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had investigated the Parsons family from the beginning, as it was him who killed Daley, so it was normal for the Parsons family to seek revenge. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, Bernard had always shown great respect in front of the Lawrence family, especially his father.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even when his son died, Bernard didn't dare to question them. How could such a timid man establish a dark organization and then kill Sophia in such a brutal way?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matty was still full of doubts. "If Bernard knew that his son was killed by me, why didn't he come directly to seek revenge?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bernard didn't come directly to seek revenge because of your ex-wife, Zelene."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matty and Zelene had an agreement that their marriage contract would automatically dissolve after three years. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately, Zelene fell ill and passed away before the collaboration period ended. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her death occurred shortly after Sophia was killed. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that time, Matty was too focused on finding Sophia's killer and didn't pay any attention to Zelene. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She remained in the room for three days, and her body started to decompose before Matty received the notification from the police. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, it was only a business partnership, so Matty didn't even bother to go and see her, just sending someone to handle it. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matty's acquaintance with Zelene was arranged by his father as a marriage alliance, and they had only met a few times.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now James was saying that Bernard didn't come to seek revenge because of Zelene, and Matty was puzzled. "What does Zelene have to do with Sophia's situation?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James raised his deep and calm eyes, looking at the old man with white hair not far away. "After you killed Daley, she framed Sophia."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James's tone was very calm, as if he was talking about something insignificant. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But these seemingly casual words hit Matty like a fatal blow. "What?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Zelene didn't want to divorce, so she decided to get rid of Sophia." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Matty was shocked, he was also intelligent. James only hinted at it, and he immediately understood, but he still hesitated. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But... when I was arranged for the marriage, she made it clear that she didn't like me, and I chose her. Moreover, she agreed to a series of demands I made and said she was forced into the marriage, which could be a good opportunity for cooperation. Also, she suddenly fell ill and passed away after Sophia's death." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matty's words were full of doubt, but after questioning, he slowly realized that something was wrong. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Could it be that Zelene's behavior at that time was intentional?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She knew that Matty only loved Sophia, so she pretended not to care, became his wife first, and gradually infiltrated his world?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But she died soon after, without gaining anything..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James looked at Matty with extremely compassionate eyes, as if he was looking at </span><span>someone who had lost all ability to think. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If I'm not mistaken, Bernard probably knew from the beginning that you killed Sophia and that Zelene framed and accused him. But Bernard didn't dare to offend the Lawrence family, who had a hand in everything, so he shifted his anger onto Sophia." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bernard had the darkness thugs replace Daley and gang-rape Sophia, which was clearly an act of venting anger rather than seeking revenge. Master Davies also said that Bernard thought Sophia had abandoned Daley to climb up the Lawrence family, even killing him. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Zelene's clumsy methods, how could Bernard, who grew up on the streets, not notice the problem? It was undoubtedly an intentional act of venting anger. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As for Zelene, she was probably also killed by Bernard."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matty was puzzled. "Why would he do that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The reason is simple, he was afraid that you would trace it back to him, so he cut off the only clue." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dead people can't speak, which is why Zelene suddenly fell ill and passed away after Sophia's death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you saying that Bernard did all this to hide himself, expand darkness, accumulate power, and then seek revenge against me?"</span></p></div>
