        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't move!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James was about to casually draw a card when Herb suddenly shouted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let me go first!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without waiting for James to react, Herb jumped to the front of the table and crouched down, a bit nervous, reaching out his hand...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After five minutes, Herb's fingers were still flipping through the cards, picking from left to right and then from right to left...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you going to draw or not?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Impatient Johnny kicked Herb's leg again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Trembling, Herb reached out to draw a card.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then without even looking at it, he hugged it to his chest and motioned for James to draw a card.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bored James extended his slender, powerful fingers and randomly drew a card.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He also didn't bother to look at it, just flipped it over and threw it on the table...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James didn't draw the big joker, he got the little joker.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Herb saw that little joker, he jumped up from the ground with joy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I got the big joker!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Herb was so happy he couldn't stop smiling, while Paul rolled his eyes in madness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I explained the rules earlier, the final round will still be played with number cards, and drawing the jokers counts as two wins for the players who got them, while others are eliminated."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul didn't understand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why do two people have to win?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Herb smirked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You'll find out when the game is over."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Herb drew the big joker, as agreed beforehand, and he would set all the rules.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now there were five people left: James, Amelia, Eva, Johnny, and Herb.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In addition to the two jokers, three more random cards were placed on the table by the </span><span>waiter who had shuffled the deck with the game participants facing away, and then the waiter left after touching the cards.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The eliminated onlookers, each betting on one of the five players, nervously and expectantly watched them draw lots to determine the order, and then draw and reveal the cards &mdash;&mdash;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Number 1, Eva revealed first, it was a 2.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Number 2, Herb, got a 10.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That left James, Johnny, and Amelia. As long as James drew the big joker, he would win, and it didn't matter who the other winner was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James was casual and drew one of the remaining three cards &mdash;&mdash;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As everyone's breath momentarily stopped, watching those clearly defined knuckles slowly flip the card over&mdash;&mdash;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"K!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Herb, who was more nervous than anyone else, breathed a sigh of relief when he saw that the card wasn't a joker.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alright, now he could start messing with James.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Evans drew a K, so my cousin and my sister don't need to draw anymore, they've won."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia, who won for no apparent reason, scratched her head in disbelief. When did her luck become so good?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Johnny, equally surprised, furrowed his brow. He had been unlucky his whole life and had never won in a casino before. What was happening today?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Regardless of what the two confused winners were thinking, Herb stood up and announced the rewards and punishments for the winners and losers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The losers don't need to face any punishments, but the two winners must accept a reward, which is..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the one who knew the rules, Herb shouted loudly &mdash;&mdash;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kiss each other!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since he didn't get to kiss Amelia last time, he would leave it to his cousin this time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And it would be even better if he could make James furious with this opportunity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James, sitting in the main seat, suddenly turned dark.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Johnny's heart skipped a beat, and he instinctively looked at Amelia's luscious, enticing lips...</span></p></div>
