        <h1>Chapter 1671 Amelia was surrounded by admirers</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Johnny walked with three people to the entrance of the wedding hall. His eyes glanced past James and landed on Amelia standing next to him. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia looked up at the same time and their eyes met briefly before Johnny quickly looked away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James, holding Amelia's hand, couldn't stand the way Johnny was sneaking glances at his wife. Subconsciously, he let go of Amelia's hand and instead tightened his grip </span><span>around her waist. He tilted his head slightly and looked down on Johnny with disdain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Johnny noticed this and clenched his fist. Then he looked towards Zack standing beside him. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zack quickly stepped forward and tried to defuse the situation. "Mr. Evans," Zack said, "Johnny says that no matter what, Amelia is considered part of the Clark family. Her sister is getting married, so of course they came to give their congratulations. That's why I brought them along."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After explaining, Zack flashed a big smile, awkwardly laughed at James and Amelia, and his facial expressions and forced gaze indicated that what he just said was all a lie. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In reality, Johnny and Herb overheard that Zack was bringing Gigi to the wedding and they shamelessly followed along.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James didn't bother with them and pulled Amelia to leave. But as guests, Amelia couldn't let them feel too embarrassed. "The groom and bride are in the lounge, Zack. Take them to give their congratulations..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zack held Gigi's hand and looked at Johnny. "Johnny, let's go inside..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For the sake of Gigi, Zack always either flattered or appeased Johnny. He treated Johnny with more care than he did Gigi. Finally, Johnny acknowledged him as his brother-in-law, and only then did Zack dare to call him "Johnny."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Johnny glanced at Zack and then quickened his pace towards the wedding hall. However, as he passed James standing at the door, he purposely bumped into his shoulder. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But there's a difference between those who exercise regularly and those who don't. Johnny not only failed to push James away, but he stumbled himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James caught Johnny, who was about to fall, and looked down on him with contempt. "Mr. Brook, if your body is so weak, remember to take more supplements. Don't end up ascending to heaven before marrying your wife."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Johnny's face turned red with anger, and he wanted to retort to James. But then he accidentally caught sight of Amelia beside them, who was staring at his waist, as if questioning why he couldn't find a wife because of his weak waist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With so many people at the entrance, Johnny couldn't justify himself. He could only shake off James' hand on his arm and raise his index finger. Through gritted teeth, he pointed at James and turned around, quickly walking into the wedding hall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Johnny went in, Herb approached Amelia with a bouquet of flowers. "Sister, long time no see. Flowers for a beautiful lady. I wish you eternal youth, health, and beauty."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just because they first met, Herb had been calling her sister. Even after finding out she wasn't part of the Clark family, he still called her that. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia found it quite heartwarming and reached out to accept the flowers. "Thank you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Herb smiled and replied, "You're welcome."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying that, Herb provocatively glanced at James, whose face darkened visibly. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James clenched his powerful finger into a fist, but Amelia quickly spoke up to refuse. "No need, my husband gives me a bouquet of litchi roses every day. One bouquet is </span><span>enough."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Herb didn't mind and raised an eyebrow. "No problem, if not flowers, then I'll give you something else. As long as my sister is happy."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia awkwardly smiled at Herb. In her impression, Herb was the kind of carefree and rebellious young man. How did he become greasy all of a sudden after such a short time?</span></p></div>
