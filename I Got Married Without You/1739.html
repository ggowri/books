        <h1>Chapter 1739 Ship 1</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The determination in her eyes shook Johnny to the core, as if at that moment, he realized that Amelia's love for James had reached a level of depth that could transcend life and death. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To her, James was like the dawn, and if the dawn didn't come as promised the next day, she would forever be stuck in yesterday's dusk.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The bond between life and death was never just talk for them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Johnny realized this and for the first time felt like he couldn't measure up to James. But Amelia was the first girl he liked, so he had to do something for her, otherwise, what's the point of liking her?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia didn't know what Johnny was thinking and simply said to him, "Mr. Brook, even though you said Erebus is very strict with its rules, losing means death. You shouldn't go. As for Gigi's obsession, leave it to me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Johnny instantly got angry, "I arranged so many people to go destroy Erebus, do you think I'm playing house? You said the first half of your life was unlucky, do you think the first half of my life wasn't unlucky? How can you assume my luck won't turn around like yours?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia, unable to persuade him, took out a gold leaf and explained, "I won't let you go. One, I'm afraid of putting you in danger, and two, you don't have a gold leaf. Erebus's people probably won't let you in, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Johnny couldn't understand why, as someone from a prestigious family, Erebus didn't send him an invitation. Did Erebus also look down on him? This made him even angrier, "I have my ways, you don't need to worry about it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia wanted to continue persuading him, but Johnny got angry. Faced with a man who could erupt into rage at any moment, she closed her mouth, restarted the car, and quickly drove to the dock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two remained silent on the way and when they arrived at the dock, Amelia got out of the car, went to the trunk, and took out a suitcase. Just as she placed it on the ground, Johnny took out a pair of handcuffs and cuffed her left wrist to his right wrist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia looked at the handcuffs and instinctively frowned, "Is this your idea?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Johnny, with his hands in his pockets, looked away and didn't respond. Amelia tried to say something but ultimately stayed silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Johnny then kicked her suitcase, "Don't bring these, Erebus won't allow you to bring anything."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia brought the suitcase because she had helped James pack before, and he had taken a suitcase with him. She wanted to try and see if it would work, "I'll try first."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Johnny didn't stop her, he leaned against the trunk and waited for Erebus's people to show up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After waiting for a long time, a five-year-old girl came running over and handed Amelia a note, "A man asked me to give this to you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia was surprised to see the little girl but still took the note and opened it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[Ship 1]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is the man asking me to board the ship?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't know." The little girl finished her reply and tried to hop away, only to be lifted off the ground by Johnny's collar.</span></p></div>
