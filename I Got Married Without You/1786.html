        <h1>Chapter 1786 Brandon saved Amelia</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Boss, James is the leader of S. After Nick found out, instead of killing him, he sent people to hunt me down, which means he betrayed Erebus. Did you kill the </span><span>traitor</span><span> Nick?" </span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>nodded calmly. "I killed him." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing that 1-1 killed Nick, Emily was in a great mood. "You are indeed the boss." After praising him, she stood up and walked to 1-1, placing her hands on his shoulders. "Boss, I have made such a big contribution to Erebus. Shouldn't I be rewarded?" </span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>looked down and saw her hands resting on his shoulders. "What reward do you want?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Completely unaware of the murderous intent in 1-1's eyes, Emily leaned in close to 1-1's ear. "Since 1-2 is dead, why not let me take his place and manage Erebus in his stead?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, but..." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing him agree, but with additional conditions, Emily became anxious. "But what?" 1-1 did not rush to answer, but grabbed Emily's hand and gently patted the back of her hand. "Ms. Moore, didn't I say that operatives should not interfere with the life and death of players?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emily realized that 1-1 was blaming her for killing Amelia without his consent and quickly explained, "Boss, I didn't follow the rules. After the player left, I sent someone to kill her because James manipulated the situation."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He let Amelia cheat and then let her leave. I thought that she was someone who should have died in Erebus, so I went after her." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is that so?" Faced with Emily's sophistry, 1-1 just chuckled. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This eerie smile, seen by Emily, was terrifying. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, she thought that since she had exposed the leader of S, her achievements outweighed her mistakes, and 1-1 wouldn't do anything to her, right? </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Little did she know that as soon as this thought crossed her mind, 1-1 suddenly grabbed her by the neck and pressed her head firmly against the conference table. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Without my consent, you indiscriminately killed innocent people. You are simply seeking death!" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>1-1's grip was strong, and within three seconds, Emily, who was pressed against the table, had turned purple and was convulsing. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brandon, who was standing nearby, thought that 1-1 would praise them for doing well, but who would have thought that this would be the result. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was so scared that he rushed over to try to save Emily from 1-1, but was pinned to the ground by the black-clothed men behind 1-1. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unable to fight back, Brandon could only beg 1-1 for mercy. "Sir, please spare my daughter's life, considering the contributions we have made to Erebus!" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had indeed helped Erebus using the list of S members, but this was not a reason to boast. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, without even looking at Brandon, 1-1 threatened to kill Emily. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She's not dead!" Brandon, who was forced to do so, suddenly shouted. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Amelia isn't dead! I saved her! Spare my daughter!" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brandon's desperate cries reached 1-1's ears, causing him to slowly release his grip. "Not dead?" Breaking free from the black-clothed men's restraint, Brandon rushed over to hold Emily, who was barely breathing, pinching her philtrum while trembling as he spoke. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She shouldn't be dead. When I saved her, she was still breathing. I just don't know if someone came to save her after I left." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the end, Brandon couldn't overcome his guilt and returned halfway through swimming. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had no choice but to manipulate the video. He didn't want Emily to be disappointed, and he didn't want Amelia to die, so he had to do it. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Where is she now?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If she wasn't saved, she should still be on the deserted island." </span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>gave a look to the person beside him, and the black-clothed man immediately went to find someone. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emily, who was slowly regaining her strength on the ground, raised her bloodshot eyes and stared at Brandon. "Why didn't you kill her?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I..." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brandon didn't know how to face Emily and was hesitant in his speech. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing him like this, Emily grabbed Brandon's collar and, in a fit of rage, shouted at him. "You know that Amelia is the person I hate the most. Why didn't you help me kill her? Why?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Because..." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Because Amelia is his daughter." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brandon's unspoken words were answered by Carson, who was standing nearby. Brandon looked at Carson in surprise, his eyes filled with confusion, as if asking Carson how he knew.</span></p></div>
