        <h1>Chapter 1655 You don't have even a tiny place</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva looked up and stared at Paul, who pretended to be clueless, with a cold smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just pretend that I don't love you that much."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't love him that much...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So</span><span> she didn't want to marry him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>More than his mother's opposition, this hurt Paul the most, but...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I know you don't love me that much, but as long as I have a tiny place in your heart, it's enough."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kate witnessed her son, Paul, begging Eva in a pitiful manner and suddenly felt sorry for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had always thought that Eva was the one clinging onto Paul, but as James had said, it was her son who couldn't let go.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And Eva, facing her son's plea, not only was not moved, but also looked expressionless, staring at Paul, who was almost kneeling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Paul, you don't have even a tiny place in my heart."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul didn't believe her words at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If I don't have even a tiny place, then why did you... that night?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I was drunk!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva coldly interrupted him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That night, even if it wasn't you, it could have been any other man."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When these cold and heartless words struck, it felt like being stabbed by a sword, making Paul turn pale.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Eva, when you say such things, have you ever considered my feelings?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't love you at all, so why should I consider your feelings?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This counter-question caused Paul's clear eyes to gradually turn red.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He took a step forward, grabbed Eva's wrist, but she reacted strongly and shook him off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This repeated resistance suddenly infuriated Paul-</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He disregarded everything and held Eva's shoulders, pushing her against the wall, and then pulling her into his arms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While suppressing the urge to vomit, Eva struggled desperately, but he held her hands with one hand and used his legs to trap her legs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After making her unable to move, Paul pinched her chin, making her look up, staring angrily into her evasive eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Eva, look into my eyes and say it again, do you really not love me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wanted to take it slowly, but this stubborn Eva made it impossible for him to do so!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Forced to meet his gaze, Eva, with anger in Paul's eyes, indifferently spoke.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't love you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These few words extinguished all of Paul's anger, leaving only cold blood flowing through his body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stared at Eva, trying to see any trace of a lie in her eyes, but all he saw was disgust and disdain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at Eva like this, Paul stared blankly for a while and then weakly let her go.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva, able to breathe again, turned and ran, as if she stayed for another moment, that 50% of love would make her stay.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing the two argue, Kate quickly walked to Paul's side, raised her pale hand, and patted his shoulder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"When I talked to Ms. Miller earlier, I asked her if she loved you. Her answer was no, and she shouldn't have lied to you about that."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul, whose heart was already bleeding, smiled coldly at these words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If she doesn't love me, then there's no need for anyone to beg her!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leaving these words behind, Paul turned around and walked in the opposite direction of Eva.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he passed the tables and chairs placed in the hallway, he raised his leg and kicked them hard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With this resentful action, his toenails inside his shoes flipped over...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul, who used to find even a gentle bump painful, now felt nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Standing in the hallway, Kate couldn't describe the feeling inside her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was the result she wanted, but seeing Eva truly reject Paul, she felt a bit sorry for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a complicated mood, she glanced at Eva's back and then at Paul's back before catching up with her son's footsteps.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After returning to Ryan's place, Eva rolled up her sleeves and went to the kitchen to prepare dinner.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not long after, the smell of fish came from the pot. Eva, who should have found it fragrant and delicious, suddenly felt nauseous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought the fish had gone bad, so she quickly lifted the lid and tasted it with a spoon. The urge to vomit almost made her throw up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fortunately, she only dry heaved and didn't actually vomit. She didn't pay much attention to it, put down the spoon, and poured the fish into the trash can...</span></p></div>
