        <h1>Chapter 1733 The Canary</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia was calm, shaking her head at Peter, "It's okay, I just had a bad night's sleep and had the doctor prescribe more medicine."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Peter reached out to take the medicine from Amelia's hand, but she avoided it, "I can do this little thing."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Peter did not ask more questions, just stared at the gold leaf in her hand, just too far away, he did not see the words and note engraved on the back of the gold leaf, only know that a man entrusted a little girl to send the gold leaf to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Amelia turned around with the medicine, she saw Johnny, who was the same height as James, with his hands in his pockets, standing at the entrance of the hospital hall, with his back to the light, waiting for her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She paused in her steps and walked up to him when Johnny whispered, "Get in my car."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia hesitated for a moment and followed Johnny out, before getting into the car, Peter tried to follow and was stopped by Johnny, as the two were about to clash, Amelia stopped, "Peter, wait for me outside the car."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Peter could only stop in front of the door, through the thick car film, staring at the inside of Johnny, while Johnny's line of sight, was across Amelia's pale and thin face, looking to the medicine in her hand: "Are you okay?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia couldn't say what she felt, she only hooked her lips towards him, "Fine."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Johnny was silent for a few seconds before opening his mouth again, "I told you to go back to Holden the other day and ask him about it before I came back to you for answers, can you tell me now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia asked in disbelief, "Why do you need to know that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Johnny said, "I'm the vice president of the Eurasian Union Chamber of Commerce, S borrowed the power of the World Family and frequently struck the Chamber of Commerce, damaging the interests of many chambers, I have the responsibility to track down S and give the members of the Union of Chambers an explanation."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia hooked her lips and smiled coldly, "But what S got rid of was only a tumor in the business world."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Johnny was noncommittal, "I don't deny that S targets all the tumors, but the existence of tumors inevitably has a reason for its existence, and it's not by getting rid of them with an iron fist that they can disappear from this world forever."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Johnny's point is, this world has a sunny side, there is bound to be a dark side, just like the weeds that grow again in the spring breeze, how to get rid of them can not be eliminated, but also would lead to a whole body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But that's none of Amelia's business: "There's no point in you knowing that now that they're all gone, and since you're well aware of it yourself, there's nothing I can tell you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What she learned about S, wasn't that comprehensive, maybe not as much as Johnny </span><span>knew.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Johnny wasn't annoyed, "All you have to do is tell me where they went, and if it was Erebus."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia didn't expect Johnny to know about Erebus, and her grip on the box tightened a few more points.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't confirm if Johnny was related to Erebus or not, and was a little unsure of how to answer. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing her tense look, Johnny knew he had guessed correctly, "No wonder they died in there." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia was stunned for a moment, surprised, looking at him, "You know Erebus well?" Johnny, who had his back leaning against the car seat, glanced at Amelia indifferently, "I've heard of it." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was the president of the Eurasian Union, how could he not know about Erebus? </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then do you know where Erebus is, and what it's like inside, and why some of the people who went in, some of them were able to come out, and some of them couldn't, and why on earth did they target S?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Faced with Amelia's barrage of questions, Johnny didn't answer, just stared at her </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>with a pair of deep blue eyes. "You want to go?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia, who had been read through her mind with a glance, had her heart tightened, but without changing her face, she shook her head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Johnny slightly turned his body sideways and looked Amelia's delicate and thin body up and down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"With a body like yours, it's better to stay home and be a canary." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The disdain and mockery in her tone made Amelia sound uncomfortable, she skimmed her mouth and no longer cared about Johnny. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Johnny, who was sitting next to her, looked at the silent Amelia for a few moments from time to time, wanting to say something but didn't know what to say, so he simply closed his mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The car suddenly plunged into an eerie and quiet atmosphere, Johnny began to be uncomfortable, because the small space, always attacked the woman's light fragrance, the aroma stirred his heart messy. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Brook." Just as he was about to sit down, Amelia suddenly opened her mouth. "Your sleeping pills, can I have some?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Johnny followed her line of sight to the sleeping pills laying on the storage box. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was bipolar and it was normal for him to take sleeping pills, but what was Amelia doing here?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What do you need sleeping pills for?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can't sleep at night."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Johnny stared at Amelia for a moment before reaching out with thin white fingers, picking up the box of pills and handing them to her. "You can only take one at a time."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Good." Amelia responded, adding a 'thank you'.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If there's nothing else, I'll head back." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What should be asked, was asked, Johnny had no reason to stay, he nodded his head </span><span>before opening the car door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia carried the medicine, quickly got out of the car, then followed Peter, back to his car, and quickly drove away from the hospital.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at the limousine, Johnny thoughtfully knocked on the edge of the window.</span></p></div>
