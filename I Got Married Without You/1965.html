        <h1>Chapter 1965 Marry in the Next Life</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the screen went dark, Anthony's heart quivered uncontrollably with pain, his mouth filling with blood and tears rolling down from the corners of his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His whole body ached, and although he had thought the pain of cancer might suppress the ache in his heart. As death neared, it was the heartache that felt more lethal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The doctor had given him three days, but by removing his tubes to see Edith one last time, he had reduced his life expectancy to a day...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He desperately wanted to see Edith before he died, but it was clear she wouldn't come. With no hope left, Anthony mustered his last bit of energy to send her a text.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His fingers were bloody, staining the phone and blurring the screen. Perhaps it was the disorientation, but despite the haze, he precisely found Edith's number and tremblingly typed the words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wasn't sure if he had hit send, only aware of a sudden blockage in his chest, choking his breath. Blood surged up his throat, spewing out of his mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The blood splattered on the screen...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony stared at his blood-soaked phone, despairingly pulled a smile, and then lay back on the couch, unconscious...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As his vision faded, he saw a young Edith running towards him with a smile...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anthony, after you graduate, will you marry me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony wanted to say "yes", but he couldn't utter a word. All he could do was part his lips, silently repeating, "Okay, once I graduate, I'll marry you..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't know when the hallucination vanished, only that as it faded, he murmured to the empty air, "Edith, in this life, I can't marry you, but in the next... is that okay?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But no one answered him. In the empty living room, he was utterly alone. As if abandoned by the whole world, alone in his arrival and alone in his departure...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emerging from the shower, Edith reached for her phone, glancing at the screen. It was a message from Anthony, containing just three simple words: [I love you.]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was nothing else. Edith stared at the message for a long while, then walked over to the floor-to-ceiling window, gazing out at the living room across the way, its lights always turned off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After much hesitation, she picked up her phone and replied: [Is your stomach ache any better?] In the past, Anthony would have responded immediately, either by texting back or knocking on her door. But after a long wait, there was no response.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Assuming he was asleep, Edith didn't worry further and put her phone away, heading back to bed. About two days later, the sound of sirens filled the neighborhood, stirring a sense of unease within Edith. Like everyone else, she went downstairs to see what was happening. She found herself facing the building opposite hers, watching as two policemen emerged from the elevator, pushing a gurney covered with a white sheet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her thoughts didn't initially turn to Anthony. But then, the man's hand slipped out from under the sheet, and she froze in place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After their breakup, Anthony, in an attempt to make up for not marrying her, used a small knife to carve a ring-shaped mark on his middle finger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After etching the mark, he held up his bloody hand and told her he regretted his actions, hoping she would give him another chance to rectify his past mistakes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Edith, having just crawled out of her emotional turmoil, had coldly rejected Anthony. She couldn't recall the look in his bloodshot eyes as he watched her walk away, but even after all these years, she still remembered that finger he had carved for her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With disbelief, she pushed through the crowd, crossed the police line, and approached the body covered by the white sheet. She tried to lift her trembling hand several times, lacking the courage to uncover the face. Finally, using her left hand for support, she slowly lifted the sheet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A face, pale and devoid of any color, was suddenly revealed before her eyes. Edith's fingers clutching the sheet stiffened, and a chill ran through her body as if her blood had turned to ice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She stared at that face for a long time, then, in utter disbelief, asked the policeman standing beside her, "Who is he?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The police's eyes widened in disbelief as he stared at the woman who had suddenly burst into tears upon asking the question. "If you don't know him, why did you lift the white sheet? Aren't you afraid of being cursed?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Edith stood there dumbfounded, shaking her head slowly. "I do know him," she whispered, her voice trembling. "He would never do anything foolish. That's why I can't believe it's him. Is it really him?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The police sighed heavily, "This renowned lawyer, Mr. Anthony Clark. He didn't commit suicide. He died from advanced cancer. It's a sad story. He'd been dead at home for two days before one of his students found him and called the police. Otherwise, no one would've come to collect his body..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dead at home for two days...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Edith's mind reeled as the words struck her like a bolt of lightning. She recalled two days ago when Anthony had called her, complaining of a stomachache and asking if she could check on him. Yet, she had angrily refused, still fuming over his recent act of peeping.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If she had gone to see him that night, maybe Anthony could still be alive. Or he could have been saved. But she hadn't gone. Not even when she received his text message did she bother to check on him...</span></p></div>
