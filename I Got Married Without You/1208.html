        <h1>Chapter 1208 James interfered with the appraisal report</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the dean's office, Amelia and James sat on the sofa, waiting for the appraisal results.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man's hand was holding hers tightly, and the warmth of his palm seemed to burn through her skin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though his appearance didn't show much emotional change, Amelia could feel that he was very nervous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's okay, don't be afraid."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She scratched his palm to signal him to relax, but he lowered his eyes and looked at Amelia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If Alice is indeed the adopted child of the Clark family, we are still cousins. What do you plan to do?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Herb said that one of the three sisters is not from the Clark family, so besides Sumasa, Ashley, and Jonny's mother Alice, there is a 30% chance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Amelia suspected that her mother was not from the Clark family, everything was unknown until the results came out. It was understandable that James was worried about this unknown factor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had thought about this question on the way to the hospital, whether she would abandon her moral principles for James.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The answer in her heart was that it was absolutely impossible for them to be biological siblings, but if they were cousins... she could try to accept it for him. After all, she couldn't live without him. But if they did that, they would never be able to have children...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia, who was hesitant for the sake of their child, didn't answer James&rsquo; question in time. James, who thought he knew her well, immediately let go of her hand and stood up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Where are you going?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"To the bathroom."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James quickly left the dean's office and found Stella, who was doing the appraisal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"CEO, the results haven't come out yet. Please don't worry."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing him rush in suddenly, she thought he was anxious for the results.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he didn't react much, walked up to her, and ordered coldly:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If the test results show a sibling relationship, you immediately change the report."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her gloved hands trembled as Stella looked up at James&rsquo; expressionless face in </span><span>disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Isn't that...not a good idea?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not a good idea?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not having Amelia is what's not a good idea.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wanted her to be his wife without any burden, so what if he used some dirty means?!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He admitted that his thoughts were indeed without bottom line, but so what?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all the hardships he had gone through to find her, he couldn't just give up because of something like this, could he?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You've done fake reports before, I believe it's not difficult."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>J</span><span>ames</span><span> left the testing department after dropping this sentence.</span></p></div>
