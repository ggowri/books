        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia watched Emily and felt a deep sadness for her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emily was living a life of luxury, and had she shown a bit of kindness, she could have been the happiest woman in the world. But she was fixated on what she couldn't have, and ultimately, she lost everything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Emily could realize this, she wouldn't blame Amelia for everything. But her obsession has cornered her to this point.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She couldn't understand why Matty went back on his promise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Emily wasn't stupid, and she soon figured it out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matty had laid down a condition - if they didn't mention James in front of Amelia, he would spare them. But this was just a ploy to keep them quiet so Amelia wouldn't turn against him for James.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once they complied, Matty manipulated the game. He gave them hints, helped them through the first six rounds, and when they let their guard down, he eliminated them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matty's motive must be Brandon's treatment towards his daughter and Amelia. After using them, he planned to eliminate them all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emily, who finally understood Matty's intentions, knew she was next. If she couldn't escape Matty's trap, she'd make him and Amelia enemies. If she couldn't live, she wouldn't let them live either.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With this in mind, Emily looked at the camera and began to speak. But the sound cut </span><span>off and Amelia couldn't hear her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's going on with these tech glitches?" a man in black complained while tapping away at a console.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia couldn't understand the code, so she just watched Emily closely on the monitor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she was about to go find out, a man in black exclaimed, "Oh no, another glitch!" Suddenly, the floor opened beneath Emily and she fell into a pit of snakes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What the hell are you doing?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia heard Matty's furious voice along with Emily's screams.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The terrifying screams reminded Amelia of something Emily had once said about karma hitting her unborn child.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She felt uneasy, and clutching her belly, she stood up and walked away, ignoring Matty's calls, walking quickly until she bumped into Dylan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since they'd entered Erebus, Dylan had become more reserved, his usually smiling face now serious. He had a lot on his mind but didn't show it in front of Amelia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You need to be careful, you're pregnant," he gently reminded her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm craving spicy </span><span>food,</span><span> can you get me some?" Amelia asked, trusting Dylan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Spicy food's not good for you, and Matty won't be happy if he finds out," Dylan replied, confused as Amelia usually preferred sour food.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I really want some now. You can get it for me and I'll eat it in the control room where Matty won't find us," Amelia suggested, grabbing Dylan's sleeve.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The control room had no surveillance and Amelia was clearly making an excuse to speak privately with Dylan. Dylan hesitated, remembering Matty's warning not to interfere.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing his hesitation, Amelia gently shook his sleeve, "Dylan, it's just some spicy food, can you help me out here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She needed to ask Matty why he had killed Emily secretly, especially after Emily had said something. She had a feeling Matty was hiding something.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The only place she could find answers was from Dylan, who had helped her before...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dylan."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her soft calls eventually melted Dylan's heart. "Alright, you go ahead. I'll find some spicy snacks and bring them to you."</span></p></div>
