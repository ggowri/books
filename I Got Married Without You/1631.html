        <h1>Chapter 1631 Paul wanted to tell the whole world</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon receiving a call from Paul, James, expressionless, extended his slender finger and pressed the end call button. Unwilling to accept being hung up on, Paul called again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James's face darkened as he answered the call. Without waiting for Paul to speak, a furious roar came from the other end: "Get lost!" One word shattered Paul's desire to share. After furrowing his brows in thought, he picked up his phone and sent a message to James.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"James, I'm at Eva's house and I have no clothes to wear. Can you bring a set for me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Glancing at the screen of his phone, James couldn't help but tighten his fist... Paul waited for a few minutes but didn't receive a response. He picked up his phone again and opened the family group chat, mentioning James.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"James, please look at my message."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James: ...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one replied, so Paul mentioned all members of the group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Please mention James for me, I need to talk to him urgently."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian asked with concern, "What's the urgent matter?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul, seeing someone respond, quickly typed, "I'm getting married."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Why does it concern James if he's getting married? Sebastian couldn't understand, but James did. He just wanted to show off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, Paul saw a message from James: "Remove Paul from the group."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the group admin, Rebecca seemed to sense James's speechlessness and considerately removed Paul from the group chat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Being kicked out of the group didn't bother Paul at all. After taking a selfie, he opened his Moments and posted a message, mentioning each member of the family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm getting married. Does anyone have a proposal plan? Please send it to me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the group without Paul, Christopher sent a message: "What's wrong with Paul?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian: "Did he take the wrong medication?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leonard: "Paul must have taken the wrong medication. Who would marry him?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even the usually invisible Miles joined in with a message: "If he can get married, I'll cut off my head and use it as a stool for him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James scrolled through the messages in the group, and Paul's call came in again...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, instead of hanging up, James calmly answered, "If it's not important, I'll break your legs."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feeling great, Paul didn't care about James's hostility and continued to show off, "James, I'm getting married."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James coldly responded, "So what?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul kicked the glass of the French window with his toe, "Can I borrow your Jmissa?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James's blue eyes turned icy, "If you want to die, just say so."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After thinking for a moment, Paul also realized it wasn't appropriate, "Forget it, your proposal venue is a bit shabby. I want to choose the best place for Eva, something she'll never forget."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, his intention wasn't to borrow the venue from James, but to let him know that he was proposing and that his proposal location and ceremony would be more grand than James's.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James couldn't help rolling his eyes, "Has Ms. Miller agreed?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This made Paul, who was uncertain, vague in his reply, "She kind of agreed."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, James knew Eva hadn't agreed. With a hint of mockery in his unfathomable gaze, he said, "You're making it public before she even accepts. Aren't you afraid of rejection?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Confidently patting his chest, Paul said, "No matter what, I will win her over this time. James, just wait for my good news!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James's lips curled up, a mischievous smile forming, "Have you informed your parents?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A seemingly casual remark instantly brought Paul, who had been showing off, back to reality. He no longer felt like bragging in front of James.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Staring at James's profile picture on the screen for a while, Paul gritted his teeth, "I'll go back tonight and let them know the good news."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James hadn't expected Paul to think this way. His lips curled up slightly, revealing a deeper smile. It seemed that Paul was serious this time. If he was willing to settle down and focus on his family, James would naturally be happy for him. However, Paul's parents would not make it easy for him, especially considering what Edith had gone through. Hopefully, they would let Paul off the hook...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While James considered things carefully, Paul's mind was still focused on showing off. "James, are you going to send the clothes or not? If not, I'll find Amelia."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man in the car raised his cold gaze and glanced at Paul, who was standing by the French window, wrapped only in a towel. "Dare you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul knew he was being scrutinized and twisted his muscular body, "Do you think I dare...?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now that he had a wife to support him, did he still fear James?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In reality, his wife was also afraid of James, but not Amelia.</span></p></div>
