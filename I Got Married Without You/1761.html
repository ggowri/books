        <h1>Chapter 1761 Babe, Come back home with me</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James didn't answer her, he just looked at her with red eyes. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia's hand moved away from his face and slowly touched his clothes. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the black textured shirt, there was a set of golden letters. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Erebus-Inviter-2-9. This meant that he had become a member of Erebus, with a higher level than the regular black-clothed people. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had joined the backstage of Erebus, at the same level as the one who invited her to Erebus 2-7. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had been in Erebus all along, watching her, but he only came now... </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia realized this, and tears in her eyes fell like broken beads. She grabbed James' clothes, tears streaming down her face, and stared at him. "Are you hurt somewhere? Can't go home, can't contact me, can't come see me?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those tears kept hitting James' heart, making it hard for him to breathe. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He raised his fingers and wiped the tears from her face, then shook his head gently. "No, I just broke my promise, I'm sorry." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia didn't believe him, she tried to touch his head, but he grabbed her wrist. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without explaining, James grabbed her hand and pulled her towards the door. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia followed, looking at the back of his head, there was no sign of a head injury. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia looked at James, who didn't say anything, and a fog of darkness covered her heart. James, as if he didn't have time for many words, quickly pushed her through the door and said one word. "Leave." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To Amelia, this word was as cold as the note that said "leave," making her feel cold all over. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia saw James walk away after pushing her through the door, she didn't even have time to feel heartbroken, she hurried over and threw herself into his arms, holding onto his strong waist. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Bbe</span><span>, I'm sorry, I wasn't questioning you just now, I just don't understand why you've been here all this time and only come to see me now. I was a little mad at you, but I didn't blame you. I know the way home is difficult, and I know you must have a reason for not being able to go back. Don't leave me alone, come home with me, okay?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her cheek pressed against his chest, feeling his warmth, hearing his heartbeat, and smelling his scent. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All the tension and longing of the past 150 days poured out, making her cry like a helpless child in his arms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The petite Amelia in his arms was the person James had been thinking about day and night, the person he had hurt over and over again, and now the person he had to let go of. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James' hand around her waist tightened uncontrollably, almost wanting to merge her into his bones, but it was only for a moment before he regained his composure. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Go quickly."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He forcefully pushed Amelia, shoving her through the door, and turned away again. Amelia rushed out, grabbing his wrist, her fingers a bit cautious. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wanted to hold his hand tightly but hesitated when she saw James's indifferent face. In this relationship, even in marriage, Amelia was filled with self-doubt and fear. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Many times, whenever James turned cold, she dared not approach him, dared not speak loudly, dared not get angry... </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She feared he would reject her as he did before. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tentatively, bit by bit, she tightened her grip on his arm. "Babe... Come back home with me."</span></p></div>
