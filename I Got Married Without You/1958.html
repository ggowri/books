        <h1>Chapter 1958 Call Her Grandma</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dylan's wedding was completely over, and Amelia stayed with Alexander and Grace in the Lawrence family for a few days before returning home.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everything returned to normal. Except that James and Alexander rarely talked to each other, life was going smoothly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>George, Neil, and Jocelyn occasionally came to visit Grace, so the three of them bonded and often met by chance. Later, they came to see Grace together.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Neil hadn't changed. He liked playing games, collecting gold, and living an undisciplined life. But such a self-indulgent man managed Aaron's and Skender's company very well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To avoid toing and froing between the two countries, Neil merged the two companies and had its office at the place where Skender and Aaron met and fell in love. It was renamed AS Construction. The company brochure represented the love story of two top designers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because of Neil's publicity, everyone learned about their story. Some people felt Aaron wasn't worth Skender's affection, while others felt sorry for Aaron. The two parties constantly argued, but no one could judge a relationship where the two of them fell in love with each other at different times.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for George, he left his job as a surgeon as he got older. After teaching his students all his skills, he lived a leisurely life of fishing, drinking coffee, and feeling the beauty of nature. The only constant was that he went to visit Grace with Neil and Jocelyn every year. George had never considered finding a partner, so he was carefree and would expect nothing else.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jocelyn was the most unfortunate among the three of them. She got cancer before she could watch Grace reach adulthood. She couldn't stand the chemotherapy and decided to euthanasia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Jocelyn died, she handed over all the properties of the Sherwood family and the Johnson family to Grace. At that time, Grace was only 12 years old, yet she was already the third wealthiest woman in Racria and had a prosperous life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the day of Jocelyn's euthanasia, Amelia took Grace to see her. Jocelyn, who was once arrogant, was tortured by the disease. Her hair fell out, and her face was covered with spots. She was scrawny.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Jocelyn learned that Grace would come, she put on makeup specially. However, no matter how heavy the makeup was, she couldn't hide the tiredness in her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite her awful look, Jocelyn forced a kind smile when she saw Grace. "Grace..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She offered her trembling hand and grabbed Grace's arm. "I did a lot of wrong things when I was young, hurting your mom and dad. I'm sorry for them, and I'm sorry for you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After those years of getting along, Grace no longer hated Jocelyn. Seeing that she was about to die, she couldn't help but feel sad. "I can't forgive you on behalf of my parents, but I can represent myself and say that I forgive you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Receiving Grace's forgiveness, Jocelyn burst into tears. "Grace, can you call me Grandma?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although she could feel that she had softened Grace every time she visited her over the years, Grace never called her Grandma but always called her Madam Sherwood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jocelyn never expected Grace to call her Grandma, but now that she was dying, she wanted to hear it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grace stared at Jocelyn's withered face and parted her lips, trying to say it, but for some reason, she couldn't get the word "grandma" out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon seeing that, Jocelyn didn't impose. She touched the back of Grace's hand and said, "It's okay. Don't force yourself."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, she managed to turn her gaze to Amelia and said, "Thank you for raising Grace so well."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Grace was with Casare, Grace played with knives and guns and knew about killing people. Fortunately, Amelia adopted her later. Otherwise, Grace wouldn't have been as tolerant of her as she was now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jocelyn was already grateful for Aaron's child being raised like this. She could leave without concerns.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After giving her last words, Jocelyn asked Amelia and Grace to leave. Then, the doctor went in. Within a few minutes, the doctor asked them in again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grace thought the doctor had been treating Jocelyn, but she didn't expect the doctor to give her euthanasia drugs. While she was waiting, Jocelyn passed away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Grace went in, she saw Jocelyn lying peacefully on the hospital bed without breath and couldn't help but cry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feeling sad, she ran over, knelt before Jocelyn's hospital bed, and grabbed her hand. She tried to say something, but no sound came out. Finally, she said in a trembling voice, "Grandma!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia didn't know if it was her illusion, but she saw a faint, relaxed smile on Jocelyn's lips when Grace called her Grandma. She seemed to let go of the past, so she left so peacefully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Some people said that hearing was the last thing a person lost after death. Jocelyn must have heard Grace call her Grandma so that she passed away with a smile. If so, it would not be too regretful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At Jocelyn's funeral, it was Grace who held the urn. She was buried at the Johnson family's cemetery, but it was far away from where Aaron and Skender were buried. This was what Jocelyn had asked before she died. She said she had disturbed the two of them too much during her lifetime and didn't want to bother them again.</span></p></div>
