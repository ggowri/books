        <h1>Chapter 1779 Don't die before you see 1-2</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sorry." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James, like an emotionless machine, with a blank expression, lowered his eyelids and stared at Carson. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I have to go to the upper area to open up 1-2's mind and install a chip in it." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But I don't have the permission, I can only borrow your iris and palm print." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Venom already guessed what he was up to and there was no way he would agree. "I only helped you kill Mr. Ben and </span><span>Emily,</span><span> I won't be a part of harming 1-2!" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carson struggled to break free, but found he couldn't open James, who seemed as immovable as a wall, gripping him tightly. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The programmers in the room, witnessing this scene, stood up one after another, but were silenced by a cold glance from James. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If any of you want him dead, just come over."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying this, James lowered his eyelids, concealing the coldness in his eyes, and a hint of a bloodthirsty smile slowly formed at the corner of his lips. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Venom, you have to come with me." James didn't care whether Venom agreed or not, he just dragged him and quickly headed to the exclusive passage to the upper area. Carson, through his mask, gave James a cold glance. "You can't beat 1-2." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How do you know if I don't give a try?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James grabbed his hand and placed it on the palm print scanner, after verifying the palm print, he removed Carson's mask. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The surveillance shows that I was threatening you, it won't cause you any trouble." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In addition to the palm print and iris, he also needed to scan his face and body, and the final step was a series of passwords. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James couldn't complete it by forcing Carson's head, he had to make him cooperate voluntarily, but how could Carson cooperate? </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I told </span><span>you,</span><span> I won't let anyone harm 1-2." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James didn't respond, just looked at Carson. "If you don't cooperate, I'll have to use force." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was a cold determination in his eyes, and a hint of stubbornness. He looked like a walking dead, driven by hatred, supporting his withered body. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His soul had already drifted away with his deceased wife, floating towards the vast sea. After gazing at James in silence for a few seconds, Carson broke free from his </span><span>grip, and stepped forward to scan his iris. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you want to go to your death, I won't stop you." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James was no match for 1-2, and he might be shot as soon as he entered the upper area. James didn't care, he had to find the mastermind and kill Emily. This was the only thing he could do in this world. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After doing all this, he would go to be with her. Forever, in hell. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After scanning his whole body and entering the password, the exclusive passage to the upper area opened instantly. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James walked in quickly, and Venom wanted to follow, but was stopped by James. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This has nothing to do with you." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Venom had turned against Mr. Ben and Emily because of his nephew and niece, it was a personal grudge, and the founders of Erebus wouldn't be too concerned. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Venom opened the permission and followed James to the upper area, it would be considered a betrayal, and if James failed, the founders of Erebus would never forgive Venom. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carson was well aware of this, but he followed just to see if he could save his life in a critical moment, after all, James was Amelia's husband. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, James clearly didn't want to involve him, so Carson slowly retracted his steps, for James, who had lost his wife, probably didn't want to live anymore, so let him face all the hatred alone. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Go on." Carson pulled out a gun from his waist and threw it to James. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James, taking the gun, looked up at him. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't die before you see 1-2." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carson left with these words, and James, holding the gun tightly, followed the exclusive passage to the upper area as it started up.</span></p></div>
