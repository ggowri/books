        <h1>Chapter 1857: Seeking a Breakthrough</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, putting that chip in James was a death sentence?" Paul said in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The doctors' silence only made him angrier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't care! </span><span>You're</span><span> top docs and we're paying. You need to fix James!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Evans, we can try, but it's risky. We don't recommend it," a doctor warned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No one's to discuss this," James suddenly said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"James, if they can't, we'll find others..." Paul started.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They found the virus. They're the best. Let's not make their job harder," James </span><span>interrupted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Having said that, he gestured for the doctors to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, they gathered their reports and scans, heading out. But the lead doctor turned back and cautioned James, "Mr. Evans, take care of your brain. Avoid overexertion and trauma. A second recurrence could be more than just a tumor. The risk of brain cancer is very high."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Freaking go already! You're cursing James with your incompetence!" Paul exploded again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The doctors understood his distress and left without further comment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After they left, Paul was at a loss while James remained stoic. He nudged Paul, who was on the verge of tears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How long can we extend the tracking and location systems?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If they couldn't remove it, they needed to extend the shutdown time of these systems for their next move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James wasn't concerned about his lifespan. He wanted revenge. Only then could he die with no regrets. Otherwise, Zack's death, all the members' deaths, and Amelia's suffering would have been in vain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at James, his eyes filled with hate, Paul slowly reeled in his emotions. His clenched hands on the table relaxed </span><span>and in that moment,</span><span> his eyes too were filled with rage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just give me one more day," he said. "I'll shut down these systems."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Back at the computer center, Paul was like a man possessed. He locked himself in, working non-stop, skipping meals and sleep, punching codes like a madman. After a day and night of hard work, he managed to shut down the tracking and location systems. But instead of taking a breather, he immediately started on cracking the bomb system.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, James was lost in thought, wondering how Matty planned to wipe them all out. He had to think from Matty's perspective, as their styles were different. If he were Matty, he would take advantage of the terrain, plant explosives around the perimeter of Erebus and blow them all up, instead of waiting for a suicide mission.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With this in mind, James knew he had to blow up the explosives at Erebus first before charging in, a task not too daunting for 'S'. But he couldn't be sure if the people in Erebus would leave early or if Matty would use Amelia as a human shield, causing the members of 'S' to turn their anger on her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Plus, if he couldn't disable the bomb system in his brain, his life would be in Matty's hands the moment he stepped into Erebus. The path to revenge was far from easy, but a fearless man like James wasn't easily deterred. He was determined, whether or not Paul could disable the bomb system, to strike back at Erebus within two days, giving Matty no time to rest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for Amelia, he had to find a way to get her safely out of Erebus before he went in. But how could he help her when she was trapped? James knew Amelia was trapped because he saw through Matty's intentions. Luckily, he knew Matty wouldn't harm Amelia and would even protect her, so he wasn't too worried.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The priority was to find a breakthrough, a way into Erebus to help Amelia escape. The </span><span>first person who came to James' mind was Carson. With that thought, James immediately pulled out his phone, quickly found Carson's number and called him. After explaining Matty's intentions with Amelia, he fell silent, waiting for a response.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After hearing everything, Carson looked apologetic. "I just received </span><span>orders,</span><span> Erebus is on lockdown. I can't get in..."</span></p></div>
