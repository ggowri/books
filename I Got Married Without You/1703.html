        <h1>Chapter 1703 The Lawrence family</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Neil visited the Lawrence family's construction site last time, it was Dylan who received him, so they naturally knew each other and shook hands easily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sorry to keep you waiting."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No problem."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dylan replied casually and then looked at Amelia standing next to Neil.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I didn't expect Miss Clark to look even better in person than in the photos."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A hint of admiration flashed in his eyes, but it quickly disappeared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was Amelia's first time meeting Dylan in person and formally assessing him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dylan looked really good, with outstanding features that complemented his perfect face shape. His fair skin made him look regal and dignified.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Apart from his looks, he had a graceful and elegant demeanor. Every movement he made exuded charm, like a heir from a well-bred family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You have more charisma in person too."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia complimented him, and Dylan smiled, extending his hand towards her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's formally introduce ourselves. I'm Dylan."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia also shook his hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm Skender."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dylan nodded politely, released her hand, and invited her and Neil to get in the car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Normally, a family like his would have a driver, but Dylan personally drove without any airs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My grandfather is strict with us. He taught us from a young age to be low-key and not too extravagant. So, for things within our capability, we usually do them ourselves."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After explaining this, Dylan glanced at Amelia and smiled. "Although I didn't hire a driver, it doesn't mean the Lawrence family can't afford the design fees."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His relaxed and humorous tone eased the tension in Amelia, who was pretending to be Skender.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're joking. I know very well about your family's wealth and status."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dylan continued, "I assume Miss Clark has already researched my family before coming, so I won't introduce myself further."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia nodded lightly and didn't respond. Dylan then asked, "Is this your first time in England?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, it is. I've never been here before."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dylan looked at her and then opened the car windows and sunroof.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Feel the breeze and enjoy the scenery. We'll be at my house soon."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His attentive care towards women seemed to be something he had grown up with. Dylan's grandfather, Matty, must have been a kind old gentleman as well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dylan's car moved slowly on the wide road, surrounded by lush trees, with the </span><span>refreshing scent of nature filling the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia couldn't help but turn her head to look at the flowers and trees outside the window. Occasionally, she glanced at the rearview mirror, following their black luxury car closely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dylan noticed and asked, "Why didn't you bring your friend with you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked at Amelia teasingly, "Are you afraid the Lawrence family will eat people?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia felt a bit embarrassed that he had found out, but she quickly responded, "You know I rarely go out to survey construction sites myself. Occasionally, when I do, it's natural to be cautious about dangers."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't mention who was following them but only implied that there was a risk, showing her prudence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Dylan didn't mind, "For a renowned architect like Miss Clark, it's indeed necessary to hire bodyguards."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia smiled and replied, "Safety first, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dylan returned the smile and didn't say anything more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, the car passed through several European-style towns and stopped in front of a European-style estate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a bit secluded, but the scenery was beautiful. There was a stream in front of the estate, and on the opposite side, there was a lush green hill.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The bright sun shone down, casting a golden light. The blue sky and white clouds, purified by the light, added a touch of freshness to the scenery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The estate, nestled in such a picturesque setting, was neither big nor small, just as Dylan had described, low-key yet not overly luxurious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Amelia got out of the car and looked around, Dylan introduced, "This is where my grandfather's first love used to live. After retiring, he moved here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia's gaze shifted to Dylan, who was leading them towards the lawn. "Your grandfather's first love, is she your grandmother?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dylan shook his head. "My grandmother passed away a long time ago."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia was briefly stunned. That meant the person Matty cherished wasn't his wife, but his former first love.</span></p></div>
