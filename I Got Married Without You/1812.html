        <h1>Chapter 1812 Matty went to see Amelia</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia left the airport and returned to the pre-marital villa, sitting at the desk, contemplating her and James' next steps. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She couldn't come up with anything, so she messaged Andrew to ask if he had found the address, to which Andrew replied that he hadn't found it yet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As time passed, Amelia became increasingly worried about James' safety, especially after Gigi's ordeal, leaving her feeling uncertain. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, she felt she had a bit more rationality than Gigi, perhaps due to her experiences, and her ability to cope with the situation was better than before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While Amelia was lost in thought at her desk, there was a knock at the door. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was the Lawrence family's three brothers coming to see her, asking if she had made a decision. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia still refused, and the Lawrence family's three brothers didn't say much, only asking her to rest well. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the next day, they sent people to deliver various items, including luxury goods and supplements. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Owen's wife came and personally cooked for her. She even brought her and Owen's child to keep Amelia company.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When she was still hesitant, the patriarch of the Lawrence family came in person. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't bring any gifts like the others, only the Lawrence family's shares. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked just as he did when they first met, with white hair and a white suit, appearing radiant and not at all like a man in his seventies. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing the imposing and spirited old man in front of her, Amelia still respected him and welcomed him into the house, serving him tea.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I actually don't like tea," said the old man, causing Amelia's fingers to pause as she was brewing the tea. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She glanced at him with clear eyes. "I only have tea at home," she replied. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matty, feeling a bit choked, picked up the tea cup and took a sip, then proceeded to inspect her house. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The style is nice, but compared to the courtyard you designed yourself, it lacks a bit of warmth."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia didn't respond and continued to brew the tea. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matty put down the teacup and looked at Amelia. "I plan to have you live in that courtyard. When your child is born and grows up, I will take him fishing by the river. What do you think?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia took a pinch of tea leaves with the tweezers and put them in the teapot, then looked up at Matty. "I don't like it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it were the Lawrence family's three brothers, daring to speak to him like this, Matty would have been angry long ago. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, seeing the face that resembled Sophia's, he unexpectedly smiled. "You're quite similar to your grandmother, always ready to argue with me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Maybe that's because you're not very likeable," Amelia retorted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And what would make me likeable?" he asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This question left Amelia at a loss for words. "Why don't you like me?" Matty asked again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How do you know I don't like you?" she replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can see it in your eyes," Matty said, full of authority, gazing at Amelia, who was avoiding eye contact.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why?" he asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There's no reason," she replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She felt there was no need to hide her dissatisfaction in front of Matty, so she raised her head again. "You can't marry Sophia, yet you let her get pregnant, then turn around and engage in a business marriage. Have you ever considered her and your child?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Matty hadn't done this, her mother wouldn't have died in the street. Ultimately, it was Matty's inaction that led to the tragic lives of the next generation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, you're blaming me," Matty said, his aged eyes filled with regret as he looked back on the past. "It's my fault. I thought I could remarry her after my divorce, but I forgot that Sophia is a very strong-willed person."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He also shouldn't have hurt her first love, but when he was young, he set his sights on her among so many women. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He loved her very much, so naturally, he had to win her over. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Later, Sophia fell in love with him, even deeply, but she couldn't get over her guilt about her first love, and she left him with their child.</span></p></div>
