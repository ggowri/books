        <h1>Chapter 1758 Round eight</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia had a good night's sleep and felt pretty good the next day, not as nervous when facing the game. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The eighth round of the game was different from the previous ones. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was an extra screen on the wall with a deck of 54 cards. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Two players, please pick any card now," the voice said. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia and </span><span>Johnny</span><span> didn't know what to do, so they looked at each other. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Maybe we have to flip the same cards and pick more cards," </span><span>Johnny</span><span> suggested. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia agreed and they both went to the screen to select a card. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia chose an Ace and </span><span>Johnny</span><span> chose a 2. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were four of each card, so the odds were slightly better, but Erebus didn't play by the rules. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After they made their selections, all 54 cards on the screen flipped over, and the original order was instantly scrambled and kept rolling in all directions. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Two players, please draw the card you selected earlier, the number and suit must match," the voice said. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia had carefully noted the suit when making her selection, but with 54 cards, how could they pick the right one in five minutes? </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's a blind pick no matter what, just go with your gut and pick one," </span><span>Johnny</span><span> said. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His calm demeanor seemed to rub off on Amelia, and she wasn't as nervous anymore. </span><span>Johnny</span><span> stood by, ready to take the punishment if Amelia chose wrong. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had promised to help her make it to the ninth round. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only then would she have a chance to see the man in black. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If James was still alive, he would definitely come to see Amelia. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unless he didn't want her anymore. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Johnny</span><span> didn't tell Amelia about this possibility, he just let her choose first. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia stared at the constantly rolling cards on the screen, trying to find a pattern, but there was none. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The cards were all randomly rolling, and with the same back color, how could she </span><span>know which one it was? </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was very anxious, and when she was anxious, her lower abdomen couldn't stop hurting, but she had no choice but to endure it. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just pick one, don't be afraid," </span><span>Johnny</span><span> said, grabbing her hand. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia glanced at him and said, "You go first." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Johnny</span><span> shook his head and said, "Ladies first." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the ticking countdown, Amelia gritted her teeth and clicked on one of the face-down cards. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After she clicked, the card quickly flipped over. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When she saw the number on it, she remembered James before he left. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said, "Wait for me." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She only now realized how difficult the road back was. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia stared at the 3 on the screen, closed her eyes in resignation. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She quietly waited for death to come, but her wrist was suddenly grabbed by </span><span>Johnny</span><span>. "Don't take the punishment for me!" she shouted, but she didn't have the strength, and he pulled her away. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia rushed forward but hit the glass door. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A transparent door descended between them, followed by a red line aimed at </span><span>Johnny</span><span>'s chest&mdash; </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No!" Amelia pounded on the glass, screaming his name. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the red line, without any emotion, pierced </span><span>Johnny</span><span>'s heart. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Johnny</span><span>!" His blood splattered on the glass, blurring Amelia's vision. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She cried and reached out, using her sleeve to wipe the glass, but how could she clean the blood inside? </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia knelt down and looked at </span><span>Johnny</span><span> lying in a pool of blood. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The </span><span>Johnny</span><span> who had just smiled at her was now as pale as death, with no color in his face. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing him like this, Amelia cried uncontrollably. "</span><span>Johnny</span><span>, you said that after the eighth round, you would ask me a question, you haven't asked yet, how can you leave first?" Hearing Amelia's crying, </span><span>Johnny</span><span> slowly smiled. "I asked you last night while you were asleep." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia clenched her fists and hit the glass door. "I didn't hear it, </span><span>Johnny</span><span>, I didn't hear it!" "Get up and ask me again, okay?" The </span><span>blood stained</span><span> </span><span>Johnny</span><span>'s white shirt, but he smiled. "It doesn't matter..." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It does matter, </span><span>Johnny</span><span>, get up and ask me again, I won't sleep, I'll answer your question properly." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Johnny</span><span> looked at Amelia, who was crying with red eyes, and smiled again. "I left some food in the drawer for you..." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Amelia heard this, she cried even harder. "</span><span>Johnny</span><span>..." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before </span><span>Johnny</span><span> closed his eyes, he moved his lips again. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was speaking silently, but Amelia didn't see it, as the blood on the glass blocked her view. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia lunged to ask again, but a white wall descended, forever blocking her view&hellip;</span></p></div>
