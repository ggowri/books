        <h1>Chapter 1595 The remitter</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The food arrived quickly at the restaurant, and as they ate, they continued chatting and ended up talking about past events. Stella wasn't originally planning to ask, but after hearing Mason mention what happened to the people who had bullied her after they were released from prison, she couldn't help but ask, "They were just small-time troublemakers, so how did they manage to thrive overseas? Did they get into some big business?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mason replied, "Those guys didn't get involved in any big business. After they got out of prison, it was like they hit the jackpot or something. Suddenly, they became rich and all immigrated abroad. They didn't do any business at all; instead, they spent their days partying and having fun. It's unclear where the money came from."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the night of Stella's incident, a few individuals fell into the water while trying to escape and died on the spot. The others, although later sent to prison by Karen, suddenly became wealthy after their release. Stella's hand holding the fork trembled, "So where are these people now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking that Stella wanted to confront them, Mason quickly replied, "They're long gone. Some died at sea, some were killed in gambling disputes, and some were hit by cars. None of them had a good ending. It's like karma caught up with them."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mason always believed that bad deeds would be met with consequences, it was just a matter of time. After hearing about the fate of those people, he didn't think much of it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But for Stella, it raised many suspicions. Why did they suddenly become rich, and why did they suddenly meet unexpected deaths? It sounded as if someone was afraid they knew some secret and had bribed them, only to slowly silence them so no one would suspect a thing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stella lowered her eyelashes and pondered for a few seconds before raising her gaze to Mason, who was still eating, "How do you know all this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without lifting his head, Mason replied, "I was in the same country as them. After their incident, it made the local news. How could I not know..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With confirmation, Stella's heart sank even further. She suddenly remembered the doubts she had before. If Erin had a slight liking for her back then, why would she send people to rape her? Even if Erin was furious, she couldn't do such a thing, especially considering Erin's possessiveness...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking of this, Stella abruptly stood up, "Mason, I'm sorry, but I have something urgent to take care of. Let's reschedule our meal another time..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mason was still chewing his food, and seeing Stella in a rush with her bag, he wanted to talk to her but found it inconvenient. He could only nod and wave goodbye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stella went straight to the Evans' and asked Andrew for help in investigating the bank records of those people who had bullied her in the past after their release from prison. Andrew didn't understand why Stella wanted to look into this. Those rapists had fled to Singapore out of fear of retaliation from the Simpson family. Andrew had planned to go and kill them, but Stella believed they were merely following Erin's orders, so she let it go and didn't pay them any further attention. Now, why suddenly investigate them? Did her cousin still seek revenge?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stella didn't explain further and just told him to hurry and check. Andrew went to the bank, and he was quite efficient in his work. Stella only waited for a short while before Andrew returned with the information. When he saw Stella, his face was solemn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How did it go? Who sent them the money?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Andrew didn't reply but instead handed the documents to Stella with a cold expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stella, feeling anxious, quickly took the documents and flipped through them. These transfers went through multiple bank accounts before reaching the accounts of those individuals who were released from prison. It was evident that they had taken precautions to avoid detection.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, even with such complex and intricate operations, Andrew managed to trace the source of the funds...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Stella reached the name of the sender, her face turned pale, and her fingers holding the documents couldn't stop trembling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bart - Karen's cousin.</span></p></div>
