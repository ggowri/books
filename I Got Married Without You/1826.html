        <h1>Chapter 1826 It was her turn to protect him</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia's attempt to test the waters made it clear that Matty was not willing to release James. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Matty was unwilling to release James because he knew James's identity, then James was in great danger. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking about this, Amelia felt very uncomfortable. She pressed her hand against her chest, where her heart was racing, and looked up at the inscrutable Matty. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then she got up and walked to the bookshelf, took out the family tree again, turned to the page with their names, and made a motion to tear it up in front of Matty. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What are you doing?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matty immediately rushed over to take the family tree from Amelia's hands, but she evaded him. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Holding the family tree, she took two steps back, her clear eyes moving away from Matty's face, looking at the nobles still in the garden. "You must disband Erebus immediately, or I will inform </span><span>everyone</span><span> of your identity." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since Matty did not agree to release James, she decided to force him. Matty secretly established Erebus and wore a mask, indicating that those around him, including the Lawrence family, were unaware. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If she guessed correctly, both uncles, as well as Owen and Eugene, were unaware, and only Dylan, who worked with him, was aware. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had something on her that she didn't know, and she had something on him, so at this point, she could only hope that Matty would choose the lesser of two evils. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matty seemed surprised by Amelia's boldness, as she used this matter to threaten him. </span><span>"Amelia, I haven't avenged your grandmother yet, how could I disband Erebus?" "Besides, in Erebus, apart from my revenge, other manipulators also want to avenge S's members." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We are doing legitimate work, not playing around, how can we disband just like that?" Matty, seeing that she was his granddaughter, held back his anger, as he would have shot anyone else who dared to threaten him. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Also, you don't need to use my identity as a threat, with my current status, ability, and power, no one will believe what you say." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matty was right, using this as a threat would have little effect, as a single gold leaf could not represent anything. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After thinking for a moment, Amelia picked up the pace and returned to the desk, picked up the gold leaf, and turned to face Matty again. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll take a step back, and you take a step back, and give me the position of 1-1, so I can enter Erebus as a manipulator." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matty chuckled at her suggestion. "Are you joking?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia, however, stared at him intently. "I'm not joking. If you can't do it, then from now on, you and I are not relatives, but enemies." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matty knew she wanted to go in and find James, but James now... </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Amelia saw him in a half-dead state, she would surely hate herself. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't want his newly found relative to become an enemy because of an outsider. But what was he afraid of? Matty had plenty of means to bury all secrets in the soil.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can agree to your request, but from now on, you must stay with the Lawrence family and be a good granddaughter to me." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His intention was to allow her to release James on her own, but to confine her own freedom. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia lowered her long eyelashes and looked at the gold leaf in her hand, hesitating for a long time before nodding slowly. "Brandon harmed my mother and pushed me into the sea. Tomorrow, I will go to Erebus as 1-1 and deal with them. Take me there." Tomorrow... </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wasn't giving him any time. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If her husband was not James, she would have been just as good as Dylan. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matty admired her a bit and smiled at Amelia. "Okay, I'll take you tomorrow." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a clear answer, Amelia put away the gold leaf. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She could immediately find the location of Erebus, take revenge, and tell James who the founder of Erebus was. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James's task was to find out who the founder of Erebus was, and what to do next was Master Davies's business. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now she knew more than James, so he could finish the task earlier and come home sooner. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had never done anything for James, as he had always protected her, so this time... it was her turn to protect him.</span></p></div>
