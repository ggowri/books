        <h1>Chapter 1751 Community of interests</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Venom didn't care either, now that 2-9 had revealed their true selves in front of him, it meant that they were about to become a community of interests.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking of this, Venom tapped his cigarette in the ashtray.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"One last round, until he safely leaves," he said, referring to Johnny's safety, not hers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cobra hesitated for a few seconds before moving his fingers on the table.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Can I have access to the surveillance of the player's room?" They, as the behind-the-scenes invitees, did not have access to the surveillance of the player's room at all times. They could only see it during the beginning of the game, and it was closed at other times.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The programmer who took the blame for you today has been killed by 1-2," Venom said, throwing away his cigarette and taking off his mask.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't want to let innocent programmers get involved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cobra's furrowed brow relaxed slightly. "Thank you," he said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Venom blew a smoke ring and looked at him through the smoke. "What's your relationship with that woman?" he asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cobra didn't answer, showing a hint of indifference in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Venom, with a cigarette in his mouth, stared at him and sneered. "You're asking for my help, yet you're so stubborn."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cobra's long eyelashes drooped slowly. "I'll do anything you ask, but don't ask about </span><span>my personal life."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just tell me, is she Sumasa's daughter?" Venom asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You already knew, that's why you helped her, right?" Venom did indeed know that Amelia was Sumasa's daughter because he had accidentally seen her face on the deserted island.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You knew and still brought them in, not a good move," Cobra complained.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Venom smirked. "You're new here, what do you know?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was his duty to bring back all the invited people who voluntarily went to Erebus. And in Johnny's case, he had to give him the gold leaf because he needed to pay the price for his recklessness, otherwise he would never learn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't mess with the game area's program, 1-2 is a lunatic, if you provoke him, you'll all die," Venom warned as Cobra left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cobra glanced back at him before leaving without saying anything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cobra instinctively clenched his palm, but did not give a positive response. He only pulled open the door handle and quickly left.</span></p></div>
