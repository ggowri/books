        <h1>Chapter 1624 Take you home</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva raised her chin slightly and leaned in close to Paul's eyelids.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What do you mean by 'actual action'?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a fresh and comfortable scent, mixed with a hint of alcohol, as she got closer, it sprayed out, causing Paul's heart to race and making him unable to look directly into Eva's eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had intended to make a move, but when Eva actually approached him, he was scared and turned his head slightly, trying to avoid close contact.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva, who was held in his arms, couldn't see clearly who was in front of her. She grabbed his arm, squinted her eyes, and slowly approached him...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as she leaned in, Paul stopped avoiding her. He straightened his stiff back and stared at her, watching as she put her hand on his chest. His heart suddenly skipped a beat, but he remained calm and looked at her...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Eva's fingers curled up, she grabbed Paul's white shirt and with a slight force, she pulled the person in front of her closer...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmm? What actual action?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her seductive red lips were already close to his thin lips, only three centimeters away. Just a little closer and they would touch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul lowered his gaze, staring at those lips that opened and closed, and his prominent Adam's apple bobbed uncontrollably.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If I tell you, will you do it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva, unusually obedient, nodded. In fact, she was just drunk. Whatever others told her to do, she would do it without any precautions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the semi-drunk and semi-awake Eva in front of him, Paul hesitated for a while and then boldly leaned his face closer, "Kiss me to show your gratitude."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at the small white face so close, Eva let go of the shirt she was holding, reached towards his face, and gently kissed his handsome face...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was just a lipstick mark, but it felt like a branding iron, leaving a tingling sensation on Paul's heart, which suddenly spread throughout his body...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't help but tighten his hands, which were hooked around Eva's waist. As he did so, Eva fell into his embrace...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps the position was uncomfortable. Eva struggled to get up and Paul stared at her. After watching for a while, he suddenly picked her up in a princess carry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Being held like this while being drunk, Eva's head instantly spun. She felt extremely uncomfortable. The hand that was resting on Paul's neck slid up to the back of his head and grabbed his hair, pulling it down forcefully...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Put me down!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul's scalp instantly tingled, and any thoughts he had of doing something were instantly dismissed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What is she doing? At such an ambiguous moment, she's actually grabbing his hair?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul was speechless and followed the force of Eva's hand, tilting his head back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Eva, let go."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She pulled harder, and the thick hair at the back of his head was about to be pulled out </span><span>by her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva ignored his advice and continued to pull.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Put me down!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If I put you down, how can I take you home?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was swaying and couldn't even walk properly. Did she have to sleep in the nightclub again?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With his tall and slender neck, Paul stared at the drunken woman in his arms, who was jumping up and down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Behave, or I'll throw you on the ground!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as Eva heard that he was going to throw her to the ground, she instantly stopped moving. She lifted her innocent and aggrieved pair of watery eyes and looked at Paul...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing her becoming docile, Paul softened again, holding the woman tightly in his arms. "Be good, let go of your hand. I'll take you home, okay?"</span></p></div>
