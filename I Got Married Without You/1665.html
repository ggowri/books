        <h1>Chapter 1665 Be brave once again</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva wanted to say that she didn't love Paul, but she liked him. However, as she started to speak, she hesitated. If she didn't love him, why did she care so much about him being with other women? She used to not care about these things.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing that Eva herself didn't even realize whether she loved him or not, Ryan's eyes softened with a hint of a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Eva, sometimes when it comes to relationships, don't be too afraid. If you have feelings for each other, be brave once again." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva used to be the type of person who would love fearlessly, but after experiencing her ex-husband's betrayal and encountering the unreliable Paul, she became hesitant in matters of the heart. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But in Ryan's eyes, any relationship that is worth both parties' efforts </span><span>is</span><span> worth being brave for. If it were him, he wouldn't have any reservations and would start anew. </span><span>However</span><span>...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't have the chance to start anew.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva, who didn't realize what Ryan was thinking, tightly clenched her fists and for the first time, opened up about her feelings in front of someone else.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I have been </span><span>brave</span><span> before, but when I took that step, I discovered that he did something to hurt me. I retreated, became afraid, and decided to never interact with him again. But today, he tells me that what I saw was all staged and he even brought that woman to explain it to me. I don't know if I should continue to trust him." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ryan understood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What he did in the past made you feel insecure, so you lack trust in him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Actually, it doesn't matter what the situation is. The crucial point is the label that Paul carries, which makes Eva, who has stumbled in marriage before, unwilling to give her all. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The reason she is like this is because she loves Paul. If it were someone else, like Jayden, Eva wouldn't care if Jayden had been with other women and wouldn't be bothered by it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, what he did in the past really makes it hard for me to believe him..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After thinking for a moment, Ryan looked at Eva, who had no sense of security.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Has he changed for you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva carefully thought about it, Paul's changes, from being a smooth playboy to a jealous rich young man. He not only made her jealous by seeing other women, but he also occasionally insulted her with his words. The only other change was that he seemed to have fallen in love with her, but it must be said that he had matured quite a bit after her accident...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If he is willing to change for you, then give him another chance to prove it. If you find out that he's not worth it, then give up. But the prerequisite is that you have to try to know the result, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Eva silent, Ryan shared his perspective.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva, who took in Ryan's words, looked down at the ring on her hand with lowered eyebrows.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Maybe you're right."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing this, Ryan knew that she had made up her mind. He smiled and picked up the book that he had never turned a page in, lowering his head to read.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Ryan reading the book again, Eva knew that he was being controlled by depression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She stopped peeling the apple in her hand, stood up, and patted Ryan's shoulder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ryan, when you can stand up again, there will definitely be a group of girls chasing after you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ryan shifted his gaze away from the book and, with a faint smile, looked at Eva.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"At my age, I shouldn't cause trouble for those girls."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said it cheerfully, but in his deep eyes, there was only despair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even if you're older, you deserve to be liked by someone else."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These heartwarming words made Ryan feel the power of companionship, but he still wanted to be alone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Eva, I feel like having pumpkin congee today. Can you do me a favor and make some for me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only then did Eva raise her wrist and check the time on her watch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Look at me, I almost forgot about it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She put on her jacket while instructing Ryan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just wait a moment, I'll be right back."</span></p></div>
