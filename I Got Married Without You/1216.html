        <h1>Chapter 1216 Borrow Herb’s hair</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man who was "annoyed" tilted his head slightly, and a cold light burst out of his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Herb saw this and swallowed hard, feeling strange. He had seen James before and wasn't afraid, so why did he feel like he was being overwhelmed this time?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just like when Jonny gets angry, he can't help but feel scared...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Herb, who couldn't figure it out, scratched the back of his head and changed the subject, "Um...sister, did you invite me to meet you to decide to go back to England with me and see my aunt for the last time?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After shaking her head, Amelia explained her purpose, "I came to find you to borrow a strand of hair..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Herb was at a loss, "I can understand if you borrow money because of an unhappy marriage, but I really don't understand why you would borrow a strand of hair?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His previous sentence was a sarcasm towards James, and Amelia heard it. She thought Herb was very bold and not afraid of being beaten, "I want to borrow your hair to do a DNA test."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Herb understood with an "Oh," but said, "You look just like my little aunt. You're </span><span>obviously a member of our Clark family. There's no need to test it, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia continued, "There are many people in the world who look alike. You can't say that just because you look alike, you must be your little aunt's daughter. It's more reliable to do a test, otherwise I won't believe it..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Herb nodded, "Okay, you can take my hair to do the test. But after the test, will you go to England with me to see my aunt?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia didn't even blink when she lied, "If the identification is from your family, it's only right for me to go and see the deceased for the last time. If it's not, then I won't go. Is that okay?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Herb was delighted when Amelia agreed to go to England and patted his chest, "Don't worry, you must be a member of our Clark family..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After speaking, he glanced at James, who was standing like a statue beside him, "But you married an enemy of the Clark family. We definitely won't agree to it. When the results come out, can you divorce him?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man leaned back in his armchair and cracked his knuckles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing the sound of the joints cracking, Herb swallowed a mouthful of saliva.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia was dismissive and waved his hand, "Let's talk about it later. Let's do the identification first."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Herb thought about it and didn't want to rush things. After she saw his aunt, he would take her back to the C family. When she felt the warmth of her family, she would consider divorcing James. So he relaxed and said, "Okay, let's wait until the identification is done."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Amelia nodded, she reached out her hand to him, "Give me the hair..."</span></p></div>
