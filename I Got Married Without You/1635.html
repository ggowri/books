        <h1>Chapter 1635 Marrying her might invite ridicule</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kate and Eric had seen Paul's tweet and they weren't surprised when he returned. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Edith had a falling out with both of them, but not Paul. Even if he did, when it came to marriage, he still needed to inform his parents.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Paul returned, without saying a word, Eric and Kate acted as if they didn't know anything and instructed the servants to prepare dinner and tea. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After exchanging a few words in the living room, they moved to the dining table. It was then that Paul spoke up, "Mom, Dad, I'm getting married. Can you help me prepare?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unlike James, Paul had his parents around, so these matters had to be handled by them. At least when it came to engagement, both husband and wife had to personally go, showing their importance to Eva. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul knew this, which was why he came back to inform them. However, Eric and Kate glanced at each other and it was Kate who spoke up in the end, "Who are you marrying?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Actually, they knew very well that Paul had a girlfriend a few years ago who was three years older than him. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were together for quite a long time, about three years, and even after they broke up, they were still entangled. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The last time Paul got drunk in the middle of the night and crashed into Johnny's car was because of that woman. Later, he was even provoked by that woman's boyfriend...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eric and Kate didn't ask about these things, but that didn&rsquo;t mean they didn't know anything. It was precisely because they knew everything that they were very unhappy about their son's marriage. However, they took Edith's situation as a lesson and even though Kate, who had been tough on her, was dissatisfied, she put on a smiling face instead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul glanced at Kate and could tell right away that his mother was fake smiling. "Her name is Eva, she's the person I love the most in my life, and the person I must marry." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying that, he looked at his parents, "You must have already investigated her, so there's no need to ask. I came back today just to let you know that I'm going to marry her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Actually, Eric didn't care that much about his children's marriages. As long as they liked the person, it was fine. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Kate was different. She cared about social status and the other person's character. After investigating Eva, she naturally felt that there were some problems with her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing that their son was determined to marry her, Kate changed her tough attitude towards Edith and spoke softly, "I've heard about Ms. Miller. If you like her, I won't stop you. But son, she only graduated from high school, has been married before, and runs an entertainment venue. </span><span>Marrying her might invite ridicule</span><span>."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who would dare to ridicule me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul's face darkened, and his eyes, like a thundercloud, stared at Kate, "Are you judging her based on these one-sided things?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kate remained calm and smiled, "I haven't had much contact with her, so I can only judge her based on these one-sided pieces of information."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul's face turned cold, "It's true that she only graduated from high school, has been married before, and runs a nightclub. But so what? I love her, whether she's a rich lady, a commoner, or a beggar on the street, if I say I want to marry her, then I will!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kate tightened her hand under the table, "Paul, she has already been divorced once. How is she worthy of you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul didn't mind at all, "Whether she's been divorced or not, what does it have to do with me wanting to marry her?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul was much more determined than Edith. Kate, who felt her heart tightening, no longer insisted and only asked, "You absolutely have to marry her?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without any hesitation, Paul nodded, "Once I propose, I'll take you to meet her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He really just came to inform them. After saying that, he wanted to get up and leave, but Eric stopped him, "Paul, look at how arrogant you are. Do you have any respect for us?"</span></p></div>
