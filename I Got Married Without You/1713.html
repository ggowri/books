        <h1>Chapter 1713 Impending separation</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia cried herself to sleep under his comforting embrace. In her dream, James passed by her with blood all over him, and she desperately tried to grab onto him, but couldn't reach his clothes...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She woke up from a nightmare, and as soon as she opened her eyes, she didn't see James. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her heart sank, was it really that fast? Did he leave so quickly without even saying goodbye or giving her a hug?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"James!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wasn&rsquo;t he supposed to leave in ten days? How did he disappear so quickly?!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia was so anxious that she threw off the covers and quickly got out of bed. Before her feet even touched the ground, a handsome man with a graceful demeanor </span><span>walked in from outside and swiftly came to her side. He reached out and caught her foot, then helped her back onto the bed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The ground is cool."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as Amelia heard his voice and saw him, her heart, which had been hanging in her throat, finally relaxed. But when she reached for the milk in his hand, all her emotions came to a sudden halt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia instinctively looked down at her pants, they had already been changed...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She only just realized that she had started her period, her face instantly turning red. "Did you... help me change?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James seemed unfazed and nodded, "You were sleeping so soundly, I didn't want to disturb you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia blushed and was surprised that James, who had a cleanliness obsession, would personally do such a thing. "Please don't do this again, just wake me up next time."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't care, picked up the milk and scooped a small spoonful, handing it to her lips. "Finish this and then I'll carry you downstairs."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every time Amelia had her period, James always prepared a lot of supplements for her. No matter how busy he was, would will stay by her side and watch her finish eating them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia was well taken care of by him, with plump cheeks that could be pinched and rosy skin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for himself, his stomach had never been good, and he couldn&rsquo;t eat a lot of things, so he looked a bit thin. But Amelia always found ways to cook for him herself, and even if James didn&rsquo;t feel like eating, he would finish everything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though he didn't gain weight, James remained strong and sturdy. The only regret was that both he and his wife were trying to improve their health, but Amelia still couldn't get pregnant...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia was disappointed once again by her period, and James could sense her sadness. After her period ended, they spent every day in bed together.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He kept her locked in the room every day, not allowing her to draw or go outside. He himself never went out either, repeatedly wanting her in this way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia knew that James didn't just want to have the baby, but he also had mixed feelings about their </span><span>impending separation</span><span>, which was why he poured his reluctance into her body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though Amelia was exhausted, she still endured the joy he brought, because she couldn't bear to let go.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One last time, on the day before James was about to leave, she lay on top of him and buried her head in his neck. "James, you know I love you, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man behind her waist paused for a moment, but didn't say anything. He just put his hands away and tightly wrapped them around her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia tilted her head down and kissed his deep and distinct collarbone. "Because I love you so much, you have to come back."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James grabbed her waist on both sides and suddenly flipped her over, pressing her beneath him. Countless words turned into kisses as he passionately kissed Amelia's red lips, and then kissed his way into her heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He used all his strength, fiercely wanting her. What James possessed was not just her heart, but also her body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was head over heels in love with James' tenderness, as well as his ferocity in bed. Every aspect of him occupied Amelia's heart, making her love James more and more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James desperately tried to kiss her, but he covered her eyes with his hand, not wanting her to see the look on his face. If she could see through his fingers, she would have noticed that the man who up her was already teary-eyed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they made love together, Amelia heard the man's answer in her ear. He said, "It's not just you who loves me, I love you too."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That night, neither of them slept. Amelia curled up in his arms like a child, while the man held her tightly with his strong and powerful arms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sound of rain tapping against the window could be heard outside, hitting the floor-to-ceiling windows at an angle and leaving behind traces of water. James stared at the raindrops, quietly feeling the emotions of her departure...</span></p></div>
