        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And... due to excessive bleeding during the first incision, the pregnant woman started hemorrhaging. In an effort to save the mother, the doctors ended up taking too long to deliver the baby, and by the time they took the baby out, it wasn't breathing..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With his elbows resting on his knees and his upper body slightly leaning forward, the man, James, heard the doctor's words one after another, and a sudden burst of anger flashed in his eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Almost in an instant, the man, filled with rage, stood up abruptly and approached the doctor.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He grabbed the doctor's neck and lifted him off the ground, pressing him forcefully against the door of the operating room.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What did you say?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The male doctor was frightened by James, his trembling body unable to resist. Under the overwhelming pressure, he had to overcome his fear and speak again...</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The mother had excessive bleeding that couldn't be stopped, and the baby had a weak heartbeat and no breath. It was dying... it was dying fast..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James's heart sank, as if it had suddenly plummeted to the bottom of a valley.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The silence was deafening, and he couldn't hear anything except the ringing of death in his ears...</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He felt dizzy, his vision darkened, and he felt completely out of control, as if he had fallen off a cliff, only to be pulled back up in an instant.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As James slowly regained consciousness, he resembled an enraged lion, his eyes bloodshot.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He let go of the male doctor, took a step forward, and disregarding everything, he stormed into the operating room.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inside, the doctors were still trying to save the lives of the mother and the baby. Fresh red blood flowed down the surgical table, and the strong smell of blood filled the air.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under the cold surgical lights, a pale face reflected the scene.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When James's gaze fell upon the flowing blood, his deep black pupils suddenly contracted, and the sensation in his heart changed from dull pain to... fear.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had never seen so much blood before, nor did he know that a person could bleed so much, as if they were draining all the blood from their body.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was madness, flowing out from that small body...</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fixated on the flowing blood, James took a step back.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't dare to go inside, standing at the doorway with a lonely and fearful expression, as if he had been abandoned by the world.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, he lost all his courage.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dr. Gilbert was trying to resuscitate the baby who wasn't breathing, while Dr. Tenny was desperately trying to save the mother.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia's uterus and belly were bleeding uncontrollably, no matter what they did...</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dr. Tenny, drenched in sweat, changed one hemostatic clamp after another, giving it his all.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the electrocardiogram eventually turned into a flat line. Dr. Tenny looked at the instrument and then...</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Quick! Perform CPR!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though the heart had stopped, he ordered the other doctors to continue the resuscitation efforts.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the bleeding couldn't be stopped. Even if they managed to restore the heartbeat, it would still be a certain death.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dr. Tenny had used all his skills to stop the bleeding, but it was futile. Looking at the gushing blood, Dr. Tenny knew there was no hope.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a silent pause, he stopped his actions...</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He turned around and looked towards the door, just in time to see the tall and sturdy figure of James, who was unsteady on his feet and slid down the door frame...</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it weren't for his knees supporting him, James would have fallen to the ground. The feeling of the world collapsing enveloped him, making him feel as if he were trapped in an icy cave, devoid of the strength to stand up...</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dr. Tenny walked up to him, took off his sweat-soaked mask, and said with regret, "Mr. Evans, I'm sorry... we really did our best. Please accept our condolences."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James suddenly laughed, a trembling laughter that shook his whole body. He raised his eyes, filled with a murderous gaze, and stared at Dr. Tenny.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who are you offering condolences to?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Dr. Tenny could finish his words, a strong hand grabbed his throat.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Dr. Tenny was about to be choked to death, Paul rushed over and grabbed James's arm, his veins bulging.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"James, Grandpa brought Hugh here. Amelia can be saved. Please let go of Dr. Tenny and let him assist Hugh in saving Amelia..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, James couldn't hear anything, and he couldn't even see clearly. But he heard that Amelia could be saved. Because of those words, he released Dr. Tenny...</span></p></div>
