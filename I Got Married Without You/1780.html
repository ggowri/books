        <h1>Chapter 1780 James went head-to-head with 1-2</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>1-2 was originally in the B area dealing with matters, but he received a call from Emily, which made him return to the A area ahead of schedule. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he emerged from the exclusive passage, he saw the corridor littered with black-clad individuals who had been shot. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sight of blood flowing like a river made 1-2 subconsciously furrow his brow. "Damn it!" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With his entourage, 1-2 stepped over the fallen individuals and quickly made his way to the program room. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as he pushed the door open, he saw James sitting in the middle of the sofa. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was lounging lazily, with his long legs casually crossed and his hands resting on his thighs, holding a blood-stained gun between his palms. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His head was lightly resting on the sofa, chin slightly raised, and he looked down at the incoming people with eyes devoid of fear, as if he was looking at dead men. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had bullet holes in his shoulders and legs, blood continuously flowing. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well done, you managed to make it all the way to the program room," 1-2 said upon seeing James, not blaming him but rather applauding him. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Erebus needs someone like you, with courage. I like that, but..." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>1-2's clapping hands slowly descended, and he then pulled out a gun and aimed it at James' forehead. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you're not the leader of S, maybe I would spare your life!" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before he could finish his sentence, 1-2 pulled the trigger, but unfortunately, James was quicker and had already aimed at 1-2's abdomen, hitting him accurately. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As 1-2 was hit first, his shot missed its mark. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James dodged 1-2's bullet and, despite the gunfire from the black-clad individuals behind 1-2, he swiftly rushed to 1-2. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>1-2, having been shot, was now clutching his abdomen. In a moment of distraction, his neck was restrained by a strong arm. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Overwhelmed by a sense of suffocation, 1-2 became furious and exerted all his strength to struggle with James, but he couldn't break free from his grip and was disarmed. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, James, seemingly impervious to pain, danger, or fear of death, was determined to kill 1-2. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not only did he strangle 1-2 several times, but he also used 1-2's body as a shield against the bullets. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The black-clad individuals dared not move, only watching as James, with 1-2 in tow, entered the chip room inside the program room. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the door closed, James pressed the lock button. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After seeing several locks on the door, he suddenly raised his elbow and struck 1-2's back with force. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>1-2 groaned in pain and, as he tried to get up to confront James, he was shot in the shoulder. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The piercing pain from the bullet passing through made 1-2 clutch his shoulder and collapse on the floor, in agony. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James then lifted his heavy boot and stepped on 1-2's back, rendering him immobile. He grabbed 1-2's collar and dragged the injured 1-2 towards a row of white surgical pods. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite 1-2's resistance, James forcefully pushed him into one of the pods. "You dare to perform brain surgery on me, you bastard!" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James didn't even look at him, but with all his strength, he threw the struggling 1-2 into the pod and closed the door. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He then raised his slender fingers and pressed the lock button. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The door quickly sealed shut, and without blinking, James moved to the adjacent start button. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he pressed it, the machinery inside began to operate rapidly.</span></p></div>
