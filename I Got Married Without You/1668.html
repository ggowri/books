        <h1>Chapter 1668 Ryan's surgery was successful</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva couldn't believe she was pregnant. She went to the doctor for another check-up, and the results confirmed that she was indeed pregnant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sitting on the hospital bed, Eva held the report and examined it repeatedly, slowly accepting the reality of her pregnancy...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That night, they didn't use protection. The next day, when Eva woke up, she was caught by Amelia, and then called away by Kate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She hadn't taken emergency contraception within 72 hours, so it was no surprise that she was pregnant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But this child came at the wrong time...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Eva's sad and anxious expression, Ryan furrowed his brows slightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Eva, is the child Paul's?" he asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva felt embarrassed when he figured it out, but she didn't deny it and nodded directly at Ryan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then why aren't you happy?" he asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wasn't she ready to accept Paul's proposal? Why was she still so troubled?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva raised her hand and touched her belly. She couldn't feel the rhythm of life yet, but it still weighed heavily on her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't know..." she said, tears rolling down her cheeks as she looked at Ryan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Maybe I've become more sensitive after getting pregnant."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wiped away her tears and smiled at Ryan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ryan, you go back to your place first. I'll calm down here and then come find you, okay?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ryan stared at her, unsure if it was due to pregnancy sensitivity or emotional distress.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He felt that Eva had a lot on her mind, but didn't know how to express it, so he chose to keep quiet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He took out a square handkerchief and wiped away the tears that kept falling from her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll wait for you at home, but please don't cry."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A gentle smile appeared on Ryan's warm face, like the winter sun, always able to warm people's hearts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay, I won't cry anymore."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing her obediently nod, Ryan put away the handkerchief, pushed the wheelchair, </span><span>and left the hospital room, leaving Eva alone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Watching his receding figure in the wheelchair, Eva thought about Ryan and Amelia's missed opportunity, as well as Erin and Stella's fate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wondered, did it really matter whether Paul slept with Elsie or not?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva, maybe it's better for you to be a little confused and pretend that nothing happened, as long as he is willing to change for you in the future.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Startled by her own thoughts, Eva was suddenly shocked. Did she like Paul that much?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Was she really considering being with him in this confused manner?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But wasn&rsquo;t this the root of all her problems?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Whether Elsie's words were true or false, she didn't care at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The only thing she cared about was whether or not to let go of everything and unconditionally trust that Paul would never do such a thing again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just like his promise during the proposal, from now on, no more drinking, and no more contact with any other women.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As long as he could do these two things, whether Paul had a relationship with Elsie or not, she was willing to forget about that night.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just... consider it as him being drunk and unconsciously making a mistake.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After figuring out what mattered most to her, Eva lifted the covers, got out of bed, and stood up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Ryan said, if she failed, she could start over. What was there to be afraid of?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, she was already pregnant with his baby, the arrival of a new life, and the arrival of the family she longed for.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Filled with hope, Eva returned to her place, helped Zoey pack up, and then accompanied Ryan on the flight back to Arcadia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After the plane landed in Imperial Capital and Ryan was settled, Eva expressed her desire to return to Arcadia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ryan suggested that she rest for a few days before leaving, but Eva refused, saying, "I need to go back and take care of some things."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was in a hurry to see Paul, which made Ryan smile knowingly. "What about your pregnancy..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva pulled the handle of her suitcase, revealing a determined smile, and smiled at Ryan. "I'll tell him myself."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ryan nodded and waved goodbye to her. After they bid farewell, Eva hurriedly returned to Arcadia, while Ryan took out Edith's business card.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stared at the name on it, hesitated for a few seconds, then asked Zoey to bring him his phone and saved the number from the card, then sent a text message.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[Miss Evans, I have completed the surgery and need rehabilitation treatment. When are you available?]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Edith, who was conducting a meeting in Imperial Capital, saw the message and slowly curved her lips, then lowered her head to type.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[Pay the treatment fee of $500,000 in advance.]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Ryan saw the bank account numbers in the message, he didn't think too much and directly gave them to Zoey to make the payment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon receiving the bank account notification, Edith thought Ryan was quite good, obediently doing what she asked, like a well-behaved child.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[Tomorrow, I'll visit your clinic for treatment.]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After sending the message, Edith added another condition.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[You'll cover all meals except breakfast.]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ryan read it and simply replied 'okay', then threw his phone aside and took out the book, continuing to stare at the words on the page, lost in thought.</span></p></div>
