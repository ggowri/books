        <h1>Chapter 1638 Do you think you deserve him?</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kate's words were like a sharp stab, piercing deep into Eva's heart. The rosy color on her face instantly faded, leaving only a pale complexion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, Eva could feel Anthony's pain from years ago. His gentle and noble face, which seemed kind-hearted, why did he say something so hard to accept?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't have parents, so how could Kate not know when she had looked into her background?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kate was clearly intentionally hitting her sore spot...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva, who had originally intended to marry Paul, suddenly had a change of heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marriage was not just between two individuals, but also between two families.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Having grown up without a family, she naturally longed for a warm and loving family on the male side. But the woman in front of her...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva clenched her hand and dug her nails into her flesh, stabilizing her emotions. "Mrs. Evans, I don't have parents..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kate didn't even pretend to look surprised and said directly, "I know, that's why I think you and Paul aren't very suitable..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The implication was that a child raised without parents couldn't match her son.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it were someone else's parents sitting across from her, Eva would have left a long time ago. But facing Paul's mother, she didn't do that, even though she was hurting inside. She bit her lip and endured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She would do this solely because of Paul. It couldn't be denied that she liked Paul and couldn't let him go. So, for him, she should try to fight for it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking this, Eva loosened her tightly clenched fist and calmly looked at Kate. "Mrs. Evans, not having parents is not my fault. You can't think that just because of this, Paul and I aren't suitable."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva didn't directly address the hidden meaning behind Kate's words, she simply continued along with her words. But to Kate, it seemed like Eva didn't understand when to give up. "Ms. Miller, I didn't want to be too harsh with my words, but since you don't understand, let me make it clear."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed like Eva could guess what Kate was going to say next. Her face grew even paler, but Kate ignored her emotions and continued to embarrass her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let me put it like this, my son comes from an influential family, he graduated from an Ivy League university and is a computer genius. You only graduated high school </span><span>and have no special skills. He's never been married, but you've been divorced. He's currently the CEO of the Asia-Pacific region, while you run an entertainment venue. There's a big gap between you in terms of birth, education background, marital status, and social status. Do you think you deserve him? "</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After such a comparison, Eva truly couldn't match up to Paul. It was only natural that his mother didn't agree.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva thought about this and felt even more that she wasn't good enough for Paul. But Paul said he loved her and wanted to marry her. Could she disappoint him?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva lowered her gaze and hesitated for a long time. Then she slowly raised her pale face and stared at Kate, who had never experienced hardships due to her high-born and sheltered life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I couldn't choose my background, and as for my education... Mrs. Evans, do you know that when you don't have money to eat, how can you focus on your studies? At that time, I just wanted to fill my stomach. After all, who can endure not eating or drinking for five days and nights..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she said this, tears suddenly filled Eva's eyes. She herself couldn't go without eating or drinking, nor could she stop Amelia's medication or deny Ryan's education. Being the older one, she had to set an example and take care of them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing the words "not eating or drinking for five days and nights," Kate was somewhat shocked. It seemed like she could understand how difficult it was for orphans to survive in society. But because the orphan in front of her was going to marry her son, she chose to turn a blind eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Miller, I sympathize with the hardships you faced as a child, but I didn't cause them."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Indeed, it wasn't Kate's fault, but those words still hurt Eva. However, she was foolish to say these things to Kate. What was the point? People born into wealthy families, how could they understand the hardships of the common folk?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When she was studying, she only focused on finding part-time jobs, thinking that if she started working early, she could earn more money and help Ryan and Amelia, who had better academic performance. She thought that if they succeeded, it would be equivalent to her own success.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Later on, it turned out to be true. Ryan and Amelia were both outstanding. She felt that this was enough, but she didn't expect that both Jayden's mother and Paul's mother would still care about these things.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She couldn't decide her background, and she wasn't academically outstanding. She felt that she was just an ordinary person, so she married an ordinary person, hoping to live a peaceful life. But things didn't go as planned, and a bunch of troubles forced her to climb up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But what kind of position could a person like her reach?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't have a good family, no one to help, and no connections. All she had was the inheritance left by Ryan. If it weren't for this inheritance, she wouldn't even be able to become the manager of a night venue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For ordinary people, it's really difficult to achieve great success. So, how could she not hope for a good family background, being nurtured and educated from birth to </span><span>adulthood, having experienced the wider world at a young age, and having better genes like Paul...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she didn't have that background or those parents. She could only rely on herself to struggle and climb up.</span></p></div>
