        <h1>Chapter 1782 James controlled 1-2</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You can't control me!" Nick would never allow James to manipulate him, even if he was in excruciating pain, he refused to submit. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James didn't force Nick, he simply picked up the controller and gently pressed the </span><span>button to activate the pain control system. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nick instantly screamed in agony, the heart-wrenching sound echoing through the chip room, sending shivers down the spine. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was drenched in cold sweat, his face deathly pale, but he still lifted his head to look at the tall, imposing man in front of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've informed 1-1, he will be here soon, and when he arrives, you will have nowhere to hide!" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James, with an expressionless face, walked up to Nick, staring at the aged face, and spoke in a cold voice. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Follow my orders, or I will make sure you have nowhere to hide right now." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nick, who was on the verge of passing out from the pain, glanced at the controller in James' hand and then at the console. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The screen showed that his chip at the back of his head was already linked to James' chip. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Nick wanted to survive, he had to listen to James. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he didn't, James' controller could make him suffer to the point of death. Unless 1-1 arrived and rewrote James' chip program to regain control. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the key issue was that it would take a long time for 1-1 to arrive. During this time, Nick would undoubtedly be under James' control, or he would be tortured to death. Thinking of this, Nick reluctantly lowered his head and said, "Activate the full area control key. I'll instruct Venom to track down the Moore father and daughter."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James turned to the console, took out the full area control key, and pressed the start button. "Go on." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nick, enduring the pain, gritted his teeth and said, "Venom, take your men and find the Moore father and daughter. Bring them back within a day." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Venom, sitting in the program room, heard the broadcast and froze, his eyes filled with disbelief. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought James was already dead in the upper area, and he was waiting for 1-2 to come and punish him. He never expected to receive such news. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Did James negotiate with 1-2, or did he directly force 1-2 to submit? </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Venom was not sure, but he knew that his understanding of James had reached a new level. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After snapping out of his daze, he extinguished his cigarette and replied, "Okay, I'll go find them right away." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Venom quickly got up, took his men, and swiftly left Erebus to search for the Moore father and daughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After giving the order, Nick, still enduring the pain, turned to James and said, "Once 1-1 arrives, you are as good as dead." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James, emotionless, sat down on the sofa, looking extremely lazy and exhausted. He was indeed very tired, with wounds on his body still bleeding, and wounds in his heart also bleeding. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was no place on him that didn't hurt. But he endured it, like a fearless warrior, unabashedly leaning back on the sofa, staring coldly at Nick. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I just told you, if I die, you will die too." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nick's face was extremely ugly. He was always the one controlling others, and now he was being controlled in turn. How could he not be angry? </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But in the current situation, even if 1-1 rewrote the program, they couldn't kill James. Their chips were bound together, so if James died, he would die too. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James wanted to use 1-2 to restrain 1-1, so even if 1-1 came, they couldn't do anything to James. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In this regard, they were very passive. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking of this, Nick clenched his fists in resentment. "Let me out, I need medical treatment." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he died, James would have nothing to restrain 1-1. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James stared at him for a while, then got up and opened the surgical pod. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nick came out of the pod, holding the back of his head, and quickly left the chip room. The black-clad men waiting outside all raised their guns and aimed at James. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No one is allowed to touch him!" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The black-clad men froze in place at 1-2's command. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nick didn't explain, he just forced himself to go to the medical room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James sat back on the sofa, gazing at the lights embedded in the ceiling. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The bright light shone into his crimson eyes, not causing any discomfort, only a sense of despair. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He longed to see Amelia, to hold her, to kiss her, but she was gone. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James closed his eyes in pain, his mind filled with every smile and frown of Amelia's, and the disappointment when she left. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She left this world twice, disappointed in him, and he didn't deserve her love. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James raised his blood-soaked hand and covered his eyes. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, when he resolved everything, he could go find her. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James waited for a long time, but Emily didn't come. Instead, 1-1 and 1-3 arrived.</span></p></div>
