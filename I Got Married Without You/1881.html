        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Paul arrived, the surgery had already begun, and Andrew and Peter stood straight outside the operating room, waiting. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia sat on a chair outside, her fair fingers caressing her abdomen, one hand on her belly and the other gripping the armrest. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The back of her hand gripping the armrest was a bit forceful, and upon closer inspection, one could see protruding bones. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her complexion wasn't very good either, having not eaten or slept well during the days she was confined. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On top of that, she finally got to see James, only for him to get injured, so naturally her emotions were tense. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fortunately, the doctor said that the bullet had hit James in the shoulder and hadn't caused any vital damage, otherwise she wouldn't have been able to hold on. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As pregnant women, Eva had gained several pounds while Amelia had become particularly thin, clearly having endured a lot during her pregnancy. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul wasn't very sympathetic towards other women, but seeing Amelia looking so </span><span>exhausted, he couldn't help but furrow his brow. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Amelia." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul walked up to Amelia and advised her to go back to the hotel to rest. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You look exhausted, go back and rest." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia shifted her gaze away from the operating room and looked up at Paul standing in front of her. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry, I'm fine." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if she was exhausted, she had to wait until James' surgery was over and he was safe before she could relax. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She became stubborn, just like James. Paul tried to persuade her for a few moments, but seeing that he couldn't change her mind, he stopped trying. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then I'll have someone arrange a rest area for you." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying that, he didn't care whether Amelia agreed or not, he simply waved his hand and had someone take care of it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Paul was persuading Amelia to go to the rest area, the door to the operating room opened and the doctor walked out. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How is it?" Paul immediately approached and asked. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia also hurriedly leaned on the armrest and walked over, anxiously looking at the doctor. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Was the surgery successful?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The doctor took off his mask, revealing a confident smile. "The surgery was very successful, he has been transferred to the ward, you can go see him now." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The four people outside the operating room finally breathed a sigh of relief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Amelia wanted to go to the ward with them, she suddenly felt the baby move. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia, who was feeling some pain in her stomach, could only lean against the wall for support and rest. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The men didn't notice and rushed straight to the ward. James, lying on the hospital bed, opened his eyes and didn't see Amelia. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His face was even paler than when he had the surgery. He thought something had happened to Amelia and completely disregarded the injury on his shoulder. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He tried to sit up, scaring Andrew, Peter, and Paul, who quickly held him down. "James, you just had surgery, don't move around." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because he exerted force, James' shoulder started bleeding again, quickly staining the white gauze red, but he didn't notice. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Where's Amelia?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, he was still weak from the anesthesia and couldn't push away the hands of the others, so he could only grab Paul's arm from behind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Did Matty take her away again?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul thought he was going to the bathroom, but who knew he was in such a hurry because he didn't see his wife at first glance. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"James..." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul didn't have a chance to speak yet when Amelia, who had already entered the room, supported herself against the wall and slowly walked to the door. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing that frail figure, James' worried heart suddenly relaxed. "Are you feeling </span><span>unwell?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No." Amelia shook her head and pointed to her own belly. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The baby heard that your surgery was successful and is dancing inside me." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing that it was discomfort caused by the baby's movements, James' cold gaze swept over Amelia's belly. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"After he's born, I'll teach him a lesson." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia, who had already entered the room, heard this and glanced at him coldly. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The baby hasn't even been born yet, and you're already thinking about teaching him a lesson. You're really something." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After murmuring these words, Amelia shifted her gaze back to his shoulder. "Why is it bleeding again?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She furrowed her brow, bent down, and touched the bloodstains on the gauze. "I'll go call the doctor." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James grabbed Amelia's hand and held it in his own palm. "It's nothing, you don't need to do it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing this, Andrew and Peter instantly understood and exchanged glances. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll go call the doctor." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then I'll go buy some food and drinks." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Andrew and Peter walked away, leaving Paul alone. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Paul." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul thought James was going to say something special to him, so he leaned over, sat next to the hospital bed, and looked at him expectantly. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"James, go back and take care of Eva."</span></p></div>
