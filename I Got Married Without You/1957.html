        <h1>Chapter 1957 Gouge out Your Eyes</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon sitting down, Beth was greeted with enthusiasm by Grace, who brought over some desserts and offered them to her. "Beth, you must be famished after being on stage for so long. Have some desserts to satisfy your hunger."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beth was a mixed-race girl with blonde hair, smooth skin, and a high nose bridge. Her eyes were as blue as a lake, stunning and starry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To Grace, Beth was like a doll. Grace loved her very much and wanted to be as slim and pretty as her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, under the attentive care of Amelia and James, she thrived and continued to grow plumper. At twelve years old, she had yet to experience a growth spurt, leaving her to wonder if she would remain a little chubby girl as she got older.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking of this, Grace found the desserts in her hands unappetizing and promptly gave them all to Beth. "I've decided to start losing weight. Help me finish these."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beth smiled. Despite her reluctance to indulge, she graciously accepted. "Ms. Grace Skender Johnson, you are not overweight but very cute."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grace grinned. "Beth, cute is a word for fat people."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beth's smile froze for a moment. Then, she made an excuse. "Sorry, I'm not very good at expressing myself."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In contrast to Grace's innocence, Beth, four years her junior, appeared noticeably more cautious and even somewhat inferior. This made her adept at using words to ingratiate herself with others at a young age, and any failure to do so would instantly evoke feelings of fear and guilt within her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was tied to her history of childhood abuse. Grace, aware of Beth's past, gazed at her with eyes brimming with remorse and gently patted her shoulder. "I was only teasing you. It's okay if you call me a little chubby. I won't mind."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beth was still very sorry and kept apologizing. Grace had no choice but to fetch a sparkler to cheer her up. Before getting up, she said, "James, I'll go grab a sparkler from over there and be right back."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Observing James' nod, Alexander attempted to excuse himself, but James' large hand pressed firmly against his chest once more. "Grace won't wander around, but you will, so just stay put."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was angry. He turned his head and accidentally met Beth's eyes. Always eager to please others, she immediately beamed gently at him. "Hello..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He cast a disdainful glimpse of her as though she were a fool before redirecting his attention to the stage. Beth, seated beside him with an empty chair between them, was instantaneously embarrassed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't know what she had done wrong or why Alexander disliked her. She was obviously being very courteous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beth rolled up her dress sleeves nervously while secretly sizing Alexander up. Upon their first encounter, she perceived him to be as cold as an ice sculpture.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite being three years younger than her, Alexander possessed a formidable presence that surpassed Beth's. Merely sitting there, he emitted an intimidating aura.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His silence, moreover, heightened the indifference, which was a striking feature of him at such an early age. She pondered what he would be like as an adult.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's overly chilly attitude aroused Beth's curiosity. She kept stealing glances at him out of the corner of her eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps sensing her burning stare, he turned his head slightly and shot an icy glare at her. "If you gaze at me again, I'll gouge out your eyes."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beth's heart skipped a beat with fear. She hastily looked away, not daring to survey him again. Noticing her pallid complexion and her obvious terror, Alexander sneered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Grace retrieved the sparkler, the wedding was over. Dylan took Michelle's hand. Together, they descended from the wedding stage and boarded a luxurious carriage, departing from the castle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beth was taken home by the Lawrence family. Before leaving, she didn't even dare to take another peek at Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grace rushed forward and gave her the sparkler, as well as a warm hug.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Beth, the past is the past. You will be happy. Come on!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beth felt Grace's encouragement. Snuggled in her arms, Beth nodded and plucked up the courage to reciprocate the embrace.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From the moment they met as youngsters, there was an instant connection and mutual admiration between them. As they matured, their friendship only deepened, making it a beautiful experience.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Grace, let's go home."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing James' cold voice, Grace reluctantly let go of Beth. "Dylan has my phone number. Remember to contact me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Grace pivoted around and ran toward James, who was already holding Alexander with one hand and Amelia with the other. "James, wait for me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beth couldn't help but chuckle while watching Grace approaching them in her full figure. She squeezed Alexander away and grabbed James' hand. Her hand, however, was shaken from him and seized by Amelia instead.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps one day, Beth, like Grace, would frolic with Dylan, who wasn't her biological father but held a paternal role in her life. Even if Michelle were to have more children down the road, Dylan would continue to care for her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Beth dreamed of a brighter future, Alexander's straight back in the little suit flashed across her mind. She had no other expectations but one wish that Michelle's future children would never be as indifferent as Alexander.</span></p></div>
