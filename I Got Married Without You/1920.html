        <h1>Chapter 1920 Amelia fell into a deep coma</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hugh agreed and stood by, ready to follow the old doctor's orders.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It didn't take long for various complications to arise, just as the old doctor had anticipated.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After handing the scalpel to Hugh, the old doctor instructed Dr. Gilbert and Dr. Tenny to handle other complications while he focused on resolving the heart failure issue.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Throughout his career, the old doctor had saved many lives, but this patient proved to be quite challenging.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even he felt powerless in the face of so many complications. He continued the life-saving surgery while instructing a nurse to inform the family of the critical condition.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In this situation, with all the complications erupting, he couldn't guarantee that he could save Amelia's life once again.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Outside the operating room, James, filled with despair once again, saw the death notification letter handed to him by the doctor.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stood there like a soulless corpse, in a pitiful state, frozen in place.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Evans, please sign here."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Signing this letter meant that Amelia's condition had deteriorated to the point where even the old doctor couldn't save her.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James didn't have the courage to sign that letter. His eyes were bloodshot, filled with a feeling worse than death.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Doctor, no matter what, you can't give up. You must find a way to save her again!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing the plea from outside, the old doctor furrowed his brows tightly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With so many complications, how could he save her? Even if he had ten more of himself, it would be difficult to save her...</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inside the operating room, the baby in the incubator, perhaps sensing that its mother was dying, cried incessantly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The cries were so desperate that they brought tears to the eyes of Dr. Gilbert and the other doctors and nurses.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Doctor, although my medical skills are not as good as yours, please try your best to save Mrs. Evans!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The old doctor glanced at Dr. Gilbert, then at Dr. Tenny, and the other doctors in the operating room who were trying to save their patients.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't know if he had been infected by their youthful energy, but in that moment of giving up, hope rekindled within him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Everyone, continue saving the patient!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Friends and family of the Evans family were scattered across the country, but they all rushed to the hospital as quickly as possible.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dylan, with a gunshot wound, arrived with his two brothers from the neighboring country.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When the younger generation arrived at the hospital, the surgery had already been going on for twelve hours.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The old doctor was exhausted, and his fingers holding the scalpel trembled.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't have the strength to continue, so he directed Dr. Gilbert and Dr. Tenny to take over and continue the surgery.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fortunately, the two doctors were exceptionally talented, and wherever the old doctor pointed, they could accurately follow.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he guided them, the old doctor couldn't help but marvel at the luck of this patient, encountering four medical prodigies.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Dr. Gilbert and Dr. Tenny were slightly inferior to Hugh, they were no less capable in handling complications.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After the efforts of all the doctors, the patient slowly regained normal vital signs. Blood pressure dropped, acute organ failure ceased, and the brain hemorrhage was controlled.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The other complications also dissipated. However, the patient who had gone through all these hardships fell into a deep coma...</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The old doctor knew that this was the limit. The patient's body was no longer suitable for further resuscitation.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the disappointed gaze of the doctors, he struggled to stand up from his chair...</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James, who had received countless death notifications, suppressed his trembling fingers and looked at the solemn old doctor.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He pushed aside the doctors at the door and stepped out...</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't want to hear that news!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His voice, hoarse and desperate, echoed through the corridor, evoking sympathy from the Evans family, the Lawrence family, and the Clark family.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Moore, is there really no hope?" Matty stepped forward, unable to accept it, and asked the old doctor, Moore.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The patient is in a deep coma, which is as good as having no hope."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing the old doctor's words, hope faded from James's eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He grabbed the old doctor's arm and lowered his pale face, saying excitedly:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She's just in a coma, which means there's still hope. Please save her quickly. If you can save her, I'm willing to give you all my wealth!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at the frantic James, the old doctor, after a few seconds of silence, gave a hopeless answer:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Evans, your wife is in a deep coma, which is as good as having no hope. Unless a miracle happens, but the chances of that are almost zero."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man, doused with cold water, lost all hope in his eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He released his grip on the old doctor's arm, and like a soulless puppet, he moved his numb body into the operating room, under the gaze of the doctors and nurses.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When James saw Amelia, with tubes inserted all over her body, the tears that had been suppressed in his eyes uncontrollably rolled down his cheeks.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The once strong man, faced with his wife's impending death, became as weak as if his marrow had been sucked out, and he knelt in front of the operating table.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia, you finally came back, but now you're trapped again. Did the fog on your way home make it hard for you to see the road? I'll come to pick you up, okay?</span></p></div>
