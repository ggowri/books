        <h1>Chapter 1716 The final goodbye</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James came down the escalator and saw Amelia standing in the restaurant, lost in thought. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He quickly walked over and took the dish from her hand. "Honey, let the servants handle this kind of thing in the future. Don't carry it yourself, you might burn your hand."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The tenderness and indulgence in his tone hit Amelia's heart, stirring up a sense of reluctance. However, she forced herself to respond obediently, "Okay..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James set down the pot and glanced at the Davies siblings who had just walked in. He grabbed Amelia's hand and placed it in his palm. "Amelia, I have to leave. Take care of yourself while I'm gone."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia felt like she was ready, but when she heard the words 'I'm leaving', her eyes still turned red.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't want him to see, so she quickly raised her hand and pointed to the dishes on the table, shifting her gaze. "Honey, that's the lunch I made for you. Can you please finish it before you leave?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Holden stood at the doorway and heard the words. He raised his wrist and checked his watch. "Mr. Evans, we only have half an hour left before the ship departs. We're running out of time."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James ignored Holden and went straight to Amelia, pulling out a chair and sitting down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Holden glanced at Emelyn before shifting his gaze to Amelia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia wanted to be a little rebellious and have James eat her last homemade lunch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, she also had to force herself to grow into a resilient tree.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After staring at James for a moment, she slowly spoke, "Honey, don't keep people waiting for too long."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James's hand holding the spoon froze for a moment, then he scooped up a spoonful of soup and brought it to Amelia's lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't say anything, just gestured with his eyes for Amelia to finish her drink. But Amelia just smiled and shook her head, "Let's go."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James tightened his grip on the spoon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stared at Amelia, silent for a long time before putting down his spoon and letting go of her, getting up and leaving.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He walked away decisively, without even glancing back at Amelia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Amelia watched the figure quickly walking towards the door, tears streamed down her face uncontrollably...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought they were parting ways, but the car that drove out suddenly stopped, and then a tall and straight figure quickly returned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia was caught off guard as James pulled her into his embrace. Before she knew it, her chin was lifted and he kissed her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Endless and lingering kisses, pouring out all of James' reluctance, as if he couldn't bear to stop and wanted to kiss her until the end of time. But he was painfully aware that this was impossible...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James, who was slowly losing his composure, gently bit her lip and slowly released </span><span>her...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wait for me to come back."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This promise, however, couldn't ease the unease and reluctance in Amelia's heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was afraid that he wouldn't come back, but she pretended that he would, with a gentle smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James gently touched her face and ran his fingers through her hair before pulling back and turning away, leaving her behind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, Amelia sat in her spot and waited for a long time, but James never came back. She knew he had really left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the car, Holden glanced at James and saw that he was constantly staring at the rearview mirror. He quickly took out his phone and sent a message to Zack...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thirty minutes later, James and Holden got out of the car. Emelyn, who was sitting in the back, lowered the window and looked at their usually calm eyes, now filled with worry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Shawn, please protect my brother."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When convincing James to go to Erebus, Holden had promised to go with him and fight by his side until the end, no matter the outcome. Holden always keeps his promises, so he will definitely go.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emelyn couldn't persuade him, so she could only hope for James. After all, he was the only one who had ever come out alive from that place...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James tilted his head slightly and glanced at her, but said nothing. He then continued walking towards the pier.</span></p></div>
