        <h1>Chapter 1845: Why Do You Deserve James's Love?</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shocked by the news, Simon momentarily lost himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite facing partial paralysis, he was willing to step aside if Emily preferred his brother. It was his way of letting go.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knowingly took the pills Emily had tampered with, almost daring her to stop him. But she didn't. His seizure, foam at his mouth, left Emily shaken. She had killed a man who loved her, casting a dark shadow over her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emily didn't confess to murder, only to tampering with Simon's medication.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Facing Amelia's piercing gaze, she remained unremorseful, a cold smirk on her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sure, I swapped his pills. But he could've chosen not to take them. He chose to make my job easier."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia, who'd already pieced together the puzzle, looked at the unrepentant Emily, finding her both despicable and pitiful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You could've had the most sincere, precious love. But you destroyed it and killed James's brother. And that's probably why James can never love you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emily's heart clenched as if stabbed, anger making her leap to her feet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And what about you? I knew James before you. I've done more for him than you ever did. How could you take him away from me?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at Emily, who tried to attack but was held back by chains, Amelia's expression turned frigid.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then what gives you the right? To seduce Simon just to get close to James? Or to kill Simon in hopes that he'd fall for you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia stared at the face that bore a resemblance to hers, growing increasingly agitated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Love doesn't care about who came first. Plus, I knew nothing about you two until we split. How can you blame me for him not loving you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who else should I blame if not you?!" Emily, her hands chained, pointed at Amelia and yelled hysterically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You sold yourself! If it wasn't for your pity act, James wouldn't have bought you. It was you who first seduced him, made him let you into his life!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Facing the furious Emily, Amelia calmly told her the truth. "James didn't buy me out of pity. He knew me long </span><span>before,</span><span> he said it was love at first sight..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No way!" Emily refused to believe. "He's never been interested in women. How could he fall for you at first sight?" After yelling, she looked at Amelia's face. "It must be because you look like me, that's why he noticed you, right?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If anyone's a copy, it's you copying me," Amelia retorted, touching her cheek.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Why's</span><span> that?" Emily scoffed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Because your mom's meddling, your dad's cheating."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emily was stunned, but before she could respond, Amelia stood, walking towards her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Emily, you've lived a life of luxury since birth, groomed into a rich beauty by Brandon. How did that happen?" Amelia grabbed Emily's face, forcing her to meet her hateful gaze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You enjoyed a lavish lifestyle thanks to my mom, </span><span>Sumasa's</span><span>, fortune. The </span><span>Moores</span><span> became an Arcadia powerhouse because of her. Without her, your family would be bankrupt, a bunch of hated debtors. But your mom, for her illegitimate child and herself, persuaded Brandon to betray </span><span>Sumasa</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If not for God's mercy, allowing us to survive, you'd have lived off someone else's hard work." Amelia caressed Emily's perfect skin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Maybe it's karma. The happiness you gained through deceit is now being repaid. James, who you always wanted, loves me. To avenge me, he bought the Moore Group. Now you and Brandon have lost everything, back to square one."</span></p></div>
