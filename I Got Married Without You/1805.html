        <h1>Chapter 1805 Gigi attached Amelia</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia looked at Eva and noticed the same expression in her eyes. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She slowly lowered her gaze and said, "Let's talk about it when he comes back." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul caught on to the implied meaning and quickly smiled, "Amelia, you're so kind. Let me get you some more soup." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul served the soup and placed it in front of Amelia. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before she could take a sip, Johnny walked in. "I ran into the Lawrence family's three </span><span>brothers</span><span> downstairs. Are they here to deliver the DNA test results?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia confirmed, and Johnny wondered how the elder Mr. Lawrence knew that she resembled his first love. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia explained that Mr. Lawrence had seen her when she was substituting for her sister on a project, and he had remarked on her resemblance to his first love. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She then handed the test report to Eva and added more details for Johnny. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Johnny was still puzzled, as Dylan's explanation seemed flawless and he couldn't find any discrepancies. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He asked Amelia, "Have you decided to return to the Lawrence family?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Amelia was about to answer, Gigi burst into the room. "Amelia!" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're awake?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Gigi, Johnny instinctively furrowed his brow. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hadn't informed her, but she had come to the hospital on her own. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>During this time, Gigi had also lost weight and looked even paler. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had wanted to rest at home, but she couldn't stop worrying about Zack's life or death, so she had come to check if Amelia had woken up. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She's awake. Why didn't anyone tell me?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She looked around at the people sitting in the chairs, feeling abandoned. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I didn't inform you because I saw you weren't feeling well," Johnny explained, and without saying more, he tried to lead her away. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gigi, however, shook off his hand and walked up to Amelia, her eyes red and filled with tears. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Gigi in this state, Amelia thought of the image of Zack being swallowed by a snake, feeling both scared and heartbroken.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gigi had already sensed something from Amelia's expression, but she still asked hopefully, "Amelia, tell me, is Zack alive like James?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia didn't know how to say it, and her eyes, filled with bloodshot veins, couldn't even look at Gigi. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing that Amelia was hesitant to speak, Gigi quickly raised her pale hand and placed it on Amelia's shoulder. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't be afraid. Just tell me what you know. I won't be angry, and I won't blame you." Gigi had a faint smile on her face, appearing very stable emotionally. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Amelia was about to speak, Johnny stepped forward and once again grabbed Gigi's arm. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Her answer is the same as mine. Don't pressure her. Let me take you back to rest." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It's</span><span> unclear which words upset Gigi, but she angrily shook off Johnny's hand. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I just came to ask her. Why are you pressuring her?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I know you didn't pressure her. I'm worried about your health. I..." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Johnny could finish his sentence, Gigi, who had suddenly erupted with emotion, angrily shouted at Amelia. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm asking you a question. Why aren't you saying anything?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia had known before leaving that Gigi was emotionally unstable and had a nervous disorder, but she was still worried that Gigi wouldn't be able to handle it. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, if she didn't provide a clear answer, Gigi's heart would never be at peace. So... it's better to get it over with. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia clenched her fists and, with a pained expression, looked at Gigi. "Zack is dead." Upon hearing this answer, Gigi calmed down and didn't look as hostile as before. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a while, she suddenly let out a bitter laugh. "James is still alive, but he's dead. Is James' life more valuable than Zack's?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These words pierced Amelia's heart, causing her discomfort. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, Zack had died trying to save James. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm sorry," Amelia said, not knowing what else to say. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's the use of an apology?" Gigi, standing by the bedside, gradually lost her clear expression and became clouded with resentment. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Zack died because of your husband!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was stating a fact, and Amelia couldn't argue with her. She thought that Gigi would calm down after a few accusations. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, as Amelia lowered her gaze, the scalding hot soup suddenly splashed onto her face. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It hurt so much... </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia couldn't even speak. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As her vision blurred from the splattered soup, she saw Gigi pick up the porridge from the table and pour it over her.</span></p></div>
