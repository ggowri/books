        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva approached the answer with determination, turning around and walking to the desk. She opened the drawer and took out her ID, handing it to Paul.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm giving you one more chance. If the final result disappoints me, I will follow the agreement we signed and leave directly."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul lowered his gaze, looking at the ID and then at Eva, who had a determined look on her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't say anything, just took the ID, held her hand, and went straight to the office of the city clerk.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When they arrived at the entrance, Paul didn't unlock the car. Instead, he sat inside, looking ahead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's wrong? Do you regret it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva thought he was acting impulsively and now regretted it. She immediately felt that she had trusted him wrongly again. But then he suddenly turned his head, looking at her with intense seriousness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In the future, I will make you trust me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was because he didn't keep his distance from women that she misunderstood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he could be like James and deal with scheming women decisively, Eva wouldn't feel so insecure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He used to be carefree and didn't pay much attention to these things, but from today </span><span>onwards, he would give Eva complete security.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he provided her with a sense of security, Eva would develop trust in him. He believed he could do it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was the most reassuring promise Paul had made to Eva, and even her anxious heart finally relaxed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul held onto Eva and they went to the office of the city clerk. The process went quickly, filling out forms, medical examinations, and getting the marriage certificate... It didn't take long.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Paul received the marriage certificate, his eyes started to turn red.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No matter how difficult the process was, he finally married the woman he wanted to marry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at Paul, who was holding the certificate and lost in thought, Eva also lowered her eyelashes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After five years of twists and turns, she thought she could stay clear-headed, but in the end, she married him without much thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just moments </span><span>ago</span><span> they were arguing, and now they were getting married. It would be absurd to say it wasn't ridiculous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought that perhaps living in a daze would make life better. After all, life is rarely clear-cut...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul held the marriage certificate in one hand and held Eva's hand in the other, walking confidently out of the office of the city clerk.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After they got into the car, Paul handed one of the marriage certificates to Eva.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What kind of wedding do you want?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva took the marriage certificate and briefly looked at it. It stated that she and Paul were married, which meant they were now husband and wife.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's talk about it in a year."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What she meant was that she was giving him a one-year trial period. If within a year he didn't change his ways, she would leave, so there was no need to go through the trouble of planning a wedding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Paul held onto the marriage certificate, he felt uncomfortable and also a bit regretful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've been married before. If we have a wedding, everyone will know, and they will make fun of you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who dares to make fun of me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a cold laugh, he started the car and drove towards his own home.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Halfway there, Eva noticed that they were going the wrong way and spoke up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Where are you taking me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Home."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This isn't the way to my house."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul slowed down the car and pulled over to the side.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Eva, take a look at what you're holding."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Following his gaze, Eva looked at the marriage certificate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Since we have the marriage certificate, of course, you're coming home with me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meaning, from now on, she would live with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva raised her eyes and looked at Paul, who was being serious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I didn't bring any clothes to change into..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You don't have to worry about those things."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul picked up his phone and made a call. Soon, someone arrived at the door and moved all of Eva's things to Paul's villa.</span></p></div>
