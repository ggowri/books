        <h1>Chapter 1789 Do you want a hug?</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the murky haze of her thoughts, Amelia saw James push her away and embrace Emily. She hesitated for a moment, then rushed over, but James, with a frown, glared at her. "We are already divorced. Why do you keep haunting me?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia, somewhat incredulous, gazed up at James, who was much taller than her. "Are we divorced?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James did not respond, only holding Emily close, showing affection. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After standing motionless for a long time, Amelia took a step forward. She wanted to separate them, but she saw the man suddenly lower his head and kiss Emily. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that moment of their lips touching, Amelia's world shattered. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After enduring the heart-wrenching pain, she slowly opened her eyes. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing the white ceiling, Amelia realized she had just had a nightmare, and she was lying in a hospital room. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She struggled to move her eyes and suddenly a handsome face, like a dream, appeared before her. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you awake?" The person's eyes lit up when they saw her awake, shining like stars. Amelia looked at him, feeling dazed for a moment, then reached out and touched the face. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a real touch. He hadn't died. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A thin layer of mist gradually formed in Amelia's clear eyes. "Johnny, you're still alive. That's great..." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Johnny, also wearing a hospital gown, slightly curled his lips and looked at her, smiling freely. "Do you want a hug?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at Johnny in front of her, it felt as if she had returned to the </span><span>day</span><span> he took a bullet for her. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His selflessness and the blood all around him had brought her not only heavy guilt but also a sense of gratitude. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She stared at him, dazed for a moment, then opened her arms. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't need words; her actions conveyed everything. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The smile at the corner of Johnny's lips deepened. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He propped himself up on the armrest of the wheelchair, rose from it, and then leaned forward to scoop Amelia into his arms. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia thought it would be a brief hug, but Johnny held her tightly, not letting go, resting his chin on her shoulder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"When my father brought you back, I thought you were dead..." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was carried off the ambulance, and many people pushed her into the emergency room, doctors and nurses in a frenzy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that time, he had been shot and couldn't help at all, just sitting in a wheelchair, watching the emergency room. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had never felt anxious, nervous, or scared before, but that day's rescue had frightened him. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feeling the man holding her was afraid of something, Amelia couldn't help but raise her hand and gently pat his back. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"When you were shot that day, I thought you were dead too. Now we're both alive. Don't be afraid."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia's voice seemed to have a magical power, slowly soothing Johnny's restless emotions. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was reluctant to let go, but continuing to embrace her would be crossing a line, an irreversible abyss. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Johnny suppressed all irrational thoughts, released Amelia, and then casually sat back in the wheelchair. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is there anything uncomfortable? Tell me, I'll have the doctor check you again." Amelia shook her head and quietly placed her hand on her abdomen. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Was</span><span> the child still there? </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking about the child she had fought so hard to conceive, her heart sank. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>The doctor</span><span> saved the child in your belly," Johnny said. He knew how important the child was to Amelia and had spared no effort to protect it. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's fortunate that the person who saved you provided timely treatment and prevented a miscarriage." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia looked at Johnny and, through his sincere eyes, finally dared to believe that the child was still there. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The fingers on her abdomen gradually softened, as if the child's presence made her feel less pain. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had been selfish, only thinking about finding James, never considering the child. But her child had never caused her morning sickness, nor had it abandoned her. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From beginning to end, it had been with her. This obedient child was Amelia's blessing in life, and she was determined to protect the child in the days to come. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Johnny," her voice was gentle and sweet, and when she called his name, it seemed to carry an electric current, making people feel numb. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Johnny felt that if he got any closer to her, he would be immersed in her and unable to extricate himself, but he was willing to indulge in it. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He gazed at Amelia's pale face for a while, then nodded gently. "Yes, I'm here." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia removed her fingers from her abdomen and sat up against the head of the bed, looking at him. "How did your father find me?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Was he just coincidentally on the deserted island?"</span></p></div>
