        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia and </span><span>Johnny</span><span> hadn't had a drop of water since the first round of the game, even if they were made of steel, they couldn't make it through.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Especially Amelia, she was very tired, but she couldn't fall asleep no matter what.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Johnny</span><span> wanted to go to the bathroom, but he couldn't because he was handcuffed, so he had to endure it curled up in a ball.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While both of them were feeling uncomfortable, the control panel in room nine opened again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, instead of a card slot, two meals were delivered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bread with milk and drinks, along with purified water, all for the players to eat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Johnny</span><span> pulled Amelia up and forced her to eat everything, then he asked her, "Accompany me to the bathroom."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After finishing the last glass of milk, Amelia put down the empty cup, looked in the direction of the bathroom, then looked back at him and said, "Let's go."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When they got to the bathroom, Amelia turned her back to </span><span>Johnny</span><span>, closed her eyes, and covered her ears with one hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Johnny</span><span> was in a hurry, but for some reason, he couldn't go once he was in the </span><span>bathroom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked back at Amelia and, torn between embarrassment and discomfort, chose to hold it in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He dragged Amelia out of the bathroom and then lay on the bed, covering his face with a blanket.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You can't keep doing this. There are still several rounds of games to go, you..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't talk nonsense, just go to sleep. Falling asleep will make it better."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Johnny</span><span> hadn't even drunk any water to make sure he didn't have to go to the bathroom, but it didn't help at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By the middle of the night, he couldn't take it anymore, so he woke Amelia up and urgently took her to the bathroom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he came out, he looked miserable, because who would want to do that in front of someone they liked?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He buried himself in the blanket, thinking that he would never let Amelia know that he liked her, absolutely not!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia was very tired and didn't remember anything, so she didn't even think about what happened in the bathroom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But </span><span>Johnny</span><span> was very concerned, and the next day he didn't even dare to talk to Amelia. She thought he was acting weird and didn't pay any attention to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next game in Erebus would start every week, and during the week, food and drinks would be provided, so the players were well taken care of.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia didn't know if they were being monitored all the time, but she took her medicine and ate on time to keep her energy and strength up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Johnny</span><span> always left milk and porridge for Amelia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though he had a big appetite himself, he always seemed worried that she wouldn't eat enough and forced her to eat more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia knew he was caring for her, and occasionally when he couldn't use his left hand, she would help him with his food.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But </span><span>Johnny</span><span> subconsciously pushed the plate back to her and said, "I'm full."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia looked at the plate of spaghetti and said, "Then I'll help you eat it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her baby in her belly was very well-behaved and didn't make her nauseous, but her appetite was increasing every day.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She even suspected that the baby she was carrying, like Grace, was a little foodie. Otherwise, why would she even snatch </span><span>Johnny</span><span>'s food?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Johnny</span><span> watched Amelia eating with a pleased smile on his face, as if this kind of life was not bad at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they got along better and better, the second round of the game officially started, still a choice game, but this time it was a card draw.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The scarred man still chose the same hall as them, and during specific time periods, he would give them the correct answers. This time, they both believed him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But when </span><span>Johnny</span><span> quietly asked the scarred man who sent him to protect them, the scarred man shook his head and gestured for him not to ask again, so </span><span>Johnny</span><span> stopped asking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the scarred man's help, they made it all the way to the seventh round.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By then, they had been in Erebus for over a month, witnessing many people making wrong choices and losing their lives.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For example, in the second round, a thigh was cut off, in the third round, a kidney was removed, in the fourth round, a heart was taken out, in the fifth round, someone was pushed into a frying pan, and in the sixth round, tendons were pulled out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The prize money for the three of them had accumulated to several billion dollars, and by the end, only the man who had his arm cut off at the beginning and them were left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After each round, Erebus would send the losing players back to their rooms and provide medication for them to treat themselves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Erebus's goal was to ensure the invited people could continue to place bets.</span></p></div>
