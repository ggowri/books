        <h1>Chapter 1762 James was controlled</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James stood still, listening to the ticking of the countdown in his head. After having his skull opened, a chip was implanted in his brain, monitoring his every move and word. He had just altered the program for the ninth round and bypassed the 1-1 setting to gain access. But as soon as he spoke, 1-2 discovered that he had tampered with the game area's program.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead of immediately triggering the explosion program, 1-2 gave him a five-minute countdown, giving him a chance. He couldn't speak out of turn and had to return within five minutes, or his brain would explode, and she would die.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James looked at the red targeting line aimed at Amelia's head and suddenly released his clenched fist. He picked up Amelia and carried her through the door, then held her shoulders to keep her still.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can't go back right now. You need to leave and not come looking for me. It's too dangerous," he said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His brain was controlled, and if he moved more than a hundred meters away from Erebus, it would automatically explode. James didn't want her to worry about him, so he quickly turned and walked out the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia didn't listen and tried to follow him, but James abruptly turned around.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I told you not to come looking for me. You didn't listen to me, and now you've killed </span><span>Johnny</span><span>. Isn't that enough?" he said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With just those words, Amelia froze in place, staring at him like a puppet, unable to say a word.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James didn't even look back as he left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she watched his indifferent figure, Amelia's tears flowed uncontrollably, and in that moment, she suddenly felt that everything was meaningless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Outside the door, James wiped away his tears and quickly went to the control panel on the fourth floor. He tried to open the program inside, frantically typing in the code.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The passage leading to the Erebus exit had a time limit, and James wanted to speed it up so that Amelia could leave before his brain exploded. But when he opened the control panel, he realized that the program for the door was set to send Amelia back to room 9, not out of Erebus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James quickly realized that it was because he had altered the </span><span>ninth round</span><span> program, ensuring that Amelia could choose the exit no matter what. 1-2 thought this affected the fairness of the bet and changed the program.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>1-2 didn't want Amelia to leave and wanted her to stay and continue challenging the </span><span>ninth round</span><span> game or other areas until it was fair. But James couldn't let Amelia be fooled by these people, so he had to crack 1-2's program in the remaining two minutes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for whether 1-2 would trigger the chip explosion program after he sent Amelia away, it didn't matter. He wanted her to live, even if he died.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James raced against time to crack 1-2's program, the countdown in his head like a death sentence. His slender fingers kept tapping the code, but the screen kept showing a red X.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought about how he had been harsh with her and now couldn't help her leave safely. Tears fell from his deep blue eyes onto his fingers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After seeing the red X on the screen again, a fierce anger filled his eyes. James clenched his fist and smashed it into the control panel, shattering the screen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was angry for only two seconds, but he refused to give up. He continued to type the code, but the ticking in his head reached 5 seconds, 4 seconds, 3 seconds, 2 seconds...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just when he thought time was about to run out, the ticking suddenly stopped, and a green safety passage indicator appeared on the program, showing that the passage to the Erebus exit was open, and Amelia could leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But this wasn't the result of his program alteration; someone was manipulating things behind the scenes. James's handsome eyebrows furrowed as a sharp and familiar female voice came from behind him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Cobra, I have the authority to prevent your brain from exploding and to ensure her safe departure. 1-2 has given the access, how about making a deal with me?"</span></p></div>
