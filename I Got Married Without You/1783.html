        <h1>Chapter 1783 1-1 and 1-3 arrived</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Two men wearing full-face masks and protective suits pushed open the door to the chip room and saw James sitting on the sofa like a king, motionless as a mountain. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was covered in blood, and his face, slightly turned, was also stained with blood. Only his lifeless eyes exuded a cold, disdainful gaze. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By his side was a surgical knife, its blade glinting silver under the light, casting an eerie glow on the man's face, making him look like a demon from hell. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it were anyone else who saw 1-1 and 1-3, they would have been afraid, but the man on the sofa showed no fear, not even bothering to acknowledge their presence. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His stubbornness and unruliness were somewhat admirable to the two founders, but... "If you are not the leader of S, then I would definitely have a different opinion of you for single-handedly making it to the upper area," said 1-1, his voice carrying a hint of weariness, as if it had been tempered by the passage of time. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tell me, what are you doing in Erebus?" 1-1 pulled up a chair and sat down in front of James as if meeting an old friend. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without any defenses, James took the cigarette offered to him and lit it. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had relied on cigarettes to survive during the years she was ill, and when she </span><span>returned, he quit smoking for good. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now that she was gone, these things seemed to have no meaning worth quitting for. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He took a drag from the cigarette, exhaling a puff of smoke. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under the swirling smoke, the man's face, both ethereal and blood-stained, was half-hidden, revealing no emotion. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After staring at him for a while, 1-1 lit a cigarette, but did not smoke it, just held it in his hand, absentmindedly toying with it. "If you're not willing to talk, then according to Erebus's rules, I'll have to send you to the biochemistry area," said 1-1. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James took the cigarette out of his mouth and blew out a wisp of smoke. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This action seemed somewhat provocative to 1-3, who was standing by the door with his arms crossed. "Aren't you afraid of death with such arrogance?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James looked past 1-3 and at Nick, who was standing next to him. "You don't care about his life?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nick, enduring intense pain, looked up at 1-1's back. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>1-1 had entrusted Erebus to him, but he had failed to manage it and was now being controlled by James. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>1-1 hated S even more than he did, and now the leader of S was right in front of him. Would 1-1 still care about the life of his partner? </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I do," said 1-1. These two words made Nick breathe a sigh of relief. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But before he could express his gratitude, 1-3 shot him in the head. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sound of the gunshot stunned the black-clad men waiting outside. Nick, lying on the ground, looked at 1-3 in disbelief. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why..." 1-3 raised the gun and, behind his mask, blew away the smoke rising from the barrel. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"By killing you, we won't be threatened anymore." He put down the gun, bent down, and patted Nick's pale face. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nick probably never expected that after dedicating his life to Erebus, he would end up being killed by a junior. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked at 1-1, who had been watching the whole time, with regret and resentment, then spat out several mouthfuls of blood before slowly closing his eyes. </span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>showed no remorse for his death, only raised his hand to have the body taken away. After Nick was taken away, 1-1 turned his gaze to James, who had been coldly observing the situation. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You knew I would kill him?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If it were me, I would have done the same," James replied. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This answer pleased 1-1. If their positions were different, James would have been the person he admired the most. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Since you knew I would kill Nick, why did you use the chip to torture him?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I wanted to find someone." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wanted to use Nick's authority to find the Moore father and daughter. As for threatening 1-1... </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he could, that would be great. If not, it didn't matter, as the result would be the same.</span></p></div>
