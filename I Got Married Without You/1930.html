        <h1>Chapter 1930 A chip in the brain</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After sitting down by the bedside, Ryan spoke to Amelia in a gentle and calm voice, recounting how Amelia and James met, fell in love, and faced life and death together.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After listening, Amelia was momentarily stunned, but quickly regained her composure and said, "Ryan, these things feel like a story, not something I can endure."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ryan smiled faintly, his lips curling up. "When I lost my memory, you came to find me and told me about our relationship. It felt like a story to me too, so I resisted accepting the unfamiliar memories I didn't have. But..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ryan paused and sighed deeply. "When I regained my memory, it was too late. I could only watch you fall in love with someone else, be with someone else, and I lost my chance..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Amelia could respond, Ryan interrupted her. "Amelia, I'm telling you all this not to bring you back to me, but to tell you not to let amnesia control you. Don't push away the person you love. I don't want you to regret it like I did."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She lowered her gaze, thinking of James' desperate look, feeling a sense of unfamiliarity, yet sensing his deep love for her. She was momentarily lost in confusion.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Furrowing her brows, she tried hard to remember anything related to him, but couldn't. The more she tried, the more it hurt.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her head felt like it was exploding, and the pain spread to her entire body, reopening all her wounds...</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She eventually fainted from the pain, causing Ryan to panic and call for the doctor. Eva, who had rushed over with the baby, saw Amelia faint again and turned pale.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After the doctor rushed in to save her, Amelia remained unconscious.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Dr. Lewis was speechless. "The patient has amnesia, and you all are too eager to stimulate her. If you want her to regain her memory, you need to take it step by step..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva quickly dismissed the idea of using the baby to stimulate Amelia. "So, what's her current condition? Is it just a temporary fainting spell, or is she back to being unconscious like before?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The doctor replied, "It's just a temporary fainting spell. She should wake up soon, but you shouldn't stimulate her anymore. Let the patient's body recover first..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing that she would wake up, both Eva and Ryan breathed a sigh of relief. After the doctor left, Ryan felt apologetic. "James came, but Amelia still couldn't remember him. I told her about their relationship, but I didn't expect her to..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva glanced at Ryan and then looked down at the baby in her arms. "Ryan, right now Amelia only remembers things before she turned eighteen. It's quite cruel for James. Maybe, for the sake of Amelia's child, you should temporarily step back?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, when Amelia was eighteen, it was the time she loved Ryan the most and the easiest time in her life.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>During that time, she had just undergone heart surgery and her heart condition had improved. She had also been accepted into university.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva thought that Amelia only remembered things before that time because there had been so much good news that year.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although she had James' love in the future, it was also quite exhausting for Amelia.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ryan, who had the same thought, didn't blame Eva for being straightforward. Instead, he nodded gently. "After she wakes up, please send me a message."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva held back her tears and didn't look at Ryan. She simply said softly, "Okay, from now on..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ryan felt touched and didn't let Eva say the difficult words. "From now on... I won't come anymore, Eva. Please take care of Amelia."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying that, Ryan looked deeply at the unconscious Amelia, turned around, and walked out of the hospital room.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps he couldn't bear it, as he turned back after a few steps. This one glance was their farewell.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva held the baby and when Amelia woke up, Paul's call came in. "Eva, James fainted and is being treated at the hospital. Please go see what's going on with him. I'll come over right away."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva didn't expect James to faint and quickly called a nurse to take care of the baby before rushing out of the room to find the emergency room where James was.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Andrew and Peter standing weakly by the door of the emergency room, Eva leaned against the wall and asked, out of breath, "Andrew, why did he suddenly faint?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing Eva's voice, Andrew turned around. "Isn't it because Mrs. Evans said she doesn't love Mr. Evans anymore, only loves Ryan, and wants to start over with Ryan? That's why he fainted in front of the hospital."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That's what they all thought until the door of the emergency room opened and the doctor walked out. "Why does Mr. Evans have a chip in his brain?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Andrew and Peter were taken aback, then furrowed their brows. "A chip? What chip?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva was equally confused. "He has a chip in his brain? Can he still survive? Are we mistaken?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The doctor handed them the imaging report. "Take a look for yourselves."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When the three of them saw the chip displayed on the imaging report, they were all stunned. "What's going on? How could Mr. Evans have something like this in his brain?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The doctor shook his head. "I'm not sure. The head of the department asked me to ask if you want it removed now."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as they were about to agree, Paul, who had rushed over, urgently stopped them. "No, it can't be removed!"</span></p></div>
