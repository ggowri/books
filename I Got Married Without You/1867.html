        <h1>Chapter 1867 You're my aunt's child?</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carson's expression froze, looking somewhat bewildered, as he gazed at the emotionless James. "What do you mean?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He is Ashley's child, don't you know?" Holden's casual words left Carson completely stunned. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aren't you Gloria's child?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carson found it hard to believe, looking James up and down. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Based on appearances alone, there was nothing to indicate their connection, except for James' eyes... </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon closer inspection, there was a sense of detachment and aloofness, reminiscent of Ashley. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Ashley he remembered always carried a hint of coldness, as if she didn't care about anything in the world. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James, standing not far away, seemed the same. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The more Carson looked, the more he saw the resemblance between the two, and his initial disbelief gradually softened. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No wonder you called me uncle earlier." He had thought it was because of Amelia, that James also referred to him as uncle, but it turned out James had known about their relationship all along. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you already knew I was your uncle, why didn't you tell me earlier?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James cast a reproachful gaze at Carson, shifting his eyes from Holden to Carson in the distance. "There was no need."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James' cold voice, to Carson's ears, was all too familiar. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But to Johnny, it was like a thunderbolt. "You're my aunt's child?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If James was his aunt's child, then he was James' cousin?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Johnny's eyes widened in shock, unable to believe what he was hearing, as he stared at James beside him. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But if James was his cousin, then Amelia would be his cousin-in-law. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Realizing this, Johnny felt a pang in his heart. "No matter if you're my aunt's child or not, I can never acknowledge you as my cousin!" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James, tilting his head slightly, tugged at the corners of his thin lips, letting out a faint scoff. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Whether you acknowledge it or not, you still have to address my wife as your cousin-in-law." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"..." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Johnny's face instantly turned sour. It was already frustrating enough to like someone who was married, but now that person suddenly became his cousin-in-law...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, nobody paid any attention to Johnny's anger. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both sides were confused by this sudden revelation of their relationship. "Venom, he's your nephew. Should we still fight?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carson looked at the other side, hesitating for a moment before putting aside his memories and taking a step forward, stepping on the broken branches on the ground. "Although we have a blood relation, our positions are still hostile." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James, who had long expected this outcome, raised his slender finger and pressed it forward as Carson's words fell. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The S members behind him immediately drew their guns and aimed at Carson and the person behind him. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the instant the S members drew their guns, the people on Carson's side also drew their guns. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both sides were now on edge, and with a single command, a hail of bullets would erupt. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Carson's side only held their guns, aiming at James, and never gave the order. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Holden, seeing this scene, knew that Carson was hesitating and spoke again. "Mr. Clark, even if you don't consider our family ties, you should think about your subordinates." "Erebus only let you intercept us because they want to sacrifice you." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a brief reminder, Holden's gaze shifted from Carson to the group of armed men in black. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In terms of numbers, your side is outnumbered, and in terms of weapons, you don't have the advantage." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You should know that with our manpower and strength, we can easily turn you into Swiss cheese." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Instead of being sacrificed for Matty, it's better to think about yourselves." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carson glanced at his subordinates behind him, then turned back to look at the hundreds of masked members behind James.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But betraying Erebus at this moment seemed difficult for him to do.</span></p></div>
