        <h1>Chapter 1741 The key is missing</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia was awakened by the noise, and slowly opened her eyes to see an endless expanse of white - a white ceiling, white walls, white floor, and nothing else. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The bright white light from the ceiling was blinding, and as she raised her hand to shield her eyes, she heard the sound of handcuffs moving. She looked over and saw Johnny lying next to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia pushed Johnny, wondering if he had offended Erebus's people. Johnny had been injected with a much heavier dose of sedatives, and despite her efforts, he didn't react. She looked around the room, which was all white and had two white beds, looking very clean and tidy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't see any electronic devices as Holden had described, so they must have been hidden somewhere. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She got up from the floor and sat against the wall, waiting quietly for Erebus to announce the rules. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But after waiting for a long time, she realized that no one was coming, and there wasn't even a door. However, to her surprise, Erebus had brought her suitcase into the room as well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When she saw her suitcase in the corner, she subconsciously touched her stomach. She didn't feel any discomfort from the sedatives, so Erebus's people must have shown mercy towards her. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But why? Emily had lured her into this, wanting to harm her. Why would Erebus's people show kindness to her?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She couldn't understand it, but regardless, she was now in the place where James had disappeared, and she believed she would see him soon. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She just didn't know what to say to him when she saw him. Should she tell him they finally had a child, or just say, "Honey, I miss you"?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she thought about this, she moved her hand from her stomach to the shiny white floor, hoping to see James soon. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, Johnny, who was lying next to her, stirred slightly, pulling her attention back to him. He was groaning in pain and holding his arm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia moved her hand to touch him, and Johnny opened his eyes to see her white face. She asked about the key to the handcuffs, and Johnny, still groggy, searched for it but only found a gold leaf. He couldn't find the key and was confused as to where it had gone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His handsome face showed a hint of confusion, and his sleepy eyes were filled with bewilderment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Strange, I remember the key was definitely here, how did it disappear?"</span></p></div>
