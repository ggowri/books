        <h1>Chapter 1718 The first letter</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the 30</span><span style="vertical-align: super;">th</span><span> day, the last night, Amelia stood outside the castle, staring at the time on her watch. When the hands pointed to 00:00, there was still no sign of the black car that James had left in on the road to Blue Bay Island...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her anxious heart sank suddenly, and her feet seemed to have a mind of their own as she walked towards the end of the darkness. She wanted to see if there were any cars coming up from the bottom of the mountain, but Peter blocked her path.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ma'am, danger!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"James reminded him to always stick close to Amelia, no matter where or when. He must never leave her side, especially during this time. Peter will keep his distance while they are in the castle, but at all other times, he will be right by her side."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He didn't come back on time, so how could I possibly care about any danger?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia pushed away Peter's hand and ran down the mountain without a care, feeling certain that if she just kept running, she would eventually find James.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she ran all the way to the end where the mountain road meets the highway, and still didn't see James' car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She stood there, dazed, with a pair of empty, lifeless eyes, staring at the passing cars...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't even have a way to contact him, let alone know where he went. How was she supposed to find him?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Peter, who had been following her all along, was also restless and furrowed his brow, staring at the passing vehicles...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As two people stood at the intersection, the sky began to drizzle again. Summer had passed and the rainy autumn season had arrived. The rain wasn't heavy, just a light pitter-patter that fell onto the long, loose hair behind them, giving it a chilly misty appearance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Peter glanced at the rain pouring down from the night sky and then at Amelia, who was dressed in thin clothes. He wanted to persuade her to go back, but he knew it would be useless. So he decisively took off his jacket and handed it to Amelia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ma'am, it's pouring rain, please use my clothes to cover yourself."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia remained still, like an abandoned puppet, devoid of any signs of life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Peter saw that she had no reaction, hesitated for a few seconds, and then unfolded his clothes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ma'am, please forgive me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then he lifted his suit jacket and covered it over her head, shielding her from the wind and rain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Will Peter not come back?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a long time, Amelia suddenly asked this question.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Peter knew where Mr. Shawn had gone, but he couldn't tell Amelia. All he could do was comfort her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No way, Mr. Shawn will definitely come back," she reassured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Mr. Shawn was about to leave, Peter asked him why he didn't take him along, so that he could have an extra person to protect him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Shawn insisted that instead of protecting him, he would rather have Peter protect Amelia, because she is his everything."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Peter stayed behind to protect Amelia and wait for Mr. Shawn's return, risking his own life for his boss. He silently stood by her side, shielding her from harm and patiently waiting for Mr. Shawn to come back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Will he come back?'</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Amelia murmured softly, not sure if she was asking Peter or herself. All she knew was that she felt completely drained."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She hugged her arms tightly and slowly crouched down, gazing into the distance at the vehicles, hoping that one of them would be James's, but his car never appeared...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As time passed by, Amelia's heart grew more and more desperate...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't know how long had passed when a white car suddenly stopped in front of her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as Amelia saw a pair of black leather boots in the passenger seat, her heart tightened and she sat up abruptly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"James!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What appeared before my eyes was a completely unfamiliar face, not the sharp features I remembered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the moment of touching the other person, Amelia's excited heart suddenly cooled down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Are you Mrs. Evans?'</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia clenched her fists, looking at the other person with suspicion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who are you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm here on behalf of Mr. Evans to check in and make sure everything is okay."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia suddenly remembered that James had said if he didn't come back in a month, he would send someone to check in on her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I am his wife."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she eagerly nodded, the man finally took out a pink envelope and handed it to Amelia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is from Mr. Evans, he asked me to give it to you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She quickly reached out and took it, then swiftly tore open the envelope and pulled out the letter inside, unfolding it hastily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Amelia, I'm sorry, I broke my promise and didn't come back on time. Please wait for me for two more months, I will definitely return."</span></p></div>
