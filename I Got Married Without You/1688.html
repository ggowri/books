        <h1>Chapter 1688 Emily appeared again</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emily, surrounded by a group of black-clad bodyguards, paused as if by chance at the pier, glanced in the direction of the ship, and then turned around to scan James' car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Through the thick car window tint, James saw her face, with a cross-shaped scar that glowed red in the intense sunlight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emily didn't deliberately cover it up or avoid it, but intentionally lifted her face for him to see, as if reminding him that he had left that scar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Mr. Ben and Brandon by her side, she appeared openly in front of him, just to let him know that James, one day, I will avenge this scar!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James had a special identity and had never publicly revealed Amelia as his wife. In public situations like this with the media present, they would separate and go their own ways. Amelia had already boarded the ship.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Emily board the ship with so many people, James understood Emily's goal was Amelia. With this in mind, James immediately pushed open the car door, but Emily changed direction and walked away...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When James abruptly stopped, Emily suddenly turned back and gave him a mysterious smile. That smile meant she wasn't targeting Amelia today, but rather testing him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A hint of killing intent flashed in James' cold eyes. Without hesitation, he quickly caught up with Emily, accompanied by his bodyguards.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Last time, he didn't personally deal with Emily and handed her over to Zack. But Zack, being busy, handed her over to Mr. Ben, which led to Mr. Ben's betrayal. This time, James must personally end them!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the ship, Amelia had already recognized Emily when she turned around, but from a distance, she couldn't see the scar on her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since The Moore Group was acquired by The Evans', Emily and Brandon had disappeared. When Amelia saw them, her heart skipped a beat. If she didn't know her own identity, she wouldn't have felt anything. But now she knew that Brandon was her biological father and Emily was her half-sister.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Of course, what made her even more complicated was why James was following Emily?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After everything Amelia had been through with James, she didn't think he was still involved with Emily. She was just puzzled by it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, Ryan boarded the ship and saw her standing on the deck, gazing into the distance. Her pale face regained some color. "Amelia."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing Ryan's voice, Amelia snapped out of her thoughts and turned to look at him. Ryan was still sitting in his wheelchair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia glanced at the direction James had disappeared in again, suppressing her worries, and walked towards Ryan. "Ryan, how are your legs?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ryan touched his leg. "I can feel pain now. The nerves seem to be recovering. I believe I'll be able to stand after rehabilitation."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva had already told her that Ryan would be able to stand, but hearing it from Ryan himself, Amelia felt relieved. "I wish you a speedy recovery then."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ryan nodded and there was nothing else to say between them. From being dependent </span><span>on each other to becoming strangers over the years, only memories were left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even the memories were Ryan's alone. The woman before him was already occupied by another man in her heart and mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ryan tightened his fingers on his knee and smiled at Amelia. "Amelia, I'm going to give Eva a wedding gift. I'll take my leave."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The words "take my leave" sounded distant. Amelia thought there was no need to deliberately maintain a distance, but her heart was with James, so she had no intention of comforting Ryan at the moment. She just nodded at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Ryan left, Amelia quickly turned around, facing the direction of the pier, clutching her hand, standing still. When the media had left and the ship was about to leave, James still hadn't returned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James had a special identity and often had mysterious missions to attend to. Amelia knew not to disturb him when he was working, but she was very worried about him. Afraid that something might happen to him, after hesitating for a few seconds, she disembarked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva had just walked over, wanting to take a few more photos of Amelia. When she saw Amelia getting off the ship, she quickly followed. "Amelia, are you going to call James to board the ship?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia was about to say yes when she saw James, accompanied by bodyguards, appear in her line of sight. Seeing his cold and noble figure, Amelia's heart, which had been in her throat, finally relaxed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She lifted her dress skirt and ran towards James, disregarding everything, and the man quickly stopped his steps, raising his strong arms to catch the woman throwing herself into his embrace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia nestled in his arms, smelling the faint scent of cedar emanating from him, her tense body gradually softening. "Husband, from now on, please let me know wherever you go, okay?"</span></p></div>
