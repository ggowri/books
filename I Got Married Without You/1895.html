        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Johnny's face turned pale with anger. "Get out of here!" he shouted. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Herb tightened his seatbelt, rebellious look on his face. "I won't!" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Johnny was about to kick him, James in the backseat glanced at the front. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your sister-in-law is pregnant, please focus on driving and stop arguing."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two almost quarreling brats immediately quieted down. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Johnny slowed down the car and suppressed the urge to kick Herb, driving in silence to the church. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gigi was at the church, attending the afternoon service. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every day, she would come to read the Bible, thinking of Zack. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gradually, her heavy heart began to calm down. But every night in her dreams, she would be awakened by Zack in her dreams. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Losing a loved one was a painful experience that couldn't be easily forgotten in just a day or two. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Many times, Gigi would sit by the window, gazing at the night sky and the bright moon, sitting there all night. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She stared at the stars, starting to believe that people turned into stars after death. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She believed that the stars she saw with her naked eyes must be the transformation of Zack, always entering her sight and following her. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With this deception, she comforted herself and waited for Zack. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And sure enough, Zack came as promised.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gigi remembered kneeling in front of the church, closing her eyes and praying for Zack, when a clear and pure voice, untainted by the world, sounded in her ears. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The person asked the priest, "Why am I restless day and night lately?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The priest replied, "There must be something you desire but cannot obtain." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The person asked again, "Is there a way to resolve it?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The priest said, "It all depends on you to resolve it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the person spoke, he noticed Gigi, with tears streaming down her face, looking at him with her tearful and aggrieved eyes, piercing his heart. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, the priest's voice disappeared, his ears fell silent, and even his eyes were devoid of any color. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All he saw was a woman kneeling on the ground, silently shedding tears. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Until she shook her frail body, took difficult steps, and walked in front of him, trembling fingers caressing his face, did he snap out of it. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The person took a step back, but Gigi, thinking it was Zack who had returned, hugged him without hesitation. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zenith vaguely looked at Gigi, feeling somewhat familiar, but it was just a fleeting moment. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He pushed her away and told her she had mistaken him for someone else. Gigi looked at the face in front of her, identical to Zack's, and couldn't believe it. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She approached Zenith several times, grabbing his arm and telling him that he had said if she prayed in the church for a year and still hadn't forgotten him, he would come to her in a different form. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now that she hadn't forgotten and he had come in this form, how could it be wrong? </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gigi asked Zenith to wait for her, she went back to get her phone to show him the evidence he had left behind. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But by the time she returned with her phone, Zenith had already left the church. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gigi stood in the vast church, looking around in confusion, but couldn't find Zack's figure anymore. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her eyes suddenly stung, and tears poured down as she squatted down, hugging her knees. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She cried and muttered to herself, "Zack, is it because I didn't protect our baby well that you appeared and left again? But..." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She paused, not making any more excuses for her mistakes. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She just murmured over and over again, softly whispering, "Zack, come back, let's have another child, okay?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It rarely rained in Barcelona, and when it did, it came suddenly, without waiting for the clouds to darken. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The dry rain fell, and Gigi crouched under the steps, with no shelter from the rain. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The rain soaked her entire body. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When her hair was wet, a transparent white umbrella appeared above her head. Zack, in Gigi's eyes, stood tall in front of her, like a life-saving straw, blocking the rain in time, giving her a sense of hope for life.</span></p></div>
