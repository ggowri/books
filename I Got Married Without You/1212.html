        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing this, Amelia remembered James&rsquo; reaction to the report earlier, which was not very enthusiastic. This made her subconsciously glance at James.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man beside her, however, showed no guilty conscience and instead refuted Dominic expressionlessly, "Believe it or not, I'm just here to inform you that my wife and I have no blood relation. Don't meddle in our affairs in the future."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After speaking, the man pulled her away. The old man's cold snort came from behind, "Your mother's name is Ashley, she's Adam's daughter, and her mother's name is Sumasa, also born to Adam. Do you think I'll believe your DNA report that says you have no blood relation?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia stopped in her tracks upon hearing this and turned to look at Dominic, who was sitting upright and serious. "Mr. Evans, I told you before that my mother is most likely not from the Clark family. If she's not from the Clark family, then James and I naturally have no blood relation."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dominic gave her a glance. "You said it's most likely. Don't tell me something uncertain like that. I want evidence."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia asked him, "So if I can prove that my mother is not from the Clark family, you won't interfere in our affairs anymore?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dominic nodded subconsciously along with her words. By the time he realized it, A had already smiled brightly. "Okay, I'll go get the evidence now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing that confident smile, Dominic wanted to say something about the matter of child, which he still had to intervene in, but he saw Amelia walking away with James.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How rude, she didn't even wait for me to finish talking."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Coming and going in a hurry, what do they think the Evans family mansion is?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After the two got into the car, J helped her fasten her seatbelt and asked her, "How are you going to get the evidence?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia smirked and replied, "It's simple. Herb and I will do another identification test to prove that I am not from the Clark family."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It's just a process of elimination. This way, we can quickly find out which one of their mothers is not from the Clark family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia suspected that Sumasa was not from the Clark family, so she and Herb went to do the test, and James didn't need to go.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But how can they get a strand of Herb's hair?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With this in mind, Amelia took out her phone, found Herb's number, and sent him a text message to arrange a meeting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James saw this and her bright eyes dimmed slightly. "Why bother with all this trouble? Just kidnap him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That's too crude and violent for Amelia's taste. "We only need one strand of hair. Do we really need to be so rough with your cousin?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The word "cousin" made James pause for a moment, as if he had just realized something. "He's my cousin, so Jonny is..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia smiled and nodded. "That's right. Jonny is also your cousin. How do you feel about suddenly having two younger brothers? Isn't it wonderful?"</span></p></div>
