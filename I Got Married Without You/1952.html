        <h1>Chapter 1952 The Angry Johnny</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Alexander turned five, a series of events happened. Herb encountered a genius at the casino and made an attempt to outwit him, only to be defeated. Eventually, clad only in his underwear, he was taken away by Carson.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as James had taught Alexander a lesson, Carson severely beat Herb with a stick. Overwhelmed by shame, Herb never went to a casino again.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, in secret, he imparted his gambling expertise to Alexander, who initially lacked interest in any pursuit. Afterward, Herb's tutelage intrigued Alexander, though not in the realm of gambling. Instead, his focus shifted toward decryption.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander would accept any decryption toys Herb brought over. Then, he would sit on the carpet in the study room and play with them cross-legged in silence. Every time Alexander was absorbed in these toys, Herb would blame James for beating Alexander silly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James asked Herb to go back to the Clark family and refrain from interfering in Alexander's affairs, but Herb refused to leave and stayed at Blue Bay Island. In response, James resorted to physical force, slapping Herb, who ultimately returned to his hometown. Deeply aggrieved, Herb complained to Carson about it but faced another beating again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Herb had been idle, prompting Carson to hasten his maturation by entrusting him with the Clark family's underground operations. After several harrowing fights with foreign gangs that brought him close to death, Herb underwent a transformation, forsaking his former penchant for bullying and brawling. He pivoted toward assuming control of the Clark family's legitimate enterprises for the straightforward reason of evading further physical harm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the past two years, Johnny had been spearheading the Brook Group's expansion into North Auriolia. However, as luck would have it, Sebastian was also competing for dominance in the same market. Feeling remorseful for James, the Lawrence family proactively gave up the profits to Sebastian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Learning that Sebastian had won many projects in North Auriolia, Johnny, in a rage, headed to Verodian in person to invite Dylan out for "coffee".</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that time, Dylan, after five years of efforts, took over Owen's position and became the president of the Lawrence Group and the head of the Lawrence family. Under his vigorous and decisive leadership, the Lawrence family reached a new height in North Auriolia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The fact that he was able to come and see Johnny in person was already a sign of respect. Otherwise, given his current level of influence, Dylan could have sent a general secretary to deal with Johnny. He came, however, in person, on account of some connection and friendship between Johnny and himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ignoring how powerful Dylan was, Johnny grumbled, "In the last bidding meeting, it was obvious that the AI robots developed by the Brook family were better, but you gave the project to Sebastian. Such favoritism is unjustifiable!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dylan took a sip of coffee and stared at the angry Johnny with a half-smile. "The robots of Brook Group were indeed very good, but compared with the Evans family's samples, they still lacked some commercial viability. It's understandable that I assigned the project to Sebastian."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Johnny, sitting opposite him, sneered, "Don't be so hypocritical. By repeatedly awarding the projects to the Evans family, you've facilitated their swift entry into the North Auriolia market. Isn't it because Amelia married James?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Johnny was unwilling to maintain a semblance of harmony, Dylan did not bother to talk nonsense. He put down the glass and retorted, "Yes, my sister and James are wife and husband. Of course, I will help them instead of you, an outsider."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dylan wasn't stupid.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Johnny rolled his eyes in exasperation. "If you had another sister, I would get hitched with her right now. Let's see whether you will help James or me in the future!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing this, Dylan suspected that Johnny's intentions in coming were beyond the project, prompting him to raise his bushy eyebrows. "I have several adopted sisters. Why don't you marry one?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Johnny was startled. Realizing that he had fallen into the ruse of his earlier statement, he quickly waved his hand in refusal. "My father has his own opinion on my marriage, so never mind that."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dylan frowned with displeasure, "Why? Mr. Brook, do you disdain my sisters?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Johnny smiled awkwardly, "How could it be?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dylan said, "In this case, I'll call my sisters over and let you have a look."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Johnny, cornered, touched his nose. "Feel free to call them, but I must emphasize that if they're not attractive, I'm not interested."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dylan, perhaps intentionally teasing Johnny or for other reasons, retrieved his cell phone, sent a message, and genuinely invited his adopted sisters over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They sat across from Johnny one by one, as if it were a beauty pageant. Johnny was caught off guard. His original plan was for business, but now it seemed he was unintentionally on a wife-hunting mission.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Johnny was speechless. "Mr. Lawrence, your sisters are all pretty, but they are not as stunning as Amelia. I don't like them, so forget it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dylan sized Johnny up meaningfully. "Mr. Brook, do you like a good-looking girl or Amelia?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Johnny paused, holding the coffee cup, and reminisced about his initial encounter with Amelia, where he had cornered her and looked down at her. He pondered the emotions he had experienced at that time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite his prosopagnosia, he was undoubtedly surprised. What was the reason? It was her beauty that captivated him and made a lasting impression on him at first sight.</span></p></div>
