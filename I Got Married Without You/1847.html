        <h1>Chapter 1847: Little Elvira, I'm Sorry</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia didn't meet up with Brandon because in her eyes, he was no father and not worth her time. She watched him and Emily on the surveillance camera, meeting in the game area.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brandon seemed to adore Emily, hugging her the moment he saw her and assuring her that everything would be alright with him around. He had the image of a father, but never showed it to Ginger or Amelia. To him, Emily was the only child that mattered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Understanding this, Amelia felt relieved. Some people just never experience fatherly love, and that's okay.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The game in the lower area started quickly. The two breezed through challenges, facing no penalties. Each victory was celebrated with tears of joy and a tight embrace, as if their lives were the only ones that mattered, and Amelia's was expendable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Watching this made Amelia uncomfortable. She was about to switch off the monitor when Emily's scream echoed from the speaker.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What the hell? How could I get it wrong? That's impossible!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were at the seventh round, where a wrong choice meant entering the snake pit. The door to the pit didn't drop from beneath but opened like a death door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emily stared in disbelief at the opening death door, her eyes flicking to the surveillance camera.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why?" she asked just before a robot arm shot out from the death door, heading straight for her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dad, quickly, save me!" Terrified, Emily turned to run towards Brandon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Emily, I..." Brandon hesitated, even stepping back in fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dad, I'm your daughter, the one you've always loved. Why won't you save me?" Emily was deeply disappointed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After hesitation, Brandon grabbed Emily and started running, simultaneously pleading with Amelia through the surveillance camera. "Amelia, I saved you before. Please spare us."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Torn between the tragic lives of </span><span>Sumasa</span><span> and Ginger, Amelia was unsure on what to do.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just scare them a little and dump them in the sea. Let's stop playing." She finally said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As cruel as the game was, Amelia didn't want to continue. But as she stopped, the man in black pressed the speed-up button instead of the pause.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop the game, let them out."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia expected the man in black to press the pause button, but he mistakenly pressed the speed up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Almost instantly, the robot arm extended quickly towards the </span><span>Moores</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emily quickly let go of Brandon's hand and, gathering all her strength, pushed him </span><span>towards the robot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Brandon was lifted by the robot and dropped into the snake pit, the sound of hissing snakes filled the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shaking in fear, Emily backed away from the pit, apologizing to her father.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dad, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to. I had no choice."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brandon, now being strangled by a snake, looked at Emily. It was only then that he felt her malice and remembered Amelia's gentle face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked at the surveillance camera inside the snake pit, mouthing, "Little Elvira, I'm sorry..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just after he spoke, a small snake slithered into his mouth. Brandon choked twice before he stopped breathing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia, watching from the surveillance monitor, was shocked into tears. She didn't know why she was crying - maybe she was scared, or maybe she understood Brandon's last words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Or maybe she was mourning for him, betrayed by his own beloved daughter just to survive. She wondered if Brandon regretted anything from his past.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But regrets meant nothing now. Brandon was dead, and the score was settled. As for Emily...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After mumbling a few apologies, she left the death door, backed away and slowly slid down against the cold white wall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dad, blame Amelia. If she hadn't made us play this game, you wouldn't have died. She's the one who killed you, remember to haunt her as a ghost!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emily, clutching her arm, felt no remorse as she shifted all the blame to Amelia, as if Amelia was the one who pushed Brandon into the snake pit, not her.</span></p></div>
