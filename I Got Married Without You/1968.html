        <h1>Chapter 1968 The Reason for Demeanor Changed</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander originally had a bit of a tyrant's temperament and liked to bully others, but after a lesson from James, his demeanor changed drastically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't reasonably be described as James, but the main thing was that even at his young age, he always looked at the people around him with a condescending gaze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wasn't much for talking, either. Most of the time, when Amelia spoke to him, he just listened silently and never responded or argued back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia worried that the older he got, the more introverted he would become, so she hired a psychologist. "Before Alexander turned three, he was quite lively and even a bit mischievous at times, but now he doesn't even smile."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She also wondered if it was because James had hit him two years ago, causing severe psychological trauma, that Alexander had changed so much.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's nature, driven by an admiration for strength, suggested that he was unlikely to be haunted by psychological trauma. His mindset was such that he only respected and trusted the strong, dismissing the weak with disdain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The psychologist, Chloe MacAdam, heard about Alexander's background and asked Amelia, "Does he show interest in anything in particular?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia thought for a moment and replied, "He's interested in picture books, puzzle toys, and anything to do with technology or medicine. But once he understands something, he loses interest quickly. It's just a passing fascination."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chloe nodded understandingly. "Where is him now? I'd like to see him and talk to him first, to determine whether he is exceptionally intelligent or if there really are psychological issues."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia gestured towards the castle. "He's usually in the study, sitting on the floor by the wall with a book. He can sit there all day."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they entered the castle, Chloe was surprised, turning her head to ask, "Your child is only five and can already read fluently?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia had placed great importance on linguistic education due to her challenges. So, she had invested early in her child's education. "Before he started at the international kindergarten, we had already hired a tutor to teach him to read. It's strange. He remembers everything he reads. Plus, everyone at home communicates with him in bilingual, so he's quite proficient in both languages now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia had somewhat held back in her remarks. James, being multilingual, had put in more effort than the children in Paul's family ever did. Paul had tried several times to outdo James but never succeeded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Alexander turned five, he was hardly cooperative and showed no interest in learning. It seemed that James' persistent efforts eventually paid off, as Alexander could switch between languages effortlessly. However, he was not much of a talker, which was quite frustrating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Chloe listened, she surveyed the castle's interior. Her eyes were drawn to the crystal chandelier hanging from the living room ceiling, which hinted at how much Amelia had held back in her conversation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Knowing how the wealthy raised their children, Chloe nodded subtly at Amelia and followed her to the child's study.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Pushing the door open, they were greeted by a sun-drenched room. Although it was a study, it was spacious, with rows of bookshelves filled with books and models.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These weren't ordinary toy models but high-tech prototypes developed by the Evans Group over the years, ranging from airplanes and ships to robots and spacecraft.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Near the floor-to-ceiling window, in the farthest corner, Alexander, dressed in a little suit and white shirt, sat under a bookshelf engrossed in a spaceship model.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander lifted his icy eyes suddenly when he sensed an intrusion into his private realm. If not for seeing Amelia enter behind Chloe, Alexander might have shown anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia led Chloe to Alexander and then crouched down, softly saying, "Alexander, she is my best friend and she really likes you. She's here to chat with you, is that okay?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander glanced at Amelia, and seeing her expectant eyes, he slowly shifted his gaze to Chloe. His look was somewhat disdainful, but out of respect for Amelia's kindness, he nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia raised her hand to touch Alexander's hair, combed back at the nape of his neck. Though he rarely spoke to anyone and had a reserved and proud demeanor, he was always obliging whenever she asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In Amelia's eyes, such a child was naturally well-behaved, but fearing he might become introverted, she had consulted a psychologist. Otherwise, Amelia would never entertain the thought that there might be something wrong with her child's mental state.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No mother could bear such a thought. Tenderly, Amelia stroked Alexander's head before she stood up and left the study, giving the two some privacy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Amelia left, Chloe naturally took a seat opposite Alexander, simply sitting cross-legged on the carpet without regard for decorum.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Alexander Evans, let's not beat around the bush," she said directly. "I'm not a friend of your mother's, I'm a pediatric psychologist."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander had already realized she wasn't just a friend of Amelia. Her disclosure didn't change his expression, and his eyes remained fixed on the model in his hands.</span></p></div>
