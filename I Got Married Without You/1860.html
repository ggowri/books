        <h1>Chapter 1860: Master Davies Doesn't Mind</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carson stood by the window, phone in hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a moment of hesitation, he dialed James's number.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just a heads up, Matty's sending me to the front. I'll be fighting against you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James didn't seem surprised by Matty's tactics. His expression didn't change much.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You could just switch sides and watch the show from the sidelines."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A carefree smile played on Carson's lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm 1-4, the first puppeteer to join Erebus. There's no way I'd just stand by and watch, at most I won't go after you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were many brothers in Erebus, besides Matty. For their sake, for the Erebus they built together, he had to follow orders, complete the mission.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I won't attack you, but S's people have killed my family. I might have to take a few of them down."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The word 'kid' filled James with a strange sense of warmth, as if he had found a loving elder in that moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"See you tomorrow."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Given the circumstances, Carson wouldn't defect easily. James knew better than to try and convince him. After saying those three words, he added two more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Uncle."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James had called him 'uncle' before, but this time it felt different. It felt like he was actually family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carson wanted to say something, but James hung up. As he stared at the screen, the bedroom door swung open. Johnny stood </span><span>there,</span><span> arms crossed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Uncle, you're 1-4, aren't you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caught red-handed, Carson was shocked, but he didn't show it. He brushed past Johnny and left the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You knew I wanted to go to Erebus, you gave me a golden leaf and a stupid codename to mock me. But when I was in danger, you reached out to help."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ignoring Johnny, Carson opened a bottle of wine and filled a glass to the brim. Just as he was about to drink, Johnny's hand covered the glass.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Uncle, since you're a partner in Erebus, Herb and I never got an invitation. You're afraid we'd go and never come back, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carson, unable to find an excuse or hide the truth, looked at Johnny.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Without me, you would have died in Erebus. Do you think I'd have golden leaves sent to you two idiots?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Johnny hated Carson's mouth, but had to admit he was right. Without him, he would indeed be dead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I just didn</span><span>'</span><span>t expect you to be the puppet master behind Erebus, or that Amelia</span><span>'</span><span>s grandfather would be its founder."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mentioning Amelia made Johnny nervous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I just heard you say Amelia is trapped in Erebus. Is she in danger?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carson looked thoughtful as he observed the anxious Johnny.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why do you seem more worried about Amelia than James?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Johnny, feeling exposed, avoided Carson</span><span>'</span><span>s gaze and loosened his grip on the wine glass.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course not."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Really?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carson sipped his wine, studying Johnny.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you weren't, you wouldn't have risked your life to save Amelia."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Johnny looked uncomfortable, unwilling to admit his past actions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I would extend a helping hand to any woman or child in danger."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carson didn</span><span>'</span><span>t press further, just sipped his wine, thinking about tomorrow's events.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I heard you on the phone with James. Are you two planning a fight to the death tomorrow?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hardly a death match. I'm just buying time. Once I've done that, I'll pull out."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wasn't foolish enough to send his men to their deaths.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll go with you tomorrow."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carson, who was drinking his wine, looked surprised.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What can you do?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The kid who was always sick, who couldn't fight or carry a load, was going to be a sentry?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Johnny saw the contempt in his uncle's eyes and his face darkened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If I didn't know, I wouldn't go. But now that I do know, I have to help James."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carson thought Johnny was crazy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm helping Erebus, you're helping James, and you want to go with me? Are you kidding?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can't just stand by and do nothing."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Johnny left after dropping that line.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let me know before you leave tomorrow. I'll inform my men."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carson almost had a heart attack. Not helping him, but helping James, and still </span><span>reminding him to call. He had never seen such a turncoat!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Also, Johnny was helping James for Amelia, wasn't he? Why does this kid always get himself into troubling situations?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carson was left scratching his head, while James, having sent the S members to the Cloud territory, waited for Andrew.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Along with Andrew, Master Davies, who had never shown his face, stepped in. "James, your men traced their investigations to me. Impressive."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James, standing by the floor-to-ceiling window, turned slightly and looked at Master Davies. "If I can't find your people, this is the only way to invite you over. I hope you don</span><span>'</span><span>t mind, Master Davies?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Master Davies, leaning on his cane, took off his black hat and slowly walked in. "Even if you hadn't investigated darkness, I would have come to see you anyway. </span><span>Of course</span><span> I don't mind."</span></p></div>
