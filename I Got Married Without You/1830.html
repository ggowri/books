        <h1>Chapter 1830 The first condition</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matty ignored James' question and continued to present his conditions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"After you meet her, you cannot tell Amelia that Erebus restricts your personal freedom, nor can you tell her about the chip in your brain. You must also act as if nothing has happened, maintaining your undercover identity as 2-9, and not disclose the forced divorce and our knowledge of your identity."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James, after a moment of contemplation, suddenly realized something from Matty's words. His eyes, filled with frost, slowly lifted to meet the black mask. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you related to Amelia? Only such a relationship would make 1-1 fear that Amelia would know about the ordeal you have suffered in Erebus."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James' sharp insight caused Matty's fingers, resting on his thigh, to tremble subconsciously. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Since you have guessed, I won't hide it from you. I saw Amelia on the surveillance and found her resemblance to my wife. I conducted a DNA test, and the results showed that she is my granddaughter."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon realizing this, James' eyes dimmed. "You want me to keep it from her because you fear she will turn against you due to the chip in my brain?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You are very clever," Matty praised James without hesitation. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James, in turn, smirked coldly. "You finally found her, and yet you are so cruel to her. You should cherish her, shouldn't you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matty did not comment on James' words, but he extended his hand, wearing protective gloves, and pointed at James' head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The chip in your brain is a time bomb. You never know when it will infect and kill you. If Amelia finds out that you died because of this, she will never forgive me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James' heart sank. He had a brain tumor and had the chip installed. Even if it were </span><span>removed, the toxins left in his brain would spread upon surgery. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was willing to bear the burden of a short life alone, rather than let Amelia suffer from his impending death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matty, looking at the man who had not stood up from the beginning, exuded an oppressive aura even while seated. "You can refuse, but you will never see Amelia again."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James, upon hearing this, smirked with a hint of mockery. "If I am not mistaken, she has discovered your identity and knows that you are the founder of Erebus. Unable to hide it, you can only agree to let her meet me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matty, who had rushed to see him in the middle of the night and presented these conditions, was undoubtedly trying to silence him after Amelia discovered his identity. James saw through Matty's intentions, causing Matty to feel a bit annoyed but also impressed by James' perceptiveness. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matty was not in a rush, as he knew that James would eventually agree to his conditions due to his longing for Amelia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It is true that Amelia discovered my identity, which is why I came to negotiate with you. You should be clear about the purpose of my negotiation, right?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James' indifferent gaze passed over the black-clad figure in front of him and rested on the glass chambers lined up in the biochemistry area.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You will not let go of your hatred for S, and I also seek revenge for the members. The conflict between us will not cease, so you do not want me to be with her."</span></p></div>
