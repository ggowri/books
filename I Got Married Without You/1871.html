        <h1>Chapter 1871 Revenge for Zack</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James's footsteps came to a slow halt as he intended to confront Matty directly in the biohazard area for negotiations. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, he did not expect to find one of the manipulated individuals who had previously tampered with the </span><span>seventh round</span><span> game hiding there. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, James's cold, snow-like eyes locked onto the person's head. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After the person's skull was opened, James realized that someone had intentionally manipulated the </span><span>seventh round</span><span> game. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zack, who could have survived, was sacrificed to test him. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James was determined to personally avenge this blood feud. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With his gloved hand, James holstered his firearm and slowly pulled out a golden knife. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a swift motion, he charged towards the manipulated individual designated as 1-9 in Sector B. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caught off guard, 1-9 didn't even have time to recognize the approaching man before his throat was swiftly slit. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clutching his bleeding throat, 1-9 stared with eyes filled with unwillingness, fixated on James, who had already sheathed his knife. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At first, 1-9 couldn't understand why James only killed him, but in his final moments, he realized it was because he had killed Zack. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After 1-9 fell, James calmly crouched down, and Johnny, who had followed him into the biohazard area, mistakenly thought James was going to strike again. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, James simply used the clothes of the deceased to wipe the blood off his knife. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Johnny rolled his eyes in disbelief and then raised his gun, shooting and killing the person who attempted to shoot James. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I saved your life. How do you plan to thank me?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James, still calmly wiping the blood off his knife, heard Johnny's voice but didn't bother to look up, lightly parting his lips. "If you don't mind, once I rescue your sister-in-law, let's have a meal together as a couple." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I shouldn't have saved you!" Johnny gritted his teeth, holstered his gun, and angrily retreated with his men. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, halfway through the retreat, he stopped. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia hadn't been rescued </span><span>yet,</span><span> how could he just leave like this? </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that thought in mind, Johnny suppressed his anger and returned to the battlefield. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Holden and Emelyn, who had finished off the last manipulated individuals, quickly arrived in the biohazard area to join James. "Mr. Shawn, all 49 manipulated individuals have been eliminated." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James slowly stood up, sheathing his golden knife. "What about the others?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We have them locked up."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After putting away his knife, James raised his cold and solemn gaze, looking towards the remaining surveillance in the biohazard area. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Matty, release Amelia, and I will release your people." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matty, who had just reached the escape room, slowed his pace upon hearing the conversation through the surveillance. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Through the thick glass window, Matty looked at Amelia sitting on the bed, hugging her knees. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As his gaze fell upon her face, which bore a striking resemblance to Sophia's, Matty's expression gradually became complex. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, this complexity only lasted for a moment before he immediately composed himself, changed his direction, and walked towards the control panel outside the escape room. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He pressed the button for the upper area's broadcast and responded to James. "The conditions are not enough." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matty, who no longer valued the lives of the other manipulated individuals, only wanted to know who the founder of S was. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What if I add the founder of S? Will that be enough?"</span></p></div>
