        <h1>Chapter 1837: Unbelievable</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James's almond eyes, deep and unreadable, sat under his furrowed brows.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia tried to unravel their secrets, but they remained elusive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her heart was heavy, especially after her transplant, as it seemed more sensitive to emotional shocks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After enduring so much, Amelia felt stronger. She kept her cool, despite the pain, as she faced James. "Why don't you return home or contact me?" she asked him, seeking an honest answer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James, always brooding, finally replied, "I don't want to go home, and I... don't want to contact you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words cut through Amelia, making it difficult to breathe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is it because of Emily?" she asked, looking at the face she missed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes," James replied, a small smile softening his features.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The answer was a blow to Amelia's heart, but she held her gaze, staring into James's laughing eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"James, you've used Emily to hurt me thrice - post our agreement, during our forced divorce, and now. It's painful but... I don't buy that she's why you avoid home or me. If you loved Emily, it would've happened ages ago. Where would I be then?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia grabbed James's fist, feeling its coldness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She looked at his hand. Once, he would hold hers back, now it just trembled, as cold as their divorce day.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hiding her sorrow, she enveloped his hand with hers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"James," she said, "my hardships - my family, my childhood - were due to Emily and her dad. They've been cruel, with no family-like warmth. I hate them. So, stop using Emily to provoke me. It's as if you're teaming with them to torment me, and it hurts."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia's past outbursts were due to this pain. She'd contemplated abandoning James.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But, facing death again, she realized she loved him. Despite her fury, she was glad he hadn't used Emily to hurt her this time. Otherwise, she might've lost control and left abruptly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm sorry," James said, clasping Amelia's hand, his touch a lifeline.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even with the countdown ticking, he met her loving gaze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I won't upset you with Emily again," he said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia's heart softened at his words, and she squeezed his hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I know you're not away because of her. Matty must be holding you captive," she said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Amelia, I'm not captive," he smiled softly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Surprised at his denial, Amelia still managed a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, you just don't want to come home or contact me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James nodded, his eyes darkening, the countdown now steady.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without Emily to stir emotions, Amelia was more logical.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"James, you could've reached out to Andrew or Paul, but you didn't. That proves you're not free," she reasoned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If James was truly free, he could've left Erebus, messaged S, and informed his family. But he hadn't. Not even a word to Holden or Emelyn. Wasn't that proof he was trapped?</span></p></div>
