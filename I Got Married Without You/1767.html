        <h1>Chapter 1767 James tore up the divorce papers</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After standing still for a few seconds, James numbly tore up the divorce agreement and suppressed all his emotions. He turned to Emily and said, "I've cooperated with your act, hurt her, and made her sign the divorce agreement. Now, open the access to the Erebus exit."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emily, who had been watching the show, saw him tear up the divorce agreement and didn't stop him. She had already achieved her goal of making Amelia feel abandoned and making James suffer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Emily thought about this, she released her hands from her chest and patted James on the chest. But before her fingertips could touch him, he avoided her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emily's hand froze for two seconds, then she casually rubbed her fingertips and said, "When she entered the room, Ben had already opened it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James coldly glanced at Emily, then quickly walked to the console. He shattered the screen and slowly moved the green indicator key towards the Erebus exit. He stared at the key until it showed that the Erebus door had opened and the player had safely left. Then, the coldness in his eyes turned into a deadly aura.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked at the shattered glass beside him, and without hesitation, he picked up a piece and quickly returned to the </span><span>ninth round</span><span> game room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emily sat on the console, playing with her hair and tilting her head, smiling at him. "Although this console can't modify the program, the map displayed on the screen is real. So, I've kept my promise to you. There's no need to kill me, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emily had already expected James to betray her, and she wasn't surprised or afraid of him. She lazily leaned on the console, watching him approach with the shard in his hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man didn't hesitate. He aimed at her neck, and suddenly, an explosive pain surged in his brain. But before the pain could make him pass out, he gritted his teeth and slashed at her neck. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emily felt a chill on her neck as a cut opened, and fresh blood gushed out. If Mr. Ben hadn't acted quickly, pressing the level-ten pain button, the shard would have severely </span><span>cut her throat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Touching her neck and seeing the blood on her fingertips, she flew into a rage. Like a madwoman, she kicked the already unconscious James.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing her injured, Mr. Ben immediately shut down the surveillance of the </span><span>ninth round</span><span> game room, left the control room, and entered the lower area. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There, he found Emily crouched on the ground, gently caressing the fallen James.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Witnessing this scene, Mr. Ben halted, then walked up to Emily with the chip controller in hand. He lowered his gaze to her face, marked with a cross-shaped cut. "You've achieved your revenge on him and his wife. When will you activate the chip detonation button?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emily's fingers, resting on James's leg, stiffened for a moment. Then, she released her grip and looked at the controller in Mr. Ben's hand. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A gentle press, and the man who had tried to kill her countless times would be dead. However, as she stared at the handsome face of James, engraved in her mind for so many years, she suddenly felt reluctant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I haven't had enough revenge yet. First, lock him up in solitary confinement, then slowly torment him until he dies," she said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mr. Ben, waiting for the detonation button press, heard this and disappointment filled his eyes. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had promised him that once she had tortured James enough, she would kill him. Why did she suddenly become soft-hearted again?</span></p></div>
