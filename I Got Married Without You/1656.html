        <h1>Chapter 1656 Only 30% of her love</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Kate saw the bloodstains on Paul's socks at the hotel, she was startled and immediately called for a doctor. Paul, who showed no reaction no matter how the doctor treated him, curled up on the couch, closed his eyes, and sulked alone. Seeing her son in such a state, Kate naturally felt heartbroken. She sat down beside him and tried to comfort him in a gentle voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Paul, if she doesn't want to marry you, just let it go. Don't ruin your health over a woman like her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul didn't want to listen. He turned away, facing the couch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at his tall figure from behind, Kate sighed heavily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If she loved you, she wouldn't have hurt you so recklessly."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul got a little angry and clenched his fists.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What do you know?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva did love him, just not as much. Maybe only 30% of her love, which was why she didn't hesitate to hurt him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I may not understand, but if it were me, I would never go back to Eva."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul felt a bit wronged and reached for a pillow, hugging it tightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom, I don't want to go back to her either, but I love her so much and can't let go."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since he became aware of his love for Eva, he couldn't control his emotions anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He missed the old Eva, who would forgive him no matter what he did wrong or said if he begged her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He also missed when she used to curl up in his arms like a little kitten, asking him if he had feelings for her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He missed that Eva and wanted her back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he had been begging her for two years, and she still didn't want to come back...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul's nose tingled, and he instinctively covered his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Two years ago, when she asked for a breakup, I shouldn't have agreed."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he hadn't agreed, that Eva from back then would never have left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing the choked voice, Kate's heart sank subconsciously. Did he love Eva this much?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul didn't give an answer, but his actions showed her that he loved Eva to the extreme.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Paul lying in the hotel, refusing to go back to the country and refusing to eat, Kate also felt sad.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Paul, it's pointless for you to act like this. You can't win Ms. Miller back, so why torture yourself?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was causing a scene here, but she couldn't see it. Why torment himself?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul ignored her, looking outside when his eyes were open and sleeping when they were closed, like a walking corpse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at Paul, who couldn't eat or drink, Kate's heart grew even more resentful towards Eva.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But deep down, her subconscious told her that it was because of her interference that Paul and Eva ended up like this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it weren't for her, Paul might have already married smoothly, so why would he lie in </span><span>a foreign country waiting to die?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feeling increasingly guilty, Kate asked the bodyguard to watch over Paul and went to the hospital to find Eva with her bag.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Coincidentally, Eva had just come out of the ward when she met Kate. She originally wanted to avoid her, but Kate directly stopped her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Miller, would you have time to have a cup of coffee?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Compared to their first meeting, Kate was much more polite this time, but Eva still refused.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I need to buy a wheelchair. I don't have time."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kate took a step forward and blocked her way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's just a few words. You don't have to resist so much."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva stopped and raised her cold gaze, looking at the wealthy woman in front of her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mrs. Evans, I rejected your son. You should take this opportunity to cut off his feelings instead of coming to chat with me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Compared to their first meeting when she was humble, Eva was more sharp-tongued this time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She really didn't want to marry Paul, so she no longer pretended to be polite. Was she still playing hard to get?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kate had reservations about this, but her heart leaned more towards the former.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Miller, my initial intention was for you to reject my son, not to ruin his life."</span></p></div>
