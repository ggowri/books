        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Can't talk </span><span>'cause</span><span> of cameras?" Amelia asked, hinting at Matty to turn them off. But James pulled her back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No cameras in Matty's private room, Amelia."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The only camera-free space in Ace. Matty kept it pry-free.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Soundproof? Afraid he might overhear..." she glanced at the metallic surroundings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James smirked at her paranoia. "It's soundproof. And he doesn't know me, why eavesdrop?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia thought Matty knew James from Emily, hence the restrictions. But James denied it, comforting her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If he knew me, would I be safe here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Amelia, I'm hiding from Emily who's using my identity. She's keeping me in Erebus, cut off from everyone. I'm trying to find Erebus' creator to return to you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said this to clear Amelia's doubts so they could part in peace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James knew hints or guesses wouldn't help. Matty needed them apart, or he'd be trapped and their unborn child would be at risk.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His safety wasn't important, but the child Amelia fought to conceive was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sight of James threatened by Emily saddened Amelia. She hugged him tight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"James, knowing Erebus' founder, you can leave. I'll deal with Emily."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she leaned into him, melting into his arms, James felt his icy heart thaw. He held her tighter, unable to resist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She tried to protect him, but he felt guilty. He was pushing her away in his way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Amelia."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her eyes sparkled with joy; she was glad he called her by her name again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gazing at Amelia, James struggled to say the harsh truth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, he had to change the situation. Even if it hurt, he had to be cruel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I know Erebus' founder now, I'll find a way out, don't worry."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Mmm</span><span>."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia hugged James tighter, relieved that he was okay.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There's something else I need to tell you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this, Amelia looked up at him, her eyes twinkling with anticipation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Go ahead."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The divorce papers from before... they're legit," he steeled himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?" her smile faded to a sad grimace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His heart raced and fear of losing her gripped him. He hugged her tighter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She stared, then pushed him off, meeting his gaze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Explain."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His heart sank as she pushed him away, the finality of it all ringing in his ears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once the words were said, they couldn't be unsaid. He was left with the pain, watching her from afar, divided by a sea of hurdles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We're officially divorced."</span></p></div>
