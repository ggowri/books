        <h1>Chapter 1841: Talk to the Baby</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Amelia."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Amelia was about to walk away, James suddenly called out to her. She turned around and found him staring at her belly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Can I... touch the baby?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hadn't been around since she got pregnant and hadn't had the chance to feel the baby.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Following his gaze, Amelia looked down at her protruding belly and gave a slight nod of approval.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James then reached out and touched her belly, feeling the roundness beneath his fingers. His heart, which felt like it was tearing apart, instantly softened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing the softness in James' eyes, Amelia was reminded of Paul reading a children's book to the baby in Eva's belly. She wanted the baby's father to have a chance to talk to the baby too, so she asked James.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you... want to talk to the baby?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caught off guard, James didn't know what to say but he cherished the moment, gently touched Amelia's belly, and softly said, "Hello..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a moment, he looked up at Amelia with a nervous expression, "Can he hear me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia gently caressed her belly and nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He's almost six months old now. He moves around a lot, so sometimes when I talk, he responds by moving his arms and legs."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James, who was about to become a father for the first time, had never heard about these things before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing that their baby was moving around in her belly made his eyes well up with tears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But why... why isn't he moving now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had been touching carefully, but he couldn't feel the baby moving as Amelia had described.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Maybe... you didn't say enough."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just saying hello wasn't enough. Their baby wasn't familiar with his voice yet and probably couldn't be bothered to respond.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James stared at the growing belly, lost in thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rising from his chair, he knelt in front of her, his gaze level with the unseen life within.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He spoke again, sincerity ringing in his voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your mother has gone through a lot to have you. We just hope you'll be born safe and healthy." He continued, "As your father, I feel guilty for not being there for you, for not telling you stories or taking care of your mother."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But kid, I don't ask for much in life. If your mother is okay and you're born safe, I can handle everything else."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At his words, the baby inside responded with a movement. Amelia's belly stirred.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He moved," she said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James placed his ear against her belly, feeling the tiny movements intimately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Three kicks, each one clear and powerful, as if the baby was reaching out to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Overwhelmed with emotion, James let out a silent cry. He held her tighter, hiding his tears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia couldn't see his face, but she let him hold her until the baby's movement ceased.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, James slowly recomposed himself, gently releasing her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Take care of yourself," he said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia nodded and they shared a silent moment before she broke it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I... I'll go first," she said, turning quickly and leaving the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James watched her go, a bitter smile on his face, the pain of separation etching onto his heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the door closed behind her, he mocked himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The weak deserve the pain, so why fear it when you've already pushed it away?</span></p></div>
