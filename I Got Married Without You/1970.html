        <h1>Chapter 1970 IQ Isn't as High as His</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia decided to give James some space to work. Just then, she received a call from Eva, who was looking for someone to chat with. Amelia immediately invited her over for coffee.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva arrived with her two children and headed straight for the backyard of Blue Bay Island. From afar, she spotted Amelia sitting under a parasol, sipping coffee while working on her design blueprints.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite having given birth, Amelia still maintained her slim and toned figure. She also took great care of her skin, and from behind, she looked no different from a young woman in her twenties.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva's heart fluttered like a gentle autumn breeze as she saw Amelia, who had always been beautiful. "Amelia, where's the little genius? Call him out, let my kids pay their respects."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia turned around with a smile upon hearing Eva's voice, her gaze shifting from Eva's bright face to the two little ones.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The boy, dressed in a white shirt and a plaid waistcoat, had his hair slicked back, revealing a clean, smooth face. His appearance and attire were a spitting image of Paul, albeit in a smaller version.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The girl, on the other hand, was dressed in a sparkly princess gown, her hair tied up in a bun with a silver crown perched atop her head. She looked like a princess straight out of a fairytale, absolutely adorable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Compared to her own son's unchanging grumpy face, Amelia was smitten with Eva's children. She put down her blueprints, got up, and opened her arms wide.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Maxwell, Margot, come here, give me a hug!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Amelia, the two children happily broke free from Eva's grasp and ran towards her. Especially Maxwell, who seemed to have the wind in his sails as he plunged into Amelia's arms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Amelia," Maxwell said, pulling out his new toy car and showing it off to Amelia. "My daddy bought this new one for me, and my sister doesn't even have one. Look, isn't it cool?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia held the boy tightly and smiled, patting his head. "Wow! Your daddy bought you a new toy! It's definitely cool."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was about to brag about how his toy car could transform when Margot caught up with him. "Amelia, my daddy got me a doll too. It's just too big to bring over, but it's way cooler than my brother's toy car. Make sure you come over sometime, I'll show you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia nodded with a smile, agreed, and then hugged Margot, planting a kiss on her chubby cheek. "Margot's getting chubbier, so cute!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Margot, thrilled by the kiss, cupped Amelia's face and pecked at her rosy lips. "Amelia's getting prettier, I like that."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These two kids could practically heal the world with their charm. Amelia was so fond of them that she couldn't bear to let them go. But their playful nature soon had them distracted by a bubble machine brought by the servants...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Watching the kids chase bubbles across the lawn, Amelia felt a pang of envy. "Sometimes I'm so envy of you, having such carefree, joyful kids..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva, now seated and sipping her coffee, responded, "You're envious of me? I'm envious of you having a genius son! Especially Paul, he was so jealous when he heard Alexander has an IQ of 150, he was pounding the ground at the cemetery."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia turned back to Eva. "It's been half a year. Why is Paul still hanging around the cemetery every day?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva sighed deeply, "After marrying me, Paul focused on his family, even less on visiting Anthony in the Imperial Capital. He didn't even know Anthony had stomach cancer until he passed away because he was having a conference abroad. He didn't even say the last goodbye to his best friend. The guilt is eating him up."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For the past six months, whenever Paul had a chance, he'd sit by Anthony's grave with a bottle of liquor, occasionally toasting to the tombstone. At first, he'd get so drunk he'd cry out loud. It scared the cemetery caretaker into calling Eva about Paul's mental state.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thankfully, time healed all wounds. With Eva and the kids by his side, Paul slowly accepted the reality of his friend's death. Though he still visited often, watched by the caretaker to keep him from drinking recklessly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia understood Paul's grief and encouraged Eva to show him extra care and prevent him from sinking too deeply into sorrow. Eva nodded and then returned to the original topic. "You mentioned on the phone that you were troubled about Alexander's upbringing. He is already a genius, what more could you be worried about?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia relayed what Chloe had told her. "Dr. MacAdam said Alexander is very smart but too arrogant. She advised me to guide him on the right path, but that's a challenge for me. My IQ isn't as high as his. If I try to lead, he might not listen to me..."</span></p></div>
