        <h1>Chapter 1689 Ryan as Edith’s guinea pig</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James nodded and lowered his head to kiss Amelia's hair. "I'm sorry for worrying you," he said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia lifted her head from his embrace and looked up at the man with a well-defined jawline. "I just saw Emily. Is there something you need to talk to her about?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James tensed up, surprised that she had seen Emily. After hesitating for a moment, he spoke softly, "She has a list of S members. I want to deal with her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He actually intended to kill her, but he failed. Everyone around Emily was part of Erebus, and if he went after her as James, they would suspect him. Fortunately, before he rushed out, he saw the identification badge on the other person and canceled his plan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he still had a question. Why didn't Emily or Mr. Ben tell Erebus about his identity? Or perhaps Erebus already knew and was just leading him into a trap. After all, Erebus was formed to take down the leader of S. Since they already knew who the leader was, why didn't they capture him?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia quickly believed him. "Did you get the list back?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James shook his head gently. "There's a person named Mr. Ben with her. He </span><span>memorized the list. Unless Mr. Ben dies, I won't be able to get it back."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia wanted to ask who Mr. Ben was, but James had a serious expression, as if he had encountered something difficult.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At times like this, Amelia didn't want to bother him. After a moment of contemplation, James bent down slightly and lifted her up in his arms. "I'll take care of my business. Don't worry. Let's go to Paul's wedding."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James always brought peace to Amelia, never any worries. Even though he had a heavy heart now, he didn't want her to worry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Understanding his intentions, Amelia reached out and wrapped her arms around his neck. She obediently replied, "Okay."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her gentleness had always been a soothing balm for James' soul. Just a simple word from her could sweep away his troubles and make him fearlessly move forward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ryan, who had witnessed this scene, lowered his eyelashes slowly, hiding his endless desolation. Edith, who had been observing him from afar, casually took a glass of champagne from a waiter and walked over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop staring and have a drink to lighten up."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Edith interrupted Ryan's thoughts with the glass of champagne she handed him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He glanced at the champagne and a hint of coldness appeared in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do I need to remind you about not drinking during the recovery period? Should I, as a patient, remind you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew the dietary restrictions himself, but it wasn't a big deal. The problem was that when he was undergoing rehabilitation, she would read books and treat him at the same time, treating him like a guinea pig.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ryan wanted to dismiss her, but Edith said something that made him agree to let her stay for another month. If she couldn't cure him by then, she would leave. After all, she was hired by Amelia. Ryan reluctantly nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It hadn't been a month yet, but Ryan was already hoping for her experiment to fail so that she would leave quickly. Otherwise, if she stayed by his side, not only would he not be able to stand up, his good gastrointestinal condition might also be ruined by her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Edith glanced at Ryan and awkwardly smiled. "Oh, come on. A little drink won't hurt."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ryan ignored her and asked Zoey to push him further away. Edith followed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You really won't drink?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ryan, who usually avoided crowds, hid among the people to prevent Edith from finding him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Watching his figure hidden in the crowd, Edith raised her champagne glass and drank it herself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ryan suffered from depression, and Edith deliberately took this treatment approach, which actually made it easier for him to emerge from the abyss. But Ryan didn't understand. However, Edith didn't care about the patient's misconceptions about her. As long as the final result was good, it was enough.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From a distance, Anthony watched Edith drinking alone. He hesitated, raised his foot, and then put it back down. In the end, he just watched Edith, who even refused him in </span><span>his dreams, from a distance...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kate came out of the banquet hall and saw Anthony looking at Edith with a longing but hesitant expression. It made Kate feel a little sorry for him. After hesitating for a moment, she walked towards Anthony. "Mr. Clark, why don't you go say hello to Edith?"</span></p></div>
