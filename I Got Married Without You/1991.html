        <h1>Chapter 1991 His Most Regretful Thing</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The fallen tree on the snowy mountain was like a rotten log separating life and death. James wanted to step over it, but for some reason, he slowly sat down on the dead log.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander, who was following behind, saw his father sitting down, he quickly walked over with an umbrella.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The umbrella blocked the falling snow. James' long eyelashes trembled slightly, but he did not look back. He just stretched out his broad palm and gently patted the dead log.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sit down."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was afraid that his father would get wet in the snow, so he sat down next to James without taking away the umbrella. He just bent his knees and supported his elbows on his thighs, with the edge of the umbrella tilted to his father's side.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James today was different from before. He was wearing a black coat and a white scarf. He was still dressed the same as before, but his carefully groomed face revealed a hint of farewell.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Father."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander called out, but he didn't know what to say. It seemed like they had already said everything, and there seemed to be nothing more to say. But if he said nothing, he would always feel regretful...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James turned his eyes slightly and looked at Alexander who was only wearing a light suit, then took off his coat and wrapped it around him naturally. Alexander refused and wanted to give it back, but was held down by a strong hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, this is all I can do for you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was this feeling of alienation that made Alexander not know what to say or how to express what he thought. He could only tighten the clothes that still had the residual warmth of his father, and wrap himself in such protection like a child.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two of them looked at the endless snow. After a long silence, Alexander's cold and reluctant voice quietly sounded in James' ears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Father, there is still a lot you can do for me. Believe me, I can take out the chip."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James, dressed in a black suit, looked like a king. He supported his knee with one hand, looking at the white snow falling outside the umbrella, and smiled slightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You've been researching for three years. Of course I believe that you can remove the chip."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander looked at James in surprise. "Father, you...know my medical studies?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The omnipotent man raised his thick eyebrows slightly. "When you were little, you pretended to be sick to disturb me and your mother, and she took advantage of the situation. I knew it all."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What he meant was that as a husband and a father, he had always known about their secret. It was just he had never interfered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at such an open-minded father, Alexander's eyes were slightly hot, but he controlled the urge to cry and promised with a smile, "Father, please wait a little longer. I will definitely succeed."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James raised his cold fingers, placed them on Alexander's shoulders and pressed hard. "If I could go back to twenty years ago and someone asked me to wait a little longer, I would definitely wait."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He waited for so many years before finally having Alexander, which was a blessing but also a pity. Because waiting too long would easily miss it. Sometimes, even if one made all kinds of preparations, it was still too late.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander lowered his eyebrows and remained silent for a long time. Then he raised his determined eyes and looked at James steadily. "Father, give me another two months, I can do it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing his son who was unwilling to bow to fate, James nodded with relief. "Try your best and don't work too hard."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander shook his head and said firmly again, "Father, you taught me that I should devote every effort to everything I do, instead of just trying my best."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James smiled and said no more, he just patted his shoulder. Then he withdrew his hand and looked away, gazing at the snow-covered forest below the snow-capped mountains.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander followed his gaze and looked towards the vast forest. "Father, you never told me how you met Mom. Sometimes, I really want to know."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In James' mind, a bright figure suddenly appeared, as well as the figure of begging strangers for help in the heavy rain. His eyes, which seemed to be exhausted, gradually lit up. "It is also an unspeakable past."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He slowly recounted the past in a calm voice. What Alexander heard was not the hardships they had gone through, but his father's reluctance and attachment to his mother when he was about to die.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's heart sank, but he subconsciously asked, "Father, what is the most regretful thing in your life?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James turned his eyes and stared at Alexander quietly. "When I was in my twenties, I spent all my energy and time on fighting for power and profit. I was too focused on fighting with Gloria, which caused your mom to be out of the light for five years. Now think about it, if I was stronger at that time, maybe I could marry her earlier, and I wouldn't have wasted eight years."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander wanted to comfort him, saying that as long as the ending was good. But James looked at the snow and said, "Also, I promised her that I would be with her forever... But God has found me guilty and made me give a promise that I can't keep in this life. It is a regret and also a punishment."</span></p></div>
