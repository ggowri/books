        <h1>Chapter 1875 Where is Master Davies</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James nodded slightly. Bernard was just an uncultured street </span><span>thug,</span><span> how could he compete with the powerful Matty? </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if Bernard united many thugs and formed Darkness, it would still take a long time to gather enough power to kill him. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But Bernard was killed by Darkness' second-in-command before he had a chance to seek revenge." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matty understood, but he didn't realize that he had been living in Bernard's plan all along. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bernard had killed Zelene early on, so Matty wouldn't suspect a stranger's death. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He then manipulated all the evidence of Sophia's betrayal and directed it towards the Wilson family's other enemies. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, using Matty's time spent investigating, Bernard expanded the Darkness organization and used its power to seek revenge. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a good plan, but unfortunately, Bernard's life was cut short by his own friend. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matty felt some relief thinking about Bernard's fate. But what about himself?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was involved in all of this. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No, he caused all of this. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he hadn't killed Daley, Zelene wouldn't have had the opportunity to frame him, and Bernard wouldn't have taken his anger out on Sophia, let alone in that way. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matty found it difficult to accept and took a step back. If it weren't for the console supporting him, his old body would have collapsed. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's impossible!" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matty still refused to believe that Sophia's death was because of him. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If that were true, then what face did he have to continue living? </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you hadn't killed Daley, how could you have killed Sophia?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In Matty's cold-blooded heart for decades, guilt suddenly filled him. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Daley tried to kill me first, that's why I..." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it weren't for Daley almost killing him with that shot, Matty wouldn't have killed him in return. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia, who had been silently listening, interjected when she heard this. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you hadn't interfered between Sophia and Daley, why would Daley want to kill you?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matty raised his bloodshot eyes and looked at the woman standing behind the bulletproof glass. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her serene and beautiful face was almost identical to Sophia's when she was young. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at that face, Matty thought of his first encounter with Sophia, when he fell in love at first sight. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"When I fell for Sophia, Daley was just her childhood friend..." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matty's eyes, now wrinkled with age, filled with tears. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It was Daley who noticed my interest in Sophia and confessed to her first..." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"By the time I knew what love was, Daley had already taken the lead..." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matty choked up, feeling aggrieved. "I was just one step too late." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was one step too late, missing out on Sophia's first love. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was one step too late, causing misunderstandings between them. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matty thought about all the grievances and pain caused by these events, and trembled with the inability to accept them. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He suppressed his guilt, discomfort, regret, and longing, and slowly shifted his gaze to James across from him. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What would you do if you were in my place?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In matters of the heart, they should be the same kind of person. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But James didn't respond, he just looked at him indifferently. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because for the former James, besides taking Amelia away, there was also the desire to make her happy. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm not at fault." James didn't answer, Matty answered for himself, affirming that he wasn't at fault. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wiped away the tears in his eyes and stared at Amelia with determination and unwavering strength. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It was Daley's jealousy that drove him to snatch Sophia away from me!" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If it weren't for him, I wouldn't have let Sophia follow him, I would have fought to get her back!" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia looked at Matty, who suddenly learned the truth and became frantic, and for a moment, she didn't know whether to feel pity or resentment. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Like James, she fell into silence and watched as Matty spoke to himself, denying any wrongdoing and regaining composure. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who told you all of this?" Finally getting to the point, James gradually regained his composure. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The founder of the S organization." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who is he?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James glanced at Matty with indifference, his voice cold and devoid of warmth. "He is </span><span>Zelene's nephew, Master Davies." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Master Davies... </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matty's face became serious, and James' voice, devoid of any warmth, echoed in his ears. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Master Davies' father was also involved in Sophia&rsquo;s death." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Where is he?"</span></p></div>
