        <h1>Chapter 1188 James, Are you lost your mind?</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No wonder Gloria looked at him with hatred when she beat him. It turned out that there was a grudge between them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His father ignored him because he thought the child born to the Clark family was stillborn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His grandfather stood by and did nothing because half of his bloodline came from the Clark family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James's body stiffened and gradually cooled, even his blood was cold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Dominic hadn't told him about the past, he might have been indifferent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, he raised his incredulous eyes and looked at Dominic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What is my biological mother's name?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After two seconds of silence, Dominic spoke coldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ashley."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Master Davies' muse was also named Ashley.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Master raised him, took care of him, and treated him better than his own son because he was Ashley's child.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, James understood everything he couldn't figure out over the years, but...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he is Ashley's child, then he and Amelia are... cousins?!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James couldn't accept it and fell on the sofa. His expression was as if he had lost his soul and spirit, and he turned pale in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing that he seemed to have figured it out, Dominic reached out and patted his shoulder. "This is why I didn't let you be together."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James was like an ice sculpture, with no reaction. Seeing him like this, Dominic sighed heavily again. "You are cousins, you can't be together. Quickly divorce her and send her away, otherwise Carol will really expose this matter, and you will be finished!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man sitting on the couch remained silent for several seconds before shaking his head. "I won't divorce her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dominic didn't expect him to be so stubborn and became angry, his face turning red. "James, you're her cousin, how can you be together?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James's eyes were filled with determination that had never been seen before. "Even if she were my biological sister, I would still be with her!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They didn't understand. He had loved Amelia for 11 years, and his love for her was ingrained in his bones. How could he separate from her?!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dominic was shocked by this bold statement and was stunned for a long time before reacting. "James, you're ignoring the laws of nature. Are you crazy?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James's lips curled into a sneer, revealing his white teeth. " I've been crazy for a long time. When I thought she was dead, I was already crazy. So..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man on the couch slowly raised his fierce, bloodthirsty eyes, like a demon crawling out of hell, with a pair of dark red eyes fixed on Dominic. "Don't force me to divorce her again, or I'll go crazy. I'll be even more uncontrollable than my father!"</span></p></div>
