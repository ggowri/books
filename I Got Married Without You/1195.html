        <h1>Chapter 1195 Go and see if that “mother” of mine is dead yet?</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's okay, I understand."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She stepped forward and straightened his disheveled clothes. "You haven't slept all night. Take a nap while it's still early."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She spoke in a gentle and soothing voice, and James quickly became immersed in her tenderness. Even his restless and anxious mind gradually calmed down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia didn't even ask him who he was talking to on the phone. She just trusted him completely, took his hand, and led him back to the master bedroom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She put him to sleep the same way he had put her to sleep before. The man who couldn't sleep before slowly fell asleep under her gentle comfort.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he opened his eyes, he saw Amelia holding a sketchpad, sitting on the edge of the bed, and contemplating a design.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing that she had been with him all the time and hadn't gone anywhere, James's heart was filled with warmth. His cold and snowy face even showed a hint of a smile. "Thank you, my wife..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She moved her gaze away from the sketchpad and looked at his stunning face bathed in the morning sun. "If you're awake, go wash up. We'll have breakfast together."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James was very obedient. He got up from the bed and went to the bathroom. When he came out, he had returned to his usual cold and noble appearance. "Let's go downstairs."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yesterday, Peter picked up Grace. This morning, while James was still sleeping, Amelia fed her breakfast and had Peter take the child to school.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, only the two of them, husband and wife, were left in the dining room. Amelia knew that James's stomach wasn't feeling well, so she had the chef stew some warm porridge and fed it to him herself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He cherished this kind of life, but there were some things he couldn't ignore. After breakfast, he said to her, "I'm going to the prison later."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia, who had just had his servant remove the dinner plate, turned around and gave him a glance, "What are you going to the prison for?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought of the lunatic in the prison, and his peach blossom eyes turned cold, "To see if my 'mother' is dead or not?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had heard from Stella that James had been whipped by G</span><span>loria</span><span> since childhood and had everything he cared about destroyed by G</span><span>loria</span><span>, including people.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The first time she touched him, she felt small scars on his back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought he had been injured in fights in society, but it turned out that he had been whipped with a belt by his own mother.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She couldn't imagine what kind of environment J</span><span>ames</span><span> grew up in as a child, but she knew that she felt sorry for him after hearing about his experiences.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>According to S</span><span>tella</span><span>, J</span><span>ames</span><span> survived by barely hanging on, and for him, just being alive was enough, he didn't care about anything else.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nowadays, A</span><span>melia</span><span>'s </span><span>dissatisfaction at </span><span>J</span><span>ames&rsquo; indifference </span><span>has been relieved. If she had a mother like his, she might be even more indifferent than him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, logically speaking, J</span><span>ames</span><span> hates G</span><span>loria</span><span>, but after talking to D</span><span>ominic</span><span> once, he wants to go see his mother. Why is that?</span></p></div>
