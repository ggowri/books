        <h1>Chapter 1950 The little devil</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>During Alexander's first three years, whenever James wanted to touch Amelia, he would come up with a plan.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He would first put Alexander to sleep and then carry him away.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Alexander would wake up after just one time and start crying loudly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In order to have some peace like before, James sent the child to Paul's house.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At first, it was fine, but after sending him too many times, Paul found it strange. After observing, he realized that James found his son to be a nuisance, which is why he sent him to Paul's house.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So every time James came to drop off his son, Paul would find an opportunity to mock him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But James had thick skin, so he would just put his son on the ground and leave without looking back.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, it didn't take long for Alexander to figure out James' trick of sending him away.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>According to Paul, Ken and Barbie, the siblings, would cry their hearts out every day because of Buzz Lightyear.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul felt that it was fine for Buzz Lightyear to bully the two older kids, but even he himself would be bullied by Buzz Lightyear.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul said that when Eva was at home, Alexander would behave perfectly, but once Eva left for work, Alexander would start causing trouble.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander didn't want the housekeeper to hold him, he wanted Paul to hold him. Although it wasn't difficult to hold him, holding him all day was exhausting.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if he had the strength of a fortress, he couldn't handle it. He had to send the little devil back.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia couldn't believe it. In her eyes, Alexander was well-behaved except for not speaking much.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva also thought the same. But Paul insisted that Alexander was pretending.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul must have been exhausted. He couldn't even lift his hands and just slumped in the chair, looking at James with a face full of grievances.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span> James only raised his eyebrows slightly and then placed his large and warm hand on Alexander's head.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's small body stiffened, he always felt that his old father had ulterior motives.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sure enough, when Alexander turned three, James sent him to kindergarten, in the same class as Ken and Barbie.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two siblings were scared and cried, saying they wanted to go home and find their parents to change kindergartens.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The teachers and principal at the kindergarten didn't understand, so they asked Ken and Barbie why they wanted to change kindergartens.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ken and Barbie pointed at Alexander and said that the big devil was here, and they didn't want to be in the same class as the big devil.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The teachers and principal followed the chubby little fingers and looked at Alexander, who was sitting in the corner, resting his cheek on his hand.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The boy was dressed in a small suit and a white shirt with a small tie tied above the collar.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His thick blond hair was combed back, making him look noble and spirited.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Most importantly, this boy was more handsome than the other children.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes, like the warm winter sun melting the snow, had a bewitching charm that made it impossible to look away.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He sat there silently, looking unbelievably well-behaved.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How could the teachers and principal believe that such a well-behaved and good-looking child could be the big devil?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead, they advised Ken and Barbie to get closer to their younger brother and even </span><span>arranged for the three siblings to rest in the same room during nap time.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This frightened Ken and Barbie even more. They couldn't convince the teachers, so they huddled together under a blanket, with their big round eyes staring at Alexander, who was sleeping next to them.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Alexander woke up from a long nap, he slowly opened his eyes and looked at Ken and Barbie, who had been staring at him without daring to sleep...</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Receiving their fearful glances, Alexander flashed an angelic smile, "You two can call me boss from now on, and I won't bully you anymore."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ken and Barbie, who were like little tyrants in their own home, refused to call anyone boss, especially Ken, who didn't even acknowledge it, "I'm older than you, you have to call me boss!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander snorted through his nostrils, not saying anything on the spot.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But afterwards, who knows what he did, all the kids in the kindergarten started calling him boss.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ken and Barbie were originally snacking, but when they saw Alexander coming in, they fiercely guarded their snacks.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Alexander waved his hand and all the kids behind him rushed over. In just a few moments, Ken and Barbie's snacks were all gone.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ken and Barbie were so angry that they cried loudly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander picked up a bag of snacks, walked over to the siblings with a swagger, and asked them with a smile, "Now, can you call me boss?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While wiping their tears with chubby hands, they pouted and asked, "If we call you boss, will you give us the snacks back?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander nodded and returned the snacks to them. From then on, Ken and Barbie not only changed their address, but also became his followers.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eventually, with their flattery, they became his right-hand men.</span></p></div>
