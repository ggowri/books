        <h1>Chapter 1715 Two Letters</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul furrowed his brow and followed James into the study, quickly taking a seat across from him at the desk. James opened a drawer and pulled out two envelopes, handing them to Paul.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If I don't come back in a month, please give this letter to Amelia."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The envelope was pink, and inside was a handwritten letter from him. Paul didn't know what it said, but he reached out and took the envelope, then looked up at James with a puzzled expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"James, where are you going?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James tightened his grip on the other white envelope in his hand, seeming to hesitate about something. He didn't answer Paul's question right away, and just as Paul was about to ask again, James made a decision and suddenly handed him the envelope.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If I don't come back in three months, please give this letter to Ryan."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul knew the relationship between Ryan and Amelia, but James brought up Ryan and even left a letter for him. It was obvious that James was leaving his last words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"James, where are you going and what are you going to do?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"James didn't tell him anything, how could Paul possibly relax?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James glanced at the impatient Paul, his expression revealing a hint of dissatisfaction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How can someone with your temperament manage the vast Evans' business?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't care if I can manage it well or not, all I know is if you don't tell me where you're going, there's no way I'm gonna be your messenger!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Paul finished speaking, he angrily threw the envelope in his hand and crossed his arms, turning away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul got married and had children, but he still had a childish side that James couldn't help but sigh at.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sometimes, I envy you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul grew up being spoiled by his family. He could throw tantrums anytime and anywhere without needing to be mature or composed, or consider the consequences...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But James, from childhood, was destined to never become the Paul of the Evans Family. He could only be mature and steady, and could only remain calm and composed. Even before doing anything, he needed to carefully consider and weigh the consequences, otherwise it would be irreversible."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul could sense the lack of strength in James' tone for the first time. He slowly turned to look at James. In his mind, James was always like an invincible steel body, unbeatable by anyone...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But this time, Paul saw through James' handsome appearance and saw him forcing himself to grow into a strong and unyielding tree.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps, in James' mind, he didn't want to take on so much responsibility, but he had to because the entire Evans family was relying on him...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul felt sorry and called out to him, but the handsome man across from him had already put away his sadness and returned to his usual cold demeanor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Listen, what I'm about to tell you, you can't breathe a word of it to anyone..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two brothers had a conversation in the study, but Amelia was unaware of what was said. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All she knew was that when Paul came out, his steps were unsteady and his eyes were scattered, as if he had been shocked by something and couldn't think of a solution. He could only weakly lean against the wall and slowly leave Blue Bay Island...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Amelia watched Paul's unsteady figure walk away, her heart tightened once again. She wanted to go to the study and ask James where he was going, but as she got closer to the study door, she slowly stopped in her tracks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since James didn&rsquo;t want to tell her, she wouldn&rsquo;t force him. She had always been obedient and well-behaved, so she would just be obedient and well-behaved once again. After all, he promised her that he would come back in a month.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia didn't know when James left, so she quickly went to the kitchen and started cooking. She made several dishes and even cooked soup. When she finished, she saw a black car parked outside the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Holden, dressed in a black suit, and Emelyn, wearing a red dress, stepped out of the car from the back seats on either side.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon seeing the two siblings, Amelia knew that they were here to pick up James. The dish she was holding suddenly felt heavy in her hands...</span></p></div>
