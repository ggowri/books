        <h1>Chapter 1675 Johnny’s evil guess</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Facing the icy James, the members of the Evans Family and the Clark Family were fine, but Ryan felt awkward. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't know how to face James and Amelia, feeling like his presence would affect them and make him stand out. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Ryan sitting in his wheelchair, silent and with his head lowered, Eva, who had already changed clothes, voluntarily sat beside him and talked to him. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Eva around, the loneliness emanating from Ryan gradually lessened, and he dared to lift his head and look at Amelia, who was sitting quietly across from him. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her hand was held by the man's long and big hand, placed on his thigh, and their intimacy was evident, indicating they had done it countless times to be so natural. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sensing the warm gaze, Amelia hesitated for two seconds before slowly raising her head. In that moment when her gaze met Ryan's, she curved her mouth, revealing a gentle smile. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing that pure smile without any impurities, Ryan understood that Amelia had let go and no longer felt awkward, so he didn't need to feel embarrassed either. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After bitterly smiling in his heart, Ryan also smiled back. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The process of the two exchanging smiles was noticed by Johnny, who occasionally glanced at Amelia. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't help but wonder what the relationship between Ryan and Amelia was and how they dared to exchange looks in this kind of situation. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he pondered, a thought suddenly rushed into his mind: Could it be that James is being cuckolded? Thinking of this, Johnny curled his lips and smiled, but because he couldn't hold it in, he laughed out loud. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the incredibly quiet cabin, an unexpected burst of laughter suddenly erupted, and everyone turned to look at him... </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Johnny instantly suppressed his smile and, expressionless, lifted his foot and kicked Herb hard. "Didn't you ask me to help you defeat James? What are you hesitating for?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Herb, who was inexplicably kicked, looked wronged and glared at Johnny before instructing the waiter to bring the cards. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Herb, who received the cards, skillfully shuffled them like performing magic, then held them in his hand. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He closed the cards, placed them on the table, and provocatively looked at James. "Let's play something simple today, not relying on intelligence or physical strength, just luck. Purely drawing number cards, how about it?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James glanced indifferently at Ryan, then coldly looked at Johnny before finally turning his disdainful gaze to Herb. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's the wager?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If we lose, we'll give you a private jet, two limited edition supercars, and three mansions in the city that never sleeps," Herb said, sweeping his gaze around before focusing on Paul. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If we win, the Clark Family will own this ship." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul: ... Wait a minute, the members of the Clark Family are gambling with James, so why is his unlucky ship involved? </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Plus two robots downstairs." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Deal." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul didn't have time to stop them, and the deal was already made. Paul could only put all his hopes in James. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"James, we must win!!!" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul grabbed his suit sleeve and cheered James on. "James, as long as you give the order, even if it's cheating, I'll help you." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Herb, who was shuffling the cards, rolled his eyes. "So the Evans Family relies on </span><span>such despicable methods, no wonder they took away so much of our business." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as this statement was made, it ignited a challenge. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Immediately, the members of the Evans Family stood up and confronted Herb. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What did you say?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Say it again if you have the guts!" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Herb looked up and saw a row of well-dressed, big-sized men in front of him. He immediately backed down. "I mean, there are too many of you in the Evans Family. It wouldn't be fair if we all fought together. Let's draw lots and distribute the teams." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Initially, it was supposed to be a battle between James and Herb, but others also wanted to participate, leading to the current situation where members of the Evans Family were facing off against members of the Clark Family. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, there were too many members in the Evans Family, while the Clark Family only had four, and Zack could only be counted as half, so the numbers were overwhelmingly against them. It was completely unfair.</span></p></div>
