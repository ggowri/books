        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a farewell drink, Henry boarded a plane bound for Panama. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia and Eva also went along for the trip. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Henry told Stella that he had won a medical award. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva told Stella that she had married Paul and was also expecting a child. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia had nothing to tell Stella because she hadn't gotten pregnant yet, not fulfilling Stella's wish. She squatted in front of Stella's grave, touched her tombstone, slowly stood up, and facing the sunset, softly spoke. "Stella, I wish you find Erin soon." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I wish you find the person you love and be with them forever... </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And she would try her best to listen to Stella's words and get pregnant soon, and then come and tell her. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the distribution of the company's shares completed, Paul got married and also met Stella, James had only one thing left to do - accompany Amelia to the Lawrence Family. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia helped Skender with a project, and after working day and night, she completed all the designs, leaving only the final project for the Lawrence Family. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once the Lawrence Family project was finished, Amelia would have fulfilled all of Skender's wishes, and her sister would no longer have any regrets. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia planned to announce Skender's passing after completing the Lawrence Family's design, and then resume her own identity to take on the design. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Previously, James had helped her establish a name in the architectural world under the name 'the Evans Headquarters', and everyone saw her abilities. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was the path James paved for her, so now she could take on many good projects under her own identity. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After putting pens, measuring tapes, and other drawing tools into a box, Amelia looked at Neil who was sitting on the couch filing his nails. "Neil, let's go." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Neil checked his round fingernails and found no issues, then looked at Amelia. "I suggest you trim yours too, Matty Lawrence is a neat freak." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia closed the box and couldn't help but find it funny. "Mr. Lawrence's neat freak tendencies, can they beat my husband's?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Neil supported his chin and thought for a moment. "I have witnessed Matty's neat freak tendencies, so I can answer that question for you." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia glanced at him. "Help me load the stuff into the car." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Neil reluctantly picked up a bunch of miscellaneous drawing tools and headed outside. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before leaving, Amelia repeatedly instructed Grace to stay with George at home, study well, and do her homework. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grace, who was only thinking about snacks, nodded obediently and waved her little hand at Amelia. "Auntie, don't worry, I'll listen to George." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia then looked at George. "You've worked hard these past few days." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>George waved his hand. "I'm happy to take care of Grace." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had originally wanted Eva to help take care of the child, but considering she was pregnant now, it wasn't convenient, so she troubled George to come back for a while. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After bidding farewell to the two, Amelia got into the car. James had prepared a private plane, and they all went directly to the airport and boarded the plane to England. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matty seemed to attach great importance to meeting Skender, so he specifically sent Dylan from the Lawrence Family to pick her up. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia was now appearing as Skender, as Skender had signed the contract specifying that only he could design. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James decided to let her and Neil go ahead, while he followed behind to protect her. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After discussing it, Amelia took out Skender's photo and did her makeup to look like him. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This makeup made Amelia almost identical to the person in the photo. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Neil saw it and tugged at the corners of his stiff mouth. "When did you learn this?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia put down the small mirror and raised an eyebrow at him. "Before I found out that I had to go to the Lawrence Family construction site." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, she had already won an international architecture competition with her true appearance. Although the Lawrence Family may not necessarily follow this kind of news, it was better to be prepared just in case. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, the plane arrived at the airport, and Amelia put on her sunglasses and followed Neil off the plane... </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as they stepped out of the airport, they saw Dylan in a black suit leaning against a Maybach, waving at them. "Miss Clark, Mr. Sherwood, this way please&mdash;"</span></p></div>
