        <h1>Chapter 1820 Dylan’s Story</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dylan stared at her for a few seconds before changing the subject, "Talk about yourself, stop always talking about me, it's boring." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia retorted with the same words, "I don't have much to say either, it's boring." Dylan smirked, "Don't be so guarded against me like I'm a thief." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia also laughed, "Your family is just as guarded against me like I'm a thief." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Why should she tell them about her own affairs?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia shook off the large curls falling in front of her chest and walked confidently into the dressing room. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Watching her beautiful figure, Dylan leaned back in his chair and smiled lightly. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He actually wanted to know how important James was to her, but then he thought it wasn't necessary to ask. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man who could make her go to Erebus to find him even while pregnant must be more important to her than her own life, but... a person so important was locked away in a place worse than death by his grandfather. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia would be heartbroken if she knew, wouldn't she? </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dylan's brow furrowed slightly as he thought about this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he was lost in thought, the Lawrence family's adopted child, carrying a few new bags, pushed open the door to the styling room. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When she saw him, she clearly hesitated for a moment, then turned and left, but Dylan stood up directly. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he brushed past her, he sneered, "What are you hiding from?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The girl held the door handle, didn't say a word, and only after he left </span><span>did</span><span> she sneak a glance at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dylan had confessed his love to her, saying he really liked her and if she was willing, he would tell his family and marry her. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she refused, and Dylan's mother said that the adopted child was also a part of the Lawrence family, and also Dylan's sister, so it was unreasonable. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The main reason was that she looked down on the girl's background, and the girl, being very self-aware, accepted Dylan's mother's arrangement and married the man she was set up with. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Dylan returned, the girl was already married. Dylan was a stable person, not causing a scene, but he confronted her backstage, asking her why. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The girl said she didn't like him, and Dylan didn't say anything more, just stared at her for a while, said "I wish you happiness," and left, never bothering her again. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Later, she heard that Dylan was going on blind dates everywhere, looking for someone suitable to marry, but he never found the right person, while she had already had a child. The girl sighed and didn't dwell on the past, pushing the door and walking in. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Dylan walked away, he stopped and turned to look at the styling room. Sometimes, he felt like a failure. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unrequited love, no achievements, and... wanting to make it up to his sister, but doing things to hurt her behind her back. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was rotten to the core and extremely hypocritical.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the dressing room, the stylist went to pick out a dress, and Amelia received a call from Johnny. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He asked where she was, and she told him honestly. Johnny frowned and told her to be careful. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia said, "The Lawrence family just wants to recognize me, they won't do anything to me, so you take care of Gigi." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Johnny nodded, "Also, I have something to tell you." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia asked, "What is it?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Johnny said, "My uncle came to Barcelona yesterday, he came to visit my sister, and I took the opportunity to ask him about something." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia furrowed her brows lightly, "Do you suspect Carson is...?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She couldn't speak freely, and Johnny understood, "If I'm not mistaken, he should be from Erebus, otherwise I wouldn't have been able to leave Erebus so smoothly." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had also suspected this before, and planned to wait until he was better to go find Carson and find out for sure, but because of Gigi's situation, he had put this matter on hold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Coincidentally, Carson came to Barcelona yesterday on business and came to see Gigi, so he took the opportunity to get Carson drunk and try to get some information out of him. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Carson's mind worked quickly and he didn't reveal any information to him, and even asked him why he was asking about these things, if he wanted to go gamble inside. Johnny felt that Carson's evasiveness was even more suspicious, and he planned to follow Carson after Gigi got better to see if he could find Erebus's location. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After listening, Amelia furrowed her brows slightly, "Will it be dangerous for you to follow him?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if it was just a little bit of concern, Johnny would feel happy, "Are you worried about me?"</span></p></div>
