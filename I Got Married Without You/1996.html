        <h1>Chapter 1996 You Aren't My James</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia, who had been seeking frantically in the snow, suddenly came to a halt. It was as though she had heard a soul calling, causing her to turn around in a daze. However, there was no one behind her, only the empty expanse of snow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Standing in place, she lifted her hand and placed it on her chest. Three heartbeats later, a wrenching pang shot through her, as if she were on the verge of losing something precious. Although she bent over, the pain refused to subside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her intuition told her that something had befallen James. Just as she resolved to persist in her search for him, a graceful figure carrying a rose emerged from the snow and stopped before her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Honey, didn't I tell you to wait for me? Why are you here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment Amelia saw James unscathed, her pounding heart instantly calmed down. Learning he was safe and present allowed her to feel at ease.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She threw away the umbrella in her hand. As excited and exhilarated as a rabbit in the woods, she dashed over and flung herself into James' arms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His warmth and breath made Amelia breathe a sigh of relief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Honey, do you know that I thought something had happened to you? I was almost scared to death."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James raised his hand, placed it on Amelia's long hair that was draped behind her, and stroked it lovingly, just like before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've promised to stay by your side and not go anywhere, so how could I have an accident easily?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nestled in his arms, Amelia gently nodded and embraced his waist tightly, cherishing the moment. After touching him somewhere, she abruptly stiffened and pushed him away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You aren't my James!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James had lost a lot of weight recently. When putting her arms around his waist, Amelia could already reach her elbows. Yet, the James in front of her was as robust as ever.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wasn't James.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At least he wasn't hers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia's mind suddenly went blank, as if she had realized something. After retreating a few dozen paces, she, like a madwoman, wheeled and rushed toward the snow-capped mountains.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander, who had gone out with her, heard her say that the tall figure standing there was not his father. He subconsciously ran over and grabbed James' wrist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Father, where is your watch?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the absence of this information, the machine in James' brain kicked into gear. After failing to get relevant details, he asked coldly, "What watch?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander immediately released his hand. After sizing him up in disbelief, he turned around abruptly like Amelia and followed her footsteps.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The snowfall intensified, threatening to engulf the forest in its endless precipitation. With her eyes bloodshot, Amelia trudged through the deepening snow to seek James.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unyielding, she marched briskly, steadfastly advancing step by step into the snowy mountains, devoid of tears or timidity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She contemplated, "James, I've come to terms with the thought of losing you. Why do you wish to shun me in your final moments? Are you afraid of letting me witness your passing?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But you know what? The most frightening thing in this world for me is not being able to find you even if I search the entire world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that case, I will even die with regrets after your demise. You must have known me well, and that is why you ventured alone into the mountains. Yet, you are unaware that this is even more difficult for me to bear than losing my life."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia's health was not that good, and she rushed out without donning extra clothing. Despite shivering from the cold, she remained determined in her quest for James.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Staggering and clutching onto the trees in the forest, with the help of the light reflected from the snow, she braved the heavy snowflakes and scoured every corner of the mountains for James.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The forest was so vast that no one had any idea where he had gone, but the increasing lights were guiding Amelia forward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment Amelia recognized that the robot was not James, Paul believed that everything James had spent so much effort on arranging could not outweigh her love for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul brought the doctors, the Evans family, the Lawrence family, and the Clark family and followed Amelia into the mountains, looking for James everywhere. If his soul were still there, he would hear everyone calling him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But no one's voice could compare to Amelia's silence. After walking for a while, she bent down and dug at the thick snow under her feet crazily with her weak hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once encountering something solid, she would lose control, sink into the snow, and desperately burrow into it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even when she accidentally grazed her finger on a dead tree, the pain wouldn't influence her. Despite her hands stained in blood, she continued her urgent search for James, who had vanished into the snow long ago.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Alexander mirrored Amelia's actions, fervently excavating snow whenever he encountered anything beneath his feet. It appeared that this was the only method he believed would lead him to James.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, resolute, Alexander reached for a metal watch that he had carefully selected. His name was engraved on the strap, allowing him to recognize it instantly without needing to inspect it closely, as it unmistakably belonged to James.</span></p></div>
