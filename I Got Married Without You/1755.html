        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Players, there are four common insects on the screen</span><span>. They&rsquo;re</span><span> </span><span>butterfly, firefly, moth, </span><span>and </span><span>dragonfly. They are placed in separate boxes. Which insect is in the box in front of you?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The black box in front of them was the only one, meaning they had to choose one of the four insects. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Five minutes, countdown starts now, 60, 59, 58..." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Johnny</span><span> subconsciously glanced at the scarred man across from him, who was listening intently to the numbers. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, a group of black-clad men rushed in as the white door in the backstage viewing area automatically opened. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A man with the number 1-2 on his mask walked in confidently. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cobra had never seen the founder behind the scenes before and his expression darkened. After 1-2 appeared, the surveillance in the gaming area paused on the scarred man's screen. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who invited the player?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It was me," Venom said nonchalantly as he stood up. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>1-2, dressed in black protective gear, emitted a chilling aura despite being fully covered. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"2-7 </span><span>accused</span><span> </span><span>you </span><span>of</span><span> </span><span>planting spies, Venom, come with me," 1-2 said. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Venom glanced at 2-7 and then extended his hands as the black-clad men behind 1-2 handcuffed him and led him away. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before leaving, Venom turned back and looked at Cobra. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both wearing masks, they couldn't see each other's expressions, but they </span><span>knew</span><span> </span><span>what </span><span>each other</span><span> had in mind</span><span>. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His departure meant the scarred man had been exposed. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Watching Venom's retreating figure, Cobra clenched his fists on his knees. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>1-2 didn't leave, instead, he took the computer handed to him by the black-clad men and began programming in front of everyone. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Within five minutes, he changed all the games on the fourth level. The contents of the boxes were quickly swapped as he programmed. This meant that the information received by the scarred man was all wrong. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cobra released his clenched fists and stood up directly. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man who was editing the code didn't even look up. "Anyone who steps out of the </span><span>viewing area will be shot on sight!" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The black-clad men beside him all drew their guns and aimed at the invitees in the viewing area. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After finishing his work, 1-2 closed the computer and turned back, looking at Cobra through his heavy mask. "1-3 says you're not bad, don't disappoint me," his voice was mechanical, and Cobra couldn't </span><span>tell who he was</span><span> by his voice. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But 1-2's words made Cobra suspicious. He had never met 1-3, so why did 1-3 say he wasn't bad? Did they all know him? </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However</span><span>, Cobra was now more concerned about the upcoming game. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stared at the surveillance screen with his cold eyes. The scarred man indeed received the wrong information and was unaware that the game had been altered. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Following the instructions provided earlier, he informed </span><span>Johnny</span><span> and Amelia, and then pressed the selection button. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were standing on a large circular landmark. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At first, they didn't know what it was for, they just stood on it. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now they knew. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the scarred man pressed the selection button, the circular landmark under his feet suddenly displayed the words "You lose." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, the circular landmark opened up, and before the scarred man could react, he fell in! </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah!" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the moment of the scarred man's scream, </span><span>Johnny</span><span> lunged forward to grab him, but he </span><span>failed</span><span>. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could only lie on the ground, watching the scarred man being swallowed by a swarm of snakes. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The punishment for the seventh round of the game was to be swallowed alive by snakes! Kneeling on the ground, Amelia saw the writhing mass of snakes and thought of Zack. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Holden said that Zack had replaced James in the seventh round of the game and was swallowed by the snakes. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that time, she didn't understand how Zack could have ended up in the snake pit, until she witnessed it with her own eyes. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She saw the scarred man with numerous snakes coiled around his neck, suffocating him, and then watched as his eyes were also swallowed by the snakes. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The gruesome sight made Amelia unable to stop crying. She covered her mouth, shivering</span><span> and wondering if</span><span> </span><span>Zack</span><span> also died</span><span> </span><span>that miserably.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't dare to think about it. Just thinking about such a scene made her cry uncontrollably. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the midst of her sobbing, the cold electronic voice sounded mercilessly, "Ten seconds left, please choose quickly, otherwise all of you will be thrown into the snake's </span><span>den</span><span>!"</span></p></div>
