        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He suppressed his restless heart and stared at Amelia intently, like a fierce beast. "Honey, after you give birth and recover, I may not let you go."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia raised her hazy eyes and looked at James's eyes filled with desire. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She suddenly remembered the scenes of being taken that night and couldn't help but shiver. "Can I not do it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing this, James deliberately stopped and raised his slender fingers to hold her chin. "Do you want it or not?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia, already aroused with desire, felt a bit embarrassed and stubbornly said she didn't want it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But James continued a few more times, making Amelia's face turn red and even more flushed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Honey, say it again, that you don't want it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia was about to speak when the tall and upright man leaned down and kissed a very sensitive spot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Mmm</span><span>..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I won't say it, please let me go..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James moved up to her ear and nuzzled her neck. "Honey, I want to hear you say that you want me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I won't say it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you sure?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm sure!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not long after, Amelia gave in. She hugged James's waist and lowered her head. "I want you..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James curled his lips, revealing a doting smile. "Good..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia was exhausted, and James held her and placed her on another clean bed before she fell asleep in a daze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James didn't sleep, he just held the woman nestled in his arms and gently patted her back, soothing her to sleep. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't that he didn't want to sleep, but he couldn't sleep, afraid that this moment would be too short-lived.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The happier James felt, the more prone he was to worry. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was always afraid of what would happen to Amelia and the child if he were to leave first.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He shifted his gaze and quietly looked out the window. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The bright moonlight shone on the windowsill, emitting a shimmering radiance, but it couldn't penetrate the man's heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next day at noon, Paul called. Amelia had just woken up and looked at the man answering the phone with her drowsy eyes. "What?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Eva is going into labor?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia quickly signaled for James to put it on speakerphone, and then she heard Paul's panicked voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, her water broke, and she was taken to the delivery room. What should I do? </span><span>What can I do?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't know."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James replied, and Paul instantly stopped panicking. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had never seen someone so indifferent in his life!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Paul, don't panic for now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Compared to James's indifference, Amelia was much more nervous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Notify your family to go help first, and James and I will come back immediately."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul, who was comforted by Amelia, felt a moment of warmth and peace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My parents are already on their way, Rebecca is coming too, and my sister..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul was clearly in a state of panic and kept mentioning names. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia interrupted him a few times, but he didn't stop.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia felt a bit helpless, and James directly extended his slender fingers and pressed the hang-up button. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then he lifted the blanket, fetched clothes, and helped her put them on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Evans family won't let anything happen to Eva, don't worry."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul was unreliable, but Rebecca was reliable. With her around, Eva would definitely be safe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As James had said, they received a call from Paul with good news as soon as they boarded the plane.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"James, Amelia, Eva has given birth!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What? So fast?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia and James were very surprised. It had only been forty minutes from the hotel to the airport.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The doctor said Eva is in good health and gave birth quickly."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What about Eva? Is she okay?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While Amelia was happy for Eva, she also immediately worried about her physical condition.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry, she's fine. She'll come out soon."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia breathed a sigh of relief upon hearing that Eva was fine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And is it a boy or a girl?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once it was confirmed that the mother was fine, the most important topic was the gender of the child.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She gave birth to twins, a boy and a girl!"</span></p></div>
