        <h1>Chapter 1908 Making a Choice</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that time, old Mr. Evans had just gotten home. He hadn't even settled into his sofa when he saw, through the floor-to-ceiling window, James' car recklessly driving into the villa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The grand, gilded gates were smashed open, sending the servants scurrying back in fear. The man who got out of the car didn't even spare a glance at the scene, storming angrily straight into the living room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dominic, you knew all along that giving birth would put her life in danger, yet you kept it from me. Now, she's in a situation where she could die from childbirth, or die if she doesn't give birth. Have you ever considered, if I lose her, whether I could go on living?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Facing James' questioning and anger, old Mr. Evans calmly picked up the water cup on the table. Unfortunately, before he could bring it to his lips, the man standing in front of him kicked it over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The cup was knocked over, and the scalding tea spilled onto the back of his hand. He could feel the heat on his skin, seeping through his wet clothes and pants, gradually cooling down. Only then did old Mr. Evans slowly lift his chin, looking up at the angry man in front of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"With genes like yours, you should be fathering an heir for the Evans family. But you insisted on marrying a woman who couldn't bear children. I sought medical help to enable her to conceive. Now that she can have children, you're blaming me for keeping it a secret. I can't </span><span>always cater to your whims, can I?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Such selfish words, coming from old Mr. Evans, were incredibly cold-hearted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James, infuriated by his cold-blooded grandfather, pulled out the golden knife from his waist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Old Mr. Evans was seeing James this angry for the first time and was instantly so scared that he held his breath in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"With such a strong negative energy in you, it's no wonder Amelia is facing the consequences!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment these words were spoken, James' expression tightened, and the knife in his hand instantly shifted direction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment the sharp blade whizzed past old Mr. Evans' ear and plunged into the sofa, he let out a huge sigh of relief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, old Mr. Evans lifted his incredulous eyes, staring at James, who was emotionless and had just pulled back his sharp knife.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're really going to raise your hand against me, all for a woman? Is there any family bond left between us?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She's dying, and you expect me to care about some damn family ties?! What kind of pathetic relative are you?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone at home, from the butler to the maids, knew that James never spoke so outrageously. This was the first time, which just goes to show how incredibly angry he must be at this moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But his anger meant nothing to old Mr. Evans. Sitting on the sofa, after a long silence, old Mr. Evans once again steadied his mind and spoke in a cold voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"James, it was wrong of me to ask the doctor to hide the risks of childbirth. But I've already asked the doctor to prescribe the best medicine to help Amelia strengthen her body and reduce the dangers during childbirth."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's her own fault for insisting on going on a business trip with you and stopping the medication prescribed by the doctor. Now she's suddenly developed pregnancy-induced hypertension, which has increased the risk during childbirth. You can't entirely blame me for this."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man gripping the golden hilt of his sword, his aura of hostility suddenly diminished because of those words. He couldn't entirely blame his grandfather, but...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If I had known earlier that having a child would put her life in danger, I would never have let her get pregnant. Even if it meant not having descendants, it wouldn't matter to me. All I want is for her to be safe and well. But you, you insisted on continuing the so-called lineage, gambling with her life."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James lowered his head, the anger in his eyes dissipated by heartache, leaving only a pale gaze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"From childhood till now, you've never stopped Gloria from beating me. You only asked her to spare my life. You kept me alive just because you thought I was useful. If I were useless, you would have let Gloria kill me a long time ago..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Back then, I was relieved, thankful that I was still useful to you, that I could keep on living. But now, I wish I was useless. That way, no one would care whether my wife gives birth or not..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The disappointment that shone in James' eyes was something old Mr. Evans had never seen before. It was like accidentally looking up and meeting the sincere gaze of a child, suddenly being struck by such a clean and pure look, hitting right at the heart of his scheming, making one feel instantly ashamed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"James, I..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"From now on, you and I are done. No more contact."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James dropped these final words, staggering out of the living room. If there was anyone to </span><span>blame, it was himself. If he hadn't gone to Erebus, she wouldn't have run out of medicine, and the risks of childbirth wouldn't have been so high. So blame him, blame him for everything...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a dazed expression, James crashed his car into the cliff's guardrail. The vehicle didn't fall, but half of it was hanging in mid-air. The man struggled to get out of the car and stood on top of the cliff, staring at the car as it plunged down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The only sound in his ears was the Dean's voice. Whether it was 10% or 30%, they were all demanding Amelia's life. But in such a situation, James had no way out. He could only force himself to calm down and decisively choose the latter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James clenched his fists tightly, his nails cutting into his palms until they bled. Only then, amidst the pain, did he let go. He took out his phone and dialed the Dean's number, "What are the chances of survival for a baby delivered at over seven months?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia adores children. If she were suddenly to lose her child, she would be devastated. All he could hope for then was to find a way to save her life, and at the same time, ensure that the child she was forced to deliver prematurely survived as well.</span></p></div>
