        <h1>Chapter 1771 Amelia dragged Brandon into the sea</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brandon was momentarily at a loss, and Emily noticed something was wrong with him, so she immediately asked, "Dad, why are you pleading for her?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Normally, whatever Emily asked Brandon to do, he would do it for her, even if it meant getting the stars from the sky. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crying on the other end of the phone was heart-wrenching: "Dad, I don't care why you're pleading for that b</span><span style="font-style: italic;">**</span><span>, but you have to help me kill her today, or I'll show you what it's like to lose me!" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Threats like this had always worked since she was little. Brandon turned to look at Amelia. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although he knew she was his daughter, and felt some guilt, compared to the emotionally distant Amelia, Emily, who he had raised and cared for since she was little, was naturally more important. So, he reluctantly agreed, "Okay." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emily finally stopped crying, but still had some concerns, "Record the video, I want to watch it over and over again to ease my anger!" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brandon, who loved Emily, agreed to her request and then hung up the phone, tossing it to the person next to him, saying, "Turn on the camera and record it." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After that, Brandon walked towards Amelia and said, "I can't watch my daughter die, so, Elvira, I'm sorry..." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing this, Amelia sneered, but before she could retaliate, Brandon reached out his hand. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When she pushed his hand away, Amelia grabbed his wrist and pulled him overboard from the ship. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since she couldn't escape, she wanted him to die together with her. At least she could help her mother get revenge! </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brandon seemed surprised that Amelia had pulled him into the sea. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he sank, he looked at Amelia, who was pulling him down with her... </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her hand was tightly holding onto his wrist, clearly intending to take him down with her. Brandon held his breath and desperately tried to push Amelia's hand away... </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she couldn't match a man's strength. Brandon managed to pry her fingers off one </span><span>by one, and then pushed her further into the sea... </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia reached out, and Brandon turned his head just in time to see her hand. He paused for two seconds, then, without looking back, swam away... </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Watching his retreating figure, Amelia suddenly remembered a saying: "A father's figure is as majestic as a mountain." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was true. Her biological father's figure was indeed majestic, but also very resolute... Her hand slowly let go, and the churning sea water enveloped her exhausted body, sinking her deeper and deeper. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unable to save herself, Amelia looked up and quietly watched the water... </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her life had been quite unfortunate. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had never felt the love of her parents, and didn't know what it was like to have a family. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought she would marry her first love, but fate separated them completely with a car accident and amnesia. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Following her uncontrollable emotions, she fell in love with a man who had helped her, but because of his circumstances, she had experienced death... </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought maybe God was starting to pity her, which is why he lent her sister's life to her, allowing her to live and learn the truth about James's love for her. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps, having made up for this regret, it was time for God to take her life back, so he sent her biological father to end it himself. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But her unborn child had suffered with her, and hadn't even had a chance to see the world before leaving with her. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What else was there? With the names etched in her mind, Amelia unconsciously closed her </span><span>eyes..</span></p></div>
