        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James frowned slightly, signaled Paul not to talk, then put his hand on Paul's shoulder and pressed hard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The tacit understanding between the brothers had existed for decades. Paul knew that James was afraid that his appearance would scare Amelia, so he followed his wish.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stood up without saying a word, held onto James' hand, and walked out with blood gushing from James' eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"James, I'll go call the doctor right now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After walking out of the villa, Paul immediately wanted to run down the snow-capped mountain. There was a wooden house not far away and the doctor was there. Paul had arranged it a long time ago, in case something happened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Paul."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James stopped him. When death really came, he was calmer than usual, and his voice was relieved. "The chip cut through my blood vessels, causing bleeding. It means that I'm dying. Even if there are thousands of doctors on standby, they can't save me from nerve exhaustion in my brain..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With his blood blurred vision, he forced himself to support his broken body and slowly walked down step by step. He stepped heavily into the snow, with one step deep and one step shallow, walking towards Paul.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The robot was at the bottom of the mountain. Please go and ask him to bring the roses to Amelia..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul looked at James, who were bleeding all over, and couldn't help but burst into tears. "James, what about you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James looked around at the snow-covered sky and said, "It is normal to be born in the flesh and die between heaven and earth. Just let me be buried under the snow forever."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul cried and shook his head. "James, if you want the robot to replace you, then so be it. But I can't let you be buried under the snow. No matter what, I will take you back to the Evans family's cemetery."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James smiled slightly, "Then wouldn't my previous plan have been in vain?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul reluctantly grabbed James' arm and said, "James, besides Amelia, you still have me and other brothers. You can't do everything just for her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was unclear whether it was blood or tears that rolled down James' eyes. Anyway, they were mixed together and kept dripping. The man stared at Paul firmly through the blood and tears. "Paul, I only have her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This sentence "I only have her" made Paul slowly loosen his arms. It was not because of the heartbrokenness, but because of the separation of life and death, which made him feel so painful that he couldn't do anything about it. "I will follow your last wish and bury you under the snow until Amelia finds you, and then I will take you home."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Paul crying, James endured the exploding pain in his head, raised his trembling fingers, and gently wiped away his tears. "In this life, I am lucky to have a brother like you. In the next life, you will be the older brother and I will be the younger brother. Then, I will serve you... all my life."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul couldn't hold anymore, he hugged James, crying uncontrollably. "James, your son said that his surgical experiment will be successful in two months. Can't you hold on a little longer?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When James wanted to say something more, the door of the villa opened. Amelia, wrapped in a beige coat and holding a transparent umbrella, stood on the steps, looking at them in the snow from a distance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Honey, I'll go with you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia opened the umbrella and was about to step down the stairs, but James' cold voice along with the wind and snow reached her ears first. "You go inside. Paul and I still have something to talk about."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The steps she had already taken slowly paused, her clean and pure eyes quietly gazing at the tall and beautiful figure. For some reason, she felt... very uneasy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wanted to disobey once, but James lowered his voice and said, "Honey, I told you to stay inside and wait for me to come back. Why are you so disobedient?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His voice was still full of strength, as if he was blaming Amelia for not listening to him, and also scolding her for disturbing him talking business. Amelia turned around, and planned to go inside and wait for him obediently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Amelia."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she turned around, she heard James' voice from her behind again. Amelia slowly turned her head and looked at the tall and graceful man standing in the snow from a distance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He never turned around, only tilted his head slightly, and looked at the figure that was engraved deeply in his bones and memory out the corner of his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's okay, go inside... and wait for me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"James..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia took a step forward, but he had already turned around, stepped on the thick snow, and walked towards the house opposite the villa. That was the room they were staying in temporarily. He should be going to get the roses...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Snowflakes flew by and landed on James' long eyelashes, condensing into thin ice flowers like frost, covering the blood in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul supported James and wanted to take him to see the doctor, but he pushed Paul to get the robot. His staggering steps and anxious expression showed that he was about to collapse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"James, where should I find you from now on?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The blood that flowed from James had already rolled onto the white snow. In an instant, it was covered by the falling snowflakes silently, as if no blood had ever fallen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't know where Paul should find him. He only knew that if it was any later, Amelia would be suspicious. In order to ensure that everything was foolproof, he pushed Paul downward without saying a word.</span></p></div>
