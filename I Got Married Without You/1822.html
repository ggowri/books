        <h1>Chapter 1822 A familiar golden leaf</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My daughter and granddaughters have finally returned to the Lawrence family." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Matty's voice fell, the whole room erupted into enthusiastic applause. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing the applause, Matty was particularly pleased and invited everyone to have a drink. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone surrounded Matty, congratulating him on finally finding his children. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only Amelia took a few steps back, withdrawing from the lively crowd. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She walked to a secluded, deserted area and looked up at the starry night sky. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had always thought that finding her family would make her very happy, but now she only felt lonely. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought that if James were by her side, she would happily acknowledge her relatives. Having both family and a loved one by her side would be the happiest thing in the world. "Do you miss him?" Dylan, dressed in a black tailcoat, with his hands in his pockets, strolled leisurely to her. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He happened to see the starry sky in her eyes and followed her gaze upward. "The night sky is the same everywhere, but some people can see it, and some people can't..." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For example, James, who was locked up, couldn't see it, which was a bit pitiful and a bit sad. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia knew it was Dylan without looking at him, and continued to gaze at the starry sky, responding faintly. "Why doesn't anyone ask James why he's not by my side?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had always been puzzled. The Lawrence family seemed to know in advance that she was divorced, even though only a few people knew about it. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How did the Lawrence family find out in advance? </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dylan lowered his eyes and glanced at Amelia's pure and beautiful face. "If you put the family tree back in the study, you'll know the answer." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After hesitating for a long time, he handed the family tree to Amelia. "Don't tell anyone that I asked you to put the family tree back in the study." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia, with clear eyes, glanced at the family tree and then at the strange Dylan. "What do you mean?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dylan didn't say anything, just placed the family tree in her hand and turned to leave. Halfway there, he stopped under a streetlight and looked at her from the side. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't blame me." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that time, he didn't know that Amelia was his sister, nor did he know that James was her husband, so she shouldn't blame him. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since being chosen by his grandfather, he had lost the ability to choose. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His life was not his own, and he couldn't resist. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Dylan was very clear that some things would be known sooner or later. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Watching Dylan's mysterious figure, Amelia was puzzled, but somehow felt that Dylan wouldn't harm her. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia chose to trust Dylan, took the family tree, avoided the crowd, and walked through the side door of the courtyard, up the steps, and towards the upstairs study. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had never been to Matty's study before, and it felt unfamiliar. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the study was not large, and she could see the bookshelf at a glance. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She found the empty space on the bookshelf, opened the glass door where the family tree was placed, and saw a small box next to it. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The books on Matty's bookshelf were all placed in glass cabinets by series, and even the family tree was placed separately, not scattered around. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only the small box seemed to be casually thrown there. Amelia knew at a glance that this was Dylan's answer to her. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After putting the family tree back, she quickly took out the box and opened it. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the box unfolded, Amelia was astonished to see a familiar golden leaf. In the light, the golden leaf sparkled, but it hurt her eyes. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia steadied her torn mind, reached out her fair hand, took out the leaf, and turned it over to the side with the inscription. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On it was a small set of numbers: Erebus-dominate-1-1&mdash;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia stared at the set of numbers and quickly realized that Matty was the founder of Erebus. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No wonder they never asked James why he wasn't by her side, because they had known where James was all along. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It also explained why Dylan never told her what he did; it turned out he was involved in these unspeakable activities.</span></p></div>
