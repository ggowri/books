        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But no matter how embarrassed she was, Kate stubbornly said, "Even if she is your wife's sister, if she wants to marry into our family, she still needs my consent. Don't I have the right to talk to her?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a moment of silence, James coldly asked, "Who said Ms. Miller wants to marry into your family?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kate instinctively refuted, "If she didn't want to marry into our family, then why would she have been entangled with my son for five years?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lounging lazily on the couch, James, with a hint of indifference, smirked, "It seems like you don't really understand your son."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If she didn't understand her own son, then who did?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't think so, "Paul is my biological son, I raised him, and I spoiled him. No </span><span>one knows him better than I do."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James didn't argue with stubborn Kate, he simply said, "You probably don't know that after Paul and Ms. Miller broke up, he spent two years trying to get back together with her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kate's expression froze, somewhat shocked, as she looked at James and said, "With Paul's personality, there's no way he would spend two years trying to get back together with a woman, it's impossible!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't believe her own son would do such a thing. In her impression, Paul changed girlfriends like changing clothes and never really invested his true feelings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought that the reason they were entangled for five years must be because Eva wanted to marry into a wealthy family and used every means to keep Paul.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Knowing that James was biased, Kate naturally wouldn't speak ill of Eva in front of him, so she said tactfully, "Paul wouldn't do that. It must be Ms. Miller who is clinging to him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James shook his head, "If it was Ms. Miller clinging to Paul, then she wouldn't have immediately rejected Paul's proposal after you contacted her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kate countered, "She rejected him because she wanted to play hard to get. Her goal is to make Paul deal with me. After my relationship with Paul breaks down, she can marry him. Otherwise, she would have begged me to let them be together, but she didn't do that. Instead, she encouraged Paul to come back and tear our family apart."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James sighed, "Ms. Miller didn't come to beg you, which means she doesn't want to marry into your family. And Paul came back to deal with you because he loves Ms. Miller more. It's because he loves her more that he's clinging to her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kate didn't agree with James' explanation, "He's just a childish kid. Look at what he did when he came back. It's enough to prove that he hasn't grown up yet. How can a child like him understand love? Besides, he did all this because he feels controlled by me and wants to find a way to get what he didn't get."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In other words, Kate simply didn't believe that Paul loved Eva. Realizing the crux of the problem, James coldly said, "Before meeting Ms. Miller, Paul may have been a playful person, but after meeting her, he stopped fooling around..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James paused for a moment, then lifted his icy gaze and stared coldly at Kate, "What do you think he stopped fooling around for? Was it because of Ms. Miller's methods? If it was because of her methods, then why didn't he entangle himself with Elsie for five years? And back then, Paul was even younger, didn't he still have a childish nature?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Kate was a skilled negotiator, then James, whom she encountered, was an opponent who couldn't find an opportunity to counterattack. For example, at this moment, just as she was about to speak, James directly cut off her voice with a cold tone:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Also, if someone can bind Paul for five years with just the methods of a woman, then I absolutely won't let someone so easily swayed by desire take on the position of President in the North American region. It's because I have seen Paul's changes and growth that I entrusted him with the position of President. If you don't trust him, does that mean you don't trust me either?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If the supportive words for Ms. Miller earlier were not enough to convince Kate, then </span><span>the sentence "If you don't trust him, does that mean you don't trust me either?" was clearly a warning to Kate, telling her that if Paul hadn't grown, he wouldn't have risked the entire Evans family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It turned out that James entrusted such an important position to him because he saw Paul's growth. Kate thought that Paul got this position because he had a better relationship with James compared to his younger brothers, but she didn't realize James wasn't that shallow.</span></p></div>
