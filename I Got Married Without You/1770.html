        <h1>Chapter 1770 How could you spare her?</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia pushed away Brandon's hand in disgust. "Thanks to you, she's dead too." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sumasa</span><span> starved to death on the streets of England, Skender ended up in the slums, and </span><span>Amelia</span><span> became an orphan, all because of Brandon. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He caused the separation of the three of them, and they each went down a miserable path. Meanwhile, Brandon raised Emily to be a socialite and paved the way for her. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After recovering from his surprise, Brandon reached for Amelia's hand again. "How could she be dead? What happened?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia pushed him away again, "Stop pretending to care about them and answer my question. Why did you help Sarah back then?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She knew how </span><span>Sumasa</span><span> was killed by Brandon, but she didn't know why he helped </span><span>Sumasa</span><span>. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Did he know from the beginning that Sarah's identity was </span><span>Sumasa</span><span>, and that she had a huge inheritance, which </span><span>wa</span><span>s </span><span>why he did it?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite Amelia's attitude, Brandon didn't get angry. Instead, he calmly studied Amelia's face. "I saw your mother walking the streets of England with a completely different face, and I felt sorry for her. </span><span>So</span><span> I brought her home, fed her, gave her a place to stay, and encouraged her to keep going." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Later, when my company was on the verge of bankruptcy, I met her at the airport. She had plastic surgery and I didn't even recognize her. It was only when she told me that I realized she was the person I had helped." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"To thank me, she gave me money to save my company, the Moore Group. I'm grateful to her, so I married her, had a child with her, and wanted to live a good life with her." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia believed the first two, but not the last one. Because </span><span>Sumasa</span><span> had said in a video that Brandon only married her for her money, and that the person he loved was his childhood friend Eliza. He had a family with her while also having a family with Eliza outside. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brandon used her mother's assets and abilities to make the Moore Group a giant, and then kicked </span><span>Sumasa</span><span> out</span><span>, who had helped him, to the curb. He even bought a big ship and tricked her into taking a trip with her child. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, on the ship, he pushed the three of them off. He didn't need </span><span>Sumasa</span><span> anymore, and </span><span>that</span><span> wa</span><span>s </span><span>when Brandon tore off his mask of hypocrisy. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brandon didn't try to defend himself too much. He just stared at Amelia's face and couldn't help but reach out to touch her. "Your mother's original face was so beautiful..." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sumasa</span><span> had kept her</span><span> past, identity, and appearance a secret from </span><span>Brandon</span><span>. Otherwise, when Amelia first entered the Moore Group, he would have recognized her. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia stepped back to avoid Brandon's touch, and the disgust and hatred in her eyes were clear. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brandon saw it, but didn't get angry. He just smiled. "By the way, I </span><span>named you Elvira</span><span>." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He walked up to Amelia and, as a father, patted her shoulder. "I wanted you to grow </span><span>up in warmth, so I named you Elvira. But then..." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Later, you got blinded by greed and selfishness,</span><span> and</span><span> you </span><span>destroyed me,</span><span>" </span><span>Amelia cut him off coldly, leaving</span><span> Brandon speechless</span><span>.</span><span> </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And he was </span><span>unable to argue with the truth Amelia had spoken. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Brandon silently stared at Amelia's face, his phone in his pocket suddenly vibrated. It was Emily calling. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brandon saw the incoming call on the screen, avoided Amelia's gaze, and turned to answer the phone. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emily immediately asked, "Dad, did you kill Amelia?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brandon turned back to look at Amelia, hesitated, and said, "Emily, she hasn't done anything to harm you. Maybe we shouldn't kill her..." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dad, what are you saying?" Emily was furious, standing up from the sofa. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If it wasn't for her, James would have married me a long time ago. She stole my sweetheart and even caused me to have plastic surgery. How can you spare her?"</span></p></div>
