        <h1>Chapter 1836: Brief Reunion</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once Matty finished speaking, he left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His departure activated a countdown in James' brain from the implanted chip, serving as a warning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The countdown, along with Amelia's potential pregnancy, was a threat - if James broke their agreement, Matty would take drastic action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Regardless of James' hints or Amelia's suspicions, Matty's goal was their permanent separation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matty could easily terminate Amelia's pregnancy at any time, and the chip kept James trapped in Erebus, unable to protect Amelia or their unborn child.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, his priority was to escape and confront Matty. Until then, their reunion was destined to be brief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Overwhelmed, James hid his pain, yanking off his mask.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia, seated at the center, did the same.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As their eyes met, a blush crept into their eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They remained silent until the countdown broke it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James, shadowing his face, walked over to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You...," he began, voice tight, "You said we'd never see each other again. I believed you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia glanced at </span><span>him,</span><span> his figure hidden by the light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't we all say things we don't mean when we argue? Are you still upset?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James nearly teared up at her words but held it back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why would I be upset?" Amelia shot back, her neck rigid.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, she gestured for him to sit, pulling out a chair. James steadied himself and sat down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he complied, Amelia said softly, "Cameras are watching. Let's watch our words. I'll fill you in, alright?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her voice was comforting, like a gentle stream, unlocking his emotions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James gazed at Amelia, consenting with a nod. He leaned in closer to her, feeling her warm breath tickle his ear, a reminder of his humanity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia, unaware of his thoughts, whispered, "I won't tell how I met Matty. Let's cut to chase. You know Matty, I've sent Erebus's location to Andrew. You're free to leave Erebus as 1-1. Rejoin Andrew, do what you want. I'll stay here, with access to all areas. If you return, I'll let you in."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia's plan was impeccable, leaving James impressed. Her eyes sparkled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she likely didn't know Matty was watching everything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Would cunning Matty let her expose Erebus? He'd likely intercept her message.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Still, Amelia was brave and loved him deeply, yet he was about to disappoint her again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why are you silent?" Amelia asked, stepping back and studying his handsome face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James listened to the countdown, his expression shifting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Amelia, don't fret over this."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But... if he's controlling you, how can you leave without my help?" Amelia asked, puzzled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He's not controlling me. I... can come and go from Erebus," James replied, gripping his lap, his softer tone still leaving Amelia cold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shocked, she looked at James, feeling a sudden distance between them.</span></p></div>
