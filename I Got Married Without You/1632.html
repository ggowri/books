        <h1>Chapter 1632 Don't look, you'll go blind</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James listened to Amelia, Amelia listened to Eva. If he could get Eva, he would have all the power in his hands. Why would he still be afraid? </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the logic sorted out, Paul took a bold move and hung up the phone before turning around. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the moment Paul turned around, James, who was agile, quickly pushed open the car door. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as the master bedroom door was opened, Amelia turned her head and hadn't seen what was coming out yet when her eyes were covered by a big hand. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, a cold and pleasant voice came into her ears, "Don't look, you'll go blind." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With her eyes covered, Amelia smiled to herself. Was her husband afraid that she would see Paul's revealing clothes? </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But...if just one look would make her go blind, then what about Eva? </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Eva saw Paul suddenly appear, her face turned as red as an apple. She rushed over, pushing Paul back into the room while complaining, "Didn't I tell you to stay inside? How did you come out?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul frowned, "I'm not some disgusting thing that will hurt your eyes. Why can't I come out? Besides&mdash;" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before he could finish his sentence, he was forcefully pushed back into the room by the strong Eva. After locking him inside, Eva grabbed the doorknob, turned around, and looked at the couple. "We didn't do anything last night, do you believe us?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James had no expression on his face as he looked at her... </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva, feeling uncomfortable being stared at, quickly changed the subject, "Amelia, how about we go to the living room?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Amelia heard this, she quickly poked her head out from between James' hands </span><span>and said, "Sure&mdash;" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva, who casually suggested in an attempt to ease the awkwardness, thought Amelia would say that they wouldn't disturb them today and would leave first. Who knew she would say "Sure." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Helpless, Eva covered her face and ran downstairs, saying, "Follow me..." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laughing, Amelia said, "Honey, I'll just say a few words to Eva and then I'll go to the car to wait for me..." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James' cold and indifferent eyes stared firmly at the master bedroom door, "You go, I'll stay here and wait for Paul to come out&mdash;" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man eavesdropping at the door, hearing this sinister voice, decided that he would rather die than go out&mdash; </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the guest area, Amelia and Eva sat on the sofa, staring at each other. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After staring at each other for a while, Amelia broke the ice first, "Did you make up with Paul?" Eva, who was still blushing, smiled awkwardly again, "No, I just accidentally drank too much, and then..." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Understanding, Amelia nodded, "How is it?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva thought Amelia was asking how she felt, so she quickly shook her head, "Not good, it happened too many times, and it's a bit uncomfortable..." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia laughed, adjusted her sitting position, and said, "What I mean is, did Paul say he wants to marry you?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva, suddenly realizing, blushed again. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing her like this, Amelia couldn't help but cover her mouth and laugh, "Eva, this is the first time I've seen you so shy..." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Originally just a secret affair, now it was known to many people. How embarrassing for Eva. Amelia looked at the shy Eva and the haze from losing Stella these past few days gradually dissipated. "Eva, if Paul proposes to you, would you say yes?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Getting to the point, Eva hesitated, "Do we need to go that far?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her resistance was not very obvious, and Amelia understood. She tried to persuade her, "You saw what happened to Stella and Erin. It's regrettable that two people who love each other ended up dying together. If you have feelings for Paul, don't reject him anymore..." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul now was different from before. He had matured, taken responsibility, and treated Eva wholeheartedly. Just liked Stella said, it's actually quite good. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking of Stella and Erin, the shyness in Eva's eyes faded, replaced by regret. "Paul is not Erin. He's not crazy or paranoid. At most, he gets angry and makes sarcastic remarks when he's upset, acting like a child. And I'm not Stella. I haven't experienced being hurt by the person I love. At most, I'll just feel a little sad when I see Paul with other women." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In other words, they wouldn&rsquo;t be as intense as Stella and Erin. Their relationship would be ordinary and calm, so they would never reach the same as Stella and Erin... </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But it's still regrettable to become the most familiar stranger, isn't it?" Amelia said, adding a probing sentence, "Of course, if you don't have feelings for him, you won't feel regret." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva was different from Stella. Her love and hate were always on the surface, and </span><span>Amelia could see through her easily. She could feel that Eva has feelings for Paul. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was just that Eva was afraid and didn&rsquo;t dare to bet her future on Paul. But life was short, and the years passed quickly. Why wasted time?</span></p></div>
