        <h1>Chapter 1809 Cry on my shoulder</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia later went to see Gigi. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was lying on the hospital bed, looking out the window. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was overcast outside, with no sunlight, making the room feel cold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia stood in front of the ward for a long time before slowly walking to the bedside. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you mind if I sit down and talk?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gigi did not respond or stop her, just remained quietly gazing out the window.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia's gaze shifted from Gigi's face to the two restraints tied around her waist. Johnny had mentioned that Gigi had lost her mind and had to be restrained by the hospital staff after she had attacked doctors, nurses, and orderlies. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If the doctors diagnosed Gigi as mentally ill, Samuel might personally send her to a mental hospital. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Losing her partner, her child, and freedom, Gigi</span><span> was very miserable</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia didn't want to see a repeat of Stella's situation, so she gathered her courage to come and see Gigi. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She noticed </span><span>the </span><span>scars on Gigi's wrist, probably from a suicide attempt after losing her child.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia thought about Gigi's tragic life and couldn't help but reach out and touch her cold fingers. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She expected Gigi to push her away, but instead, Gigi held onto her hand. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's been a long time... since anyone came to see me," Gigi said. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Except for her brother, everyone had abandoned her. She felt like a clown, a laughingstock, and everyone mocked her for becoming a crazy person over a man. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feeling Gigi's grip on her hand, Amelia also held on firmly, not minding her previous madness or fearing that she might suddenly lose control and hurt her. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In Amelia's eyes, Gigi wasn't a madwoman; she had just lost the love of her life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gigi's vacant eyes slowly moved to Amelia's still red face. "</span><span>How are you feeling</span><span>?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia touched her face and replied, "Much better."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After staring at her for a while, Gigi smiled awkwardly. "I want to touch your injuries, but I can't move." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia looked at the restraints and then proceeded to help Gigi untie them. Gigi thought Amelia would mock her for her behavior, but to her surprise, Amelia untied her without a word. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gigi propped herself up and made room for Amelia. "Stay with me for a while." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She patted the space beside her, expressing her loneliness and longing for companionship.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Most people would have been afraid, but after a moment of hesitation, Amelia took off her shoes and lay down beside Gigi. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She opened her arms and gently patted her shoulder. "If you want to cry, you can lean on my shoulder."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gigi initially denied wanting to cry, but as she laughed, tears flowed down her cheeks like a river. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Like a helpless child, she suddenly buried herself in Amelia's arms and began to sob </span><span>uncontrollably. "Zack is gone, and my child is gone..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If she had been a little stronger, like Amelia, would her child still be alive? These thoughts filled Gigi with guilt and remorse, and she cried with a trembling voice. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you think Zack </span><span>blame</span><span>d</span><span> </span><span>me for not protecting our child, so he took the child away?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia hugged Gigi tightly. "He wouldn't blame you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why did they all leave me then?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia couldn't answer that question, so she could only comfort her with a hug. "Amelia, if it were James who died, would you </span><span>die with him</span><span>?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The truth was, Amelia would.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But </span><span>she</span><span> </span><span>couldn't say that to Gigi. </span><span>So, she changed the topic, </span><span>"Gigi, you're still very young..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She could only </span><span>console</span><span> </span><span>Gigi</span><span> in this way</span><span>, just like Johnny did.</span></p></div>
