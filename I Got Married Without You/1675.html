        <h1>Chapter 1675 Waiting for a whole year</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul held Eva, who was sound asleep, for a while before reaching out and embracing her from behind. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew he lacked integrity, never following through on his promises and often going back on them. But only he knew that in that moment of holding her, his heart filled with anger, confusion, and restlessness suddenly calmed down. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He understood that he loved Eva even more, so he was destined to endure more grievances than Eva. However, as a man, he didn't mind being a little mistreated as long as he could hold her like this for the rest of his life...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul held Eva tightly and slept peacefully, even in his dreams they were a happy family of three. Eva was awakened by the pressure, as Paul's sleeping position wasn't very comfortable. His hands and feet were entangled around her like a giant snake. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She opened her eyes and struggled a bit, but he didn't let go. Eva suppressed her irritation and gently poked the man behind her with her elbow. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop making noise, I'm so sleepy..." A hoarse voice, tinged with a childish tone, came. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva slowly withdrew her hand, exerted some effort to turn her body, and looked at Paul with closed eyes. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sunlight outside the French windows streamed in through the white curtains, creating scattered spots of light that fell on his handsome face, making him look somewhat attractive. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva stared at Paul like this for a while, then raised her hand and patted his face. "Paul, if you keep pressing me like this, you'll crush our baby in my belly." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul, who was awakened by the pat, grabbed her hand and pulled her into his embrace. Resting his chin above her head, he let out a hoarse voice from his throat. "Don't talk nonsense; our baby will definitely be born safe and sound." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These words flowed into Eva's heart like a warm spring, making her feel warm...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul wasn't someone who liked to sleep in. After holding Eva for a while, he gradually woke up. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He lowered his head and looked at Eva in his arms. He had seen her wake up many times before, but never had he felt as delighted as he did at this moment. "Wife." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The ambiguous word and the passionate look made Eva a bit defenseless. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She lowered her eyelashes, wanting to avoid it, but Paul grabbed her chin. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With her head forced up, she hadn't even had a chance to meet his gaze when Paul kissed her. Their lips lightly touched, accompanied by heavy breathing, gradually turning into a bold deep kiss. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lost in the kiss, Paul flipped Eva over and pressed her beneath him. His roaming hand gradually moved from her lower abdomen towards her thighs...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feeling that something was off, Eva immediately pushed him away. "I'm pregnant, don't mess around..." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul had no choice but to retract his hand and instead wrap his arms around her waist. "How long do I have to wait before I can mess around?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva, who was being embraced by him, looked at the impatient Paul and said, "As long as the agreement lasts, you have to wait as long." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul's attempt to lightly kiss her neck suddenly stopped. "A whole year?!" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In reality, it could be after three months, as long as they were cautious, but Eva didn't want to, so she deliberately deceived Paul. "What do you think?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Three years younger and lacking experience, Paul could only grit his teeth and endure it. "Then I won't touch you anymore to avoid hurting the baby." Eva nodded quickly. "Okay, good boy."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul didn't like Eva treating him like a little brother. He grabbed her plump cheeks and forcefully corrected her, "I'm your husband, don't talk to me like that." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Husband... Eva repeatedly chewed on this title in her mind, a faint smile gradually appearing on her face. "It's already eight o'clock, you should go to work." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul lowered his head and kissed her forehead. "I'm not going to the company today; I have something else to take care of. I'll be back soon, just wait for me at home." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without waiting for Eva to ask, Paul uncovered the blanket, got out of bed, and headed straight to the bathroom. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, the sound of a car leaving the estate could be heard from downstairs. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Watching him leave, Eva also got up to freshen up. She had planned to handle work at the nightclub, but the butler wouldn't allow it, saying it was Paul's instructions for her to rest at home. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva hadn't returned to her home country for a month, and the nightclub manager had contacted her many times, urging her to come back. Now that she had finally returned, she wasn't allowed to go out. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She became a little anxious and sat down in the living room. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The butler noticed her unease and quickly brought over some nourishing food for pregnant women and placed it on the table. "Madam, the young master asked me to buy these specifically for you. Give them a try." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva said, "Thank you," and picked up a few bites. There was no fishy taste, so she </span><span>couldn't help but eat a few more bites. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing her enjoying it, the butler, Hans, finally smiled. "Madam, you're pregnant. Paul doesn't want you to work outside for the sake of you and the baby. Don't be angry with him." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva understood this reasoning. "I'm not angry, Hans, you don't have to worry." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had been with Paul for three years, occasionally coming and going from this place, and Hans had always been good to her. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing that Eva wasn't angry, Hans chatted with her for a few more moments before turning to attend to his own tasks.</span></p></div>
