        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one paid attention to whether Johnny left or not; everyone was focused on James, whose shoulder was bleeding profusely. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sir, please put down madam, and we will take you for treatment first." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Peter reached out his hand, intending to take Amelia from James, but James held onto her and took a step back. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James's action conveyed a clear message: no one was allowed to touch his wife. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lead the way." James raised his chin, gesturing for Peter to lead the way. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Peter, who had snapped out of his daze, quickly withdrew his hand. "Sir, this way." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James held Amelia tightly and followed Peter, quickly leaving the biochemical area of Erebus. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once they reached the surface, James placed Amelia in the helicopter before turning to face the members of S. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The revenge has been avenged. You no longer need to follow me. Disband here." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After giving his instructions, James turned to board the helicopter, but was stopped by the members of S. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sir, we are willing to leave S, but please allow us to continue following you." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if they no longer carried out missions, they still wanted to be with someone like James, who was loyal and responsible. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Facing the setting sun, James turned his head slightly and looked at Amelia, who was worried about his injuries inside the helicopter. "As you can see, </span><span>my life from now on belongs only to my wife</span><span>." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, James's cold and indifferent gaze shifted to Holden. "I leave them to you." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James turned and quickly boarded the helicopter. Andrew followed swiftly, and Peter followed suit. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inside the cockpit, Andrew frowned when he saw Peter joining them. "Why are you still here?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Peter took out a medical kit and replied as he opened it. "I am not only a member of S, but also the bodyguard of boss&rsquo; wife." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Peter took out a hemostatic agent and looked at Amelia, who was still staring at </span><span>James's wound, unsure of what to do. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madam, I am capable of treating gunshot wounds. Would you like me to stay and treat your husband?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia, filled with helplessness, looked at Peter as if he were a lifeline and nodded. "Yes, please." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the permission of the lady, Peter proudly turned to Andrew. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You see, it was boss&rsquo; wife who personally asked me to stay!" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Andrew rolled his eyes at him, but in their current situation, they couldn't do without Peter. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Andrew snorted but didn't argue further., he gripped the control handle and quickly started the helicopter... </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the aircraft took off, Peter skillfully cut open James's shirt. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sir, let me stop the bleeding first. We can perform the surgery and remove the bullet once we reach the hospital." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, Peter sprinkled the wound with medicine, and James tightened his grip on Amelia's hand instinctively. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia felt his pain and quickly extended her other hand to hold his, pulling it close to her chest. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If it hurts too much, you can pinch me." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James chuckled softly and wanted to reply, "Silly, how could I bear to pinch you," but he noticed Peter smirking. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a single glance, Peter immediately wiped the smile off his face. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the ground, the people watched the helicopter quickly disappear into the distance, suddenly unsure of what to do next. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Davies, Mr. Shawn has left S. What should we do?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Holden slowly withdrew his gaze and looked at the members behind him. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"To be honest, my godfather raised us only to use us. Now that Erebus has been breached, but Matty is still out there. He will seek revenge against my godfather, and there will be bloodshed. So, let's follow Mr. Shawn's instructions and disband here." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After hearing Holden's words, the members of S looked at each other and didn't fully understand. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Holden patiently explained Master Davies's intentions. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once they understood, they agreed to disband but told Holden that they would be there to help if he, Emelyn, or Mr. Shawn needed assistance. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Holden watched as the members left with the 48 bodies from the biochemical area, each flying away in their own helicopter.</span></p></div>
