        <h1>Chapter 1704 A tentative conversation</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Realizing this, she didn't ask any further. But Dylan casually said, "I didn't understand my grandfather before either. It wasn't until I grew up that I realized he was just a sacrifice for a business alliance." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia, who was following behind him, sighed, "I never expected that even a big family like yours would have to sacrifice their freedom in marriage for the sake of consolidating family interests." Dylan turned around and looked at her with lowered eyes, "That's what my grandfather's generation went through." Amelia looked up and asked, "But don't you guys need to go through that anymore?" Dylan smiled lightly, "My grandfather said that the Lawrence family has had enough sacrifices with him. His children have the freedom to marry whoever they want." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The first thing Matty did when he took over was to change the outdated customs and rules set by the previous generation. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, the Lawrence family could be considered harmonious and friendly. Hearing Dylan's words, Amelia looked at him with curiosity. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If his family no longer needed business alliances, why was he still looking for them everywhere? Dylan couldn't understand what Amelia was thinking, so he asked tentatively, "Miss Clark, are you married?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia calmly replied, "Before I came, I researched the Lawrence family. Didn't you research me?" The news of Skender's death was kept secret by Aaron. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Including the Clark family and the Brook family, except for a few of Johnny's peers, the elders didn't know that Skender's sister was still alive. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The only other person who knew about Amelia's existence was Jocelyn, who had already felt guilty for ruining Sumasa's appearance and causing the breakup between Skender and Aaron. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had no intention of sharing this information with others and naturally kept it a secret. But Amelia couldn't be sure if the Lawrence family had the ability to dig up what they wanted, surpassing the Evans family, the Johnson family, the Sherwood family, the Clark family, and even the Brook family. So she chose to ask back, in order to not reveal anything. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dylan saw that she was avoiding even this topic and subconsciously smirked, "I never investigate someone's background. It's better to be open and honest when dealing with people." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia, being subtly mocked, smiled and said, "I think it's better to understand things clearly before doing business." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dylan raised an eyebrow, "So... I was just trying to get to know you, but it seems like you're guarded." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia didn't respond and followed him across the lawn, towards the winding path. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dylan remained composed and continued, "I attended a dinner party with Miss Evans before and saw a silhouette that looked a lot like you." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing this, Amelia tensed up. She thought she had escaped when she saw Dylan following Edith and quickly hid in the bathroom, but he still saw her. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia felt a bit nervous inside, but she pretended to be calm on the surface and said, "A silhouette that you remember for so long, seems like she must be a great beauty..." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dylan raised his hand and touched his nose, "I just have a good memory." Amelia forced a smile, "I see..." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at Amelia like this, Dylan's gaze became mysterious and unclear, "Mr. Sherwood was also present at the last dinner party. Did you go but forget?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wanted to dig deeper. After thinking for a moment, Amelia shook her head, "Mr. Sherwood is just my assistant. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Why would I go to his dinner party?" Dylan acted understanding and nodded, no longer questioning Amelia. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead, he looked at Neil thoughtfully and said, "Mr. Sherwood, you must come from a prestigious background as well, right?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Neil, who was struggling with the difficult path, rolled his eyes at the comment, "If I came from a prestigious background, would I be doing this manual labor?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he came from a prestigious background, he would live in the most prosperous area </span><span>of England and have seventeen or eighteen servants to carry things for him, instead of doing it himself! </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dylan smiled and said, "I thought Mr. Sherwood was acquainted with Mr. Evans, so I thought you also came from a prestigious family." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Neil forced a symmetrical smile and replied, "I'm not acquainted with Mr. Evans, I'm acquainted with his wife, I..." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before he could finish his sentence, Amelia elbowed him in the stomach. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Neil winced in pain and quickly changed his words, "Dylan, let's go inside. I can't carry anything anymore." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After giving Amelia a meaningful look, Dylan put away his probing thoughts and opened the door, inviting Neil and Amelia to sit in the living room while he went upstairs to find Matty.</span></p></div>
