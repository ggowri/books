        <h1>Chapter 2003 This Fleeting Life</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The news of Amelia's death shocked Johnny for a long time. Finally, he rushed over to her funeral. When everyone left the cemetery, he stroked her tombstone, reluctant to part.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Amelia."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Supporting himself on her tombstone, Johnny slowly squatted down, his aged eyes fixed upon her name.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you surprised?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Johnny raised his eyebrows and began to talk to himself, "It turns out that I can love someone for so long. I never expected myself to be such a devoted man."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He smiled, "I am so affectionate that I feel no other woman in this world is worthy of my attention. So, Amelia, I am no worse than James, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The only response he received was the fluttering of birds flying over overhead in the cemetery. As the birds and animals dispersed, only silence lingered, akin to Johnny's devotion buried deep within his heart, never daring to be spoken aloud all these years.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His strong affection was hidden, unable to surface. It was after Amelia's passing that he found the courage to confess that he, too, had loved her deeply, standing in front of her grave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone harbored regrets. Johnny's was that Amelia never knew, until her demise, that there existed a fool in this world who held onto the crush of the past and silently guarded her from thousands of miles away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wondered, "But so what? She won't be aware of it. Johnny, what are you obsessed with?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After sitting in front of Amelia's tombstone for a long time, he stood up and departed with the realization that the answer he sought remained elusive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Johnny's primary concern was not a romantic relationship but his career, to which he had dedicated his whole attention, steering the Brook family to ascend as the largest and most influential family in the world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was a legendary figure in the business world. Even decades later, people still talked about Johnny, who never married in his life, and wondered what kind of person he was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ryan, far away in Imperial Capital, was the last to receive the news. He sat at his desk, staring at Edith's message, and fell silent for a moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon learning of James' death, Ryan had anticipated such an outcome. He also understood that if it hadn't been for Alexander, Amelia would have died with James on the spot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Becoming a mother meant relinquishing the freedom she once enjoyed in her youth. Yet, paradoxically, it was this very responsibility that gave Amelia the strength to persevere for a few more years.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ryan slowly put down his phone and stood up. With the desk as support, he staggered to the bathroom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Remaining out of touch for the past twenty years had been Ryan's greatest compromise, yet it also served as a shackle, hindering him from truly living.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had never recovered from depression and had been struggling for more than twenty years. However, he didn't dare to die, fearing that Amelia would feel guilty. Now that she passed away, he could be free.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before the end, he yearned to see her once more. Just as he had appeared decently in his youth, his last moment should be with integrity as well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon completing his bath, Ryan dressed himself and straightened the collar of his white shirt. With the comb from the sink, he smoothed his grey hair backward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The night when Amelia's hair turned grey overnight because of James, Ryan's hair also underwent the same change. He couldn't discern whether it was due to longing or worry. All he knew was that her passing implied his.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He washed up and went to Amelia's tombstone. As ever, while touching it, he expressed his inner thoughts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ryan said, "Amelia, the biggest remorse in my life is my memory loss. If it hadn't happened, I wouldn't have lost you. However, in that scenario, you wouldn't have encountered James, who cherished you deeply. Consequently, another regret would have arisen between you both."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He smiled, "Should I satisfy you or myself? It took me many, many years to realize that it would be better to please you. After all, how could someone like me deserve your love?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Prior to losing his memory, Ryan had grabbed Amelia by the neck and asked her why she had betrayed him.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If his affection for her was genuine, how could he inflict pain upon her when he knew she was attempting to rescue him? His ability to utter such cruel words suggested that his love for her might not have been incredibly profound.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Believing that he had not adored Amelia enough, Ryan pulled a gun from his waist and pointed it at his temple. Tears gradually welled up in his eyes, which were fixed on her name.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This belated farewell is what I have desired to do most in the past few decades. Now, I can finally do it. Please forgive me, and...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Rest assured. I won't bother you in heaven or the next life. I won't see you, either. I hope you and James will meet in the next life and cherish each other as much as you did in this one."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as Ryan finished speaking, a gunshot rang out across the sky, scaring away the birds in the forest, as if putting an end to all the love, hatred, and grudges.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Afterward, he fell to the ground. There were regrets, but they faded with this fleeting life.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the end, James perished in the snowy mountains. Devastated by his loss, Amelia succumbed to depression and passed away. Ryan, honoring his youthful promise, committed suicide for love once again. This time, no one saved him. The story of the three of them concluded with the echo of gunfire. From then on, James, Amelia, and Ryan ceased to exist in this world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The end.</span></p></div>
