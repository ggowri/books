        <h1>Chapter 1962 No More Connection Soon</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Edith thought about it carefully. Maybe it was because she saw Jackson's deep devotion to Amelia. Even though he couldn't bear to live, he endured all the pain of treatment, cooperated with the doctor, and tried to get up from his wheelchair because Amelia wanted to see him stand up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If someone else had severe depression, they would have died long ago. However, to relieve Amelia's guilt, Jackson had been living with forbearance. Even though he would have been in so much pain that he would commit suicide many times in the middle of the night, he would remind himself to live when he woke up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Edith felt that such a man was devoted and precious, so she fell in love with him unconsciously. However, she never thought about whether she liked Jackson or wanted to have such a pure relationship.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While she was passionately in love with Jackson, Anthony also silently watched how Edith gradually fell in love with someone else.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It rained tonight. The man who lived in the building opposite opened the curtains. Through the windows where the rain was dribbling down, he looked at Edith, who was sitting before the floor-to-ceiling window, eating spaghetti alone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Afraid that Edith would find him, he dared not turn on the light. So, at this moment, he was like a mouse in the dark with no one to save him. He could only hide in the darkness and secretly watch her every move. He knew what he was doing was sick, but it was the only way to stay with her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony actually loved Edith very much. He loved her so much that he couldn't sleep or eat and even got stomach cancer. However, he still wanted to spend the remaining time with Edith. Even if Edith didn't know, he would protect her quietly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After finishing her meal, Edith sat before the floor-to-ceiling window for a while, then got up and went back to her room. The lights in the living room dimmed, and Anthony could not see anything clearly. He stood quietly for a long time, turned on the light, and sat in the living room, waiting for Edith to wake up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It took Edith a little pain to get over Jackson, but it was much better than when she let go of Anthony. Now, she just slept for two or three months. When she woke up, her feelings for Jackson faded much more. This was the self-control that an adult possessed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Edith turned her attention from Jackson back to the studio. She began to work on the craft exhibition. During one of the exhibits, a newcomer plagiarized her work and accused her of plagiarism.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Edith had no choice but to hire a lawyer for a lawsuit. She deliberately avoided Anthony's law firm, but she didn't know what was going on in the legal world. Every lawyer refused to take her case. When she was upset, Anthony knocked on the door of her studio.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Anthony's thin and pale face, Edith frowned subconsciously, "Didn't we agree not to see each other anymore? What are you doing here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony, who was already in the late stage of his cancer, willed himself to walk into her office. He took out a business card from his suit pocket and handed it to her. "Ms. Evans, I heard that you would pay high legal fees. Of course, I'm here to recommend myself."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Edith glanced at his business card and rested her indifferent gaze on Anthony's face. "Mr. Clark, you should not need my legal fees, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony put the business card on the table, then stretched out his skinny fingers and pushed it before Edith. "Ms. Evans, anyway, no lawyer will take your case. Why don't you let go of the past enmity and try to accept me again?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Edith knew his implication but pretended not to understand and rejected him coldly. "Mr. Clark, there is no enmity between us."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every time Anthony heard Edith call him Mr. Clark, his heart ached. The girl back then would have been miserable without him, and now, Edith would be happy without him. He never knew he would be so heartbroken when she stopped loving him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fortunately, he had cancer and would soon be free from such pain and leave peacefully. But before leaving, he couldn't bear to see Edith, who loved him so dearly, being bullied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Enduring the pain, Anthony forced a smile and said, "There must be some grudges, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yes. But Edith had nothing to say and remained silent. Anthony couldn't take the pain anymore. He sat down on the chair opposite the desk and looked at her again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Edith, I've always been sure about winning the cases. Believe me. I can definitely sue the person who plagiarized your work until he goes bankrupt."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I trust you, but I don't want to have anything to do with you anymore."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her words were blunt yet hurtful, like a knife stabbing into Anthony's heart. Every time she said it, it cut a deep hole in his heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked at Edith's clean and pretty face for a long while, then slowly lowered his eyes and rested his sad gaze on his palm that he had difficulty even raising.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Soon, you will no longer have anything to do with me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His voice was so soft that Edith didn't hear it. "What did you say?" she asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony closed his palms, lifted his eyes, and smiled at Edith, "After I help you with the lawsuit, I won't come to you again, and we won't have any connection anymore."</span></p></div>
