        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James put on his gloves and looked at the members waiting by the helicopter. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Three things." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"First, protect your own lives." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Second, stop after killing 49 members." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Third, leave the member who killed Zack to me." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James's concise voice echoed, followed by a deafening response. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes!" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James withdrew his gaze and looked at Holden and Emelyn. "I'll go first, you follow." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Or should we go first?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The number of explosives arranged by Erebus was unknown, and the first group of people was the most dangerous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James didn't pay attention to Holden's </span><span>concern,</span><span> he walked quickly past them and came to a black business car. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Paul, is the detonation delay system activated?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul, sitting in the car full of high-tech electronic devices, tapped the keyboard quickly without looking up. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"One second." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright." P</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>aul stopped his fingers and looked up with a smile in his eyes, looking at James. "James, with me here, no one is your match." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James nodded slightly and turned around to face Andrew, extending his hand. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Andrew immediately took out a handgun and placed it in James's palm. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James closed his hand, gripping the gun tightly, and walked towards the helicopter. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just before boarding, a clear voice came from behind. "James, take me with you." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James stopped and half-turned his tall figure, looking into the distance where Johnny was being aimed at by countless guns. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as Johnny appeared, the members of S pulled out their guns and aimed at his head. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Johnny made any move, one of the countless bullets would make him fall. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Facing so many guns, Johnny remained calm and raised his finger, gently pushing it aside. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I also have an obligation to eliminate Erebus. How about we cooperate?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James didn't respond, he just turned his head slightly and looked at Johnny. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His cold eyes seemed to ask: What are you doing here while I'm going to save my wife? </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Johnny felt embarrassed being seen through by James, but he still came uncontrollably. "I have quite a few people. Think about it." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James stared at Johnny for a few seconds, then continued walking without saying a word. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He took the walkie-talkie handed to him by the pilot and looked at Johnny through the window. "You're in charge of the rear." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After James boarded the helicopter, he raised his chin and his cold and indifferent voice came through the walkie-talkie. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The first 25 members, get ready." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as the command was received, the members immediately threw the explosives. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the moment they were thrown, deafening explosions echoed through the mountains. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James didn't even blink his eyes and continued giving orders. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The second group, 35 members, follow." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Holden and Emelyn immediately boarded the helicopter and quickly headed towards Erebus. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Johnny, who was monitoring with binoculars, saw the magnificent scene in the sky and couldn't help but feel respect. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All the explosives around Erebus were destroyed. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a thorough check, hundreds of helicopters descended upon the four major areas of Erebus. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matty, sitting in the control room, saw this scene and felt a tingling sensation on his scalp. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But it was only for a moment, and he quickly regained his composure, opened the authorization, and contacted Carson. "It's your turn." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carson, waiting on the ship, received the order and put down his binoculars, waving his hand. "Go to the island." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James encountered Carson as soon as he got off the helicopter. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two stood facing each other across the burning mountains, separated by trees. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Holden, who had overheard their conversation outside the door last night, glanced at James and then at Carson. "Mr. Clark, are you going to kill even your own nephew?" Carson thought Holden was referring to Johnny and didn't pay much attention, raising an eyebrow. "I won't kill him, but teaching him a lesson is necessary." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Holden followed Carson's gaze and looked at Johnny, who was studying an AK rifle with his head down. "I'm not talking about him." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Holden looked at the leader, James. "I'm talking about him."</span></p></div>
