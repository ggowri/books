        <h1>Chapter 1985 Solve the Trouble</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander followed James back into the car and happened to see Amelia. He instinctively froze for a moment. "Mom, why did you come, too?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She hadn't seen Alexander for a long time. As Amelia saw her son, she felt like crying. "We wanted to secretly visit you, but we didn't expect to encounter something wrong with you..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing the shoe prints on Alexander's face, she felt even more heartbroken. She reached out to touch his face but was afraid that Alexander wouldn't get used to it, so her hand suddenly froze in the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing her cautious appearance, he was no longer like he used to be. Instead, he grabbed Amelia's hand and placed it on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Touching Alexander's emaciated face, she could not control it and hugged him, who was wet and drenched. "If I knew you would be bullied abroad, I wouldn't let you go abroad five years ago..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander, who had already grown into a teenager, reached out a palm larger than Amelia's hand and placed it on her back, gently patting her. "This kind of accident only happened once and happened to be caught up by you. I usually bully others."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She saw it with her own eyes and didn't believe Alexander's comforting words. Amelia only felt sorry for him and carefully examined his body. "Have you hurt?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He shook his head. "I have good skills and resisted several attacks. It was only then that my father came to save me..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Speaking that, Alexander looked admiringly at James, who was sitting in the front row and wiping his hair with a towel. "Father, you just saved me like a hero."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He smiled and took the towel Andrew handed him, then threw it into his hand. "You're no longer a little boy. If you encounter something and wait for me to come and save you, what will you do if I'm not here in the future?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander, who took the towel and casually wiped his hair, rarely showed a confident smile. "My father is so powerful and imposing, so how could you not be here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James had a gloomy expression, Amelia did the same, and Andrew remained silent. The sudden calmness in the car made Alexander lift his head in confusion. "Why are you all silent?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James gestured for Amelia in the rearview mirror. She suppressed the dull pain in her heart and reached out to take the towel from Alexander's hand, gently wiping his hair. "Do you know who bullied you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander, whose attention was diverted, enjoyed her tenderness while nodding. "I know. Those people always use secret tricks."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James and Andrew exchanged a glance, and then Andrew immediately said, "Mr. Alexander Evans, tomorrow you should accompany your parents for a good stroll."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He obediently responded, "I originally planned to spend more time with my parents until graduation and return home. Since they have come to see me, I naturally want to make time for them."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next day, Andrew, who suggested Alexander stay with his parents, brought Peter to the dean's office. They didn't use coercion or inducement but just presented evidence captured on camera and demanded the dean, Nathan Edwards, expel those bad students from their studies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At first, he was unwilling, so Andrew took a document and placed it on his desk. Nathan glanced at the documents and expelled those students on the same day after receiving a huge donation from the Evans family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander, sitting on the deck of the ship and enjoying a luxurious meal, was still unaware of what had happened at school. He was just immersed, enjoying the feeling of being pampered by his parents.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander rarely used his phone, but as dusk approached, he took out the phone and faced the sunset to take photos of himself and his parents. Alexander changed the photo to his phone wallpaper, probably to remember this beautiful and brief time forever.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He still had to continue his studies, so Amelia and James did not disturb him excessively. Spending a day with him, they sent him back to school.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander would only be able to graduate and return home in the second half of this year. However, in order to return early, he spent all day doing research in the laboratory. He led the team to complete projects one by one and ended his studies two months ahead of schedule.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he returned home, he happened to catch Grace's wedding. After Phil's continuous pursuit and repentance for five years, Grace finally agreed to his proposal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their relationship could have gone smoothly, but Phil woke up too late. Going their separate ways in high school, he realized that without Grace by his side, he would always miss her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, she resented Phil changing his school preferences. Entering college, Grace deleted Phil's contact information. Later on, she met many suitors and chose the most outstanding man from them, Vincent Hall, to have a romantic relationship.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Learning about it, Phil flew back to Arcadia overnight and headed to Arcadia University, only to see a couple embracing each other warmly in the winter. Recognizing Grace, he broke down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His upbringing prevented him from disturbing the beloved couple, but he still uncontrollably took out his phone and called Grace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grace, who was disturbed by the phone call, saw the caller ID. She didn't even think about it and pressed the disconnect button.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Phil was unwilling and frantically called her. Grace gritted her teeth, released Vincent, and answered it, "Why do you call me every day? You're so annoying!"</span></p></div>
