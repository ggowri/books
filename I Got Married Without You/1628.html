        <h1>Chapter 1628 Sober</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two of them had a wild night and then slept deeply for a whole day. When they woke up, it was already dusk.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva, feeling the effects of the alcohol wearing off, held her pounding headache and tried to call out to Mandy. But her lips accidentally brushed against the hard chest of a man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Startled, Eva lifted her head and saw a handsome face. Once she recognized who it was, her heart skipped a beat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, the evening glow filtered through the window, casting a faint red light on Paul's smooth and fair skin. With his eyes closed, he looked like a sweet little angel on earth, so innocent that it made one blush and feel a flutter in their heart...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva's gaze traced down his face, revealing his well-defined abs, followed by his long legs...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both of them were naked. His slender and heavy hand was still wrapped around her waist, and his legs were between hers...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva raised her right hand to cover her eyes and swiftly removed his hand from her waist with her other hand. She deftly lifted the blanket and rolled off the bed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as her feet touched the ground, she grabbed a nearby towel and quickly wrapped herself up. Then, she turned to look at the peacefully sleeping Paul...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't a dream. She had actually slept with Paul last night, more than once. She couldn't remember how many times, but she could feel the pain in her lower body, as if it had been run over by a car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Recalling those deadly and crazy moments, she blushed instinctively and rushed into the bathroom, turning on the faucet and burying her head in the water...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The cold water calmed her down. Eva raised her hand and slapped herself. She blamed herself for drinking and causing this mess!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She lifted her face, now covered in water droplets, and looked at herself in the mirror. Her neck and below were covered in bruises and marks. It was evident how intense their night had been...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although her body was marked with signs of passion, her face was glowing with radiance. It had to be said that even her skin had improved after being moisturized by a man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as this thought crossed her mind, she slapped herself again. What was she thinking? How could she have such wicked thoughts?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva leaned on the sink, clenched her fists, and angrily struck the sink, while blaming herself. Paul observed everything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's wrong? Do you regret it?" Paul's voice made Eva instinctively turn around, only to see Paul still standing there, completely naked...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She quickly closed her eyes and took a deep breath. "Put on some clothes."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul, with his arms crossed and leaning against the door, lowered his gaze to the clothes at Eva's feet. "Do you think I can still wear that outfit?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva finally opened her eyes and looked down at the white shirt and suit pants on the floor. She slowly remembered how she had vomited all over Paul last night. So, she vomited on him first, then he took off his clothes, and they ended up on the bed?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva couldn't recall the specific details, but she extended her finger and picked up the towel from the side. Without looking back, she threw it at Paul in a parabolic trajectory.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll have Mandy buy you a new outfit. For now, wrap yourself up with the towel."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul caught the towel accurately and glanced at Eva's graceful figure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's not like I haven't seen it before. What are you afraid of?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He acted tough, but his hand obediently unfolded the towel and wrapped it around his lower body.</span></p></div>
