        <h1>Chapter 1995 His Impending Demise</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Standing amidst the snow, James weakly raised his fingers and waved at Paul with his remaining strength. Unable to bear it any longer, Paul gritted his teeth and swiftly descended the snow mountain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"James, I'm going to call the doctor before sending the robot up the mountain. After that, I'll come to find you. You must stay where you are and wait for me. I'll be back soon!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>During the night, the road was unpredictable, yet the white snow all over the sky illuminated the way back, giving Paul the sensation of walking in daylight. Rushing and disoriented, he repeatedly stumbled and knelt in the snow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Paul faded away from view, James covered his chest, where his heartbeat gradually slowed, and stood there, quietly experiencing the anguish of losing his life.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a long while, when Amelia stepped out to search for him and called his name, James looked back through the dense trees and spotted her wandering in the snow with an umbrella.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His glance was full of affection. Meanwhile, the clock seemed to turn back to their first encounter. However, now, the sun was gone, leaving only snow and mist in its place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"James!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia went back and waited for a while. Sensing that something was wrong, she opened the door of the house across from the villa. As expected, James was nowhere to be seen. Perplexed, she scanned the area, scouring every corner for any sign of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James desired to say, "I'm here." Yet, with blood streaming from all his features, he couldn't reply as clearly and powerfully as before, "Amelia, I'm here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, struggling to open his eyes, which were almost blurry, he pivoted around and staggered toward the deep mountains.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The forest was thick with trees, and despite the snow lighting up the night sky, it was challenging to spot any signs of people, making it an ideal place to conceal a body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James believed that the snow encasing his body would deter wild animals from gnawing at his body. In this manner, being buried beneath the snow-covered mountain for an extended period would safeguard his visage from decay.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Many years later, if Amelia were to discover that the robot was a fake and, by chance, Paul managed to locate him, she wouldn't be frightened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, Amelia mentioned that she was attracted to James because of his good looks, leading her to fall in love with him. Even in death, he could not destroy her impression of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James clung to a tree and felt the chip moving within his brain amidst the surging blood. As each nerve was severed, blood spurted from his features. Finally, a mouthful of blood gushed out of his mouth, foretelling his impending demise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He paused there for only two seconds before his tall and upright figure, as if he had lost his soul, knelt on the ground with a bang, assuming a posture akin to that of a broken puppet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite having lost all hope of survival, he held on to his last vestige of strength, gazing up slowly at the snowflakes resembling silver frost swirling gracefully across the sky.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The snowflakes fell one by one, landing on his eyelashes, nose, and cheeks...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With snow as his companion, James exuded a unique charm, his peerless handsomeness untouched by anything in this world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Glancing up through the snowflakes, he noticed that Amelia, holding a transparent umbrella, approached him and appeared to ask, "Hey, why are you covered in blood?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't hear clearly or was in a trance. So, he could only raise his head and draw nearer to her. When his thin lips were about to touch her red ones, she took a step back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The snowfall transformed into a storm in an instant. Amelia tugged at his trouser legs and begged him with tears, "Sir, one million dollars a night. Please buy me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under the umbrella, James slowly looked down at the petite figure soaked by the rain, which instantly ignited his desire to possess her. He asked, "One night is not enough. What about a lifetime?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James shook his head in denial of the scene. At that time, he asked if Amelia was pure instead of expecting her to be with him for the rest of her life. So, it dawned on him that what he had witnessed was an illusion and that she did not come to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He let out a long sigh of relief. Soon, he relaxed his exhausted body and sank into the snow, allowing the flakes to settle upon him and gradually cover him entirely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before his deep eyes were about to close, James faced the moonless night sky and said with difficulty, "Amelia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In this life, I have temporarily let you down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I hope I can be your husband again in the next life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then, we will always be together, aging alongside each other over time.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Besides, in my eyes, everything in the world pales in comparison with you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If one day you find me, please don't blame me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Breaking my promise to leave you makes me feel powerless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Finally, I love you as deeply as the stars enamored with the radiant night sky, as the waves captivated by the expansive beach, as the crystal accompanying the morning dew, and as the sunset followed by the afterglow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even in death, my affection for you is akin to the lingering yet untraceable wind, the profound and distant river, and the starry sky, which is engraved in my heart and etched into my soul and shall never fade away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Amelia, I will wait for you for twenty years in heaven. See you in the next life."</span></p></div>
