        <h1>Chapter 1801 Amelia questioned Dylan</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carson couldn't understand it either, he just knew that he was feeling quite stable emotionally at the moment, and he could still rationally advise Matty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, under James' leadership, the S organization is not indiscriminately killing, and they are not seeking personal revenge. At most, they are just eliminating the cancerous elements in the business world. Sometimes we also intentionally target these cancerous elements, so I think we should just let it go."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's impossible!" Matty's hatred for the S organization was much greater than Carson's, so how could he just let it go so easily?!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Lawrence..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you try to persuade me again, don't blame me for being impolite."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carson fell silent. According to Erebus' rules, after joining Erebus, if you encounter members of the S organization, you must not speak up for them, otherwise you will be sent to the biochemical area.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, I won't persuade you to let him go, but I advise you to consider other options," Carson said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matty glanced at him with a look that made Carson swallow the words he was about to say, especially the part about telling James that Amelia was still alive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matty saw the killing intent in Carson's eyes. He had come alone and couldn't beat Matty, so he wisely decided to avoid a confrontation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll be leaving </span><span>now,</span><span> I still have some unfinished business."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Carson got up to leave, Matty called him back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Next, I want to bring Amelia back to the Lawrence family. As for Erebus and what happened to James, don't tell Amelia."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carson understood. If Amelia found out that Matty was the founder of Erebus and treated James the way he did, her impression of him would be extremely negative, and she might even hate him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carson also wanted to continue being Amelia's uncle, so he would listen to Matty. "Alright, I'll keep my mouth shut, I'll pretend I don't know anything, you can do whatever you want."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Carson left the room, Matty considered whether to make Carson the 1-2 and give him the authority to manage Erebus. However, although Carson was ruthless, he wasn't ruthless enough, and Matty feared that entrusting him with the task would only make matters worse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Forget it, he thought, I'll clean up the mess at Erebus after I've settled my personal matters.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With this in mind, after Dylan saw Carson off, Matty called him back to the study.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He instructed Dylan not to reveal anything about his past with Sophia, and to say that Sophia sent the child away out of anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dylan was unaware of Matty's conversation with Carson and agreed to keep the secret. He then took the report and went to see Amelia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this time, Paul had taken Eva home to rest, and Johnny had gone to change his medication. There was no one else in the hospital room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before entering the room, Dylan knocked on the door. "Amelia, the test results are out. I've come to show them to you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia nodded. "Please come in."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After receiving permission, Dylan entered and handed the report to Amelia. "Just as my grandfather suspected, you are indeed a member of the Lawrence family."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon receiving the report, Amelia heard what Dylan said and knew what the report contained. "</span><span>So</span><span> my mother really was Mr. Lawrence's child."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she stared at the report, she sighed inwardly. Families like the Lawrence family were never short of money, yet </span><span>Sumasa</span><span> had starved and frozen to death. She had found her way back to her family, but she didn't feel any joy. She looked up and asked Dylan, "Can you tell me why my mother was abandoned?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In Amelia's understanding, it was abandonment that had led to </span><span>Sumasa's</span><span> tragic life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dylan, following his grandfather's instructions, replied, "It was that Sophia who sent the child away out of anger and deliberately kept it from him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia was taken aback. "Is Sophia really that hot-tempered?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dylan laughed. "Yes, she is. My grandfather was even afraid of her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia still couldn't understand. "Is it possible that Sophia would send the child away just out of anger? It doesn't make sense."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She meant that the reason wasn't convincing enough. Dylan replied, "Yes, she wasn't just angry. It was probably because my grandfather was planning a business alliance, and she used this method to get back at him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia tilted her head, questioning Dylan. "But... a woman who is willing to have a child for a man is very much in love with him. How could she use this method to get back at him?"</span></p></div>
