        <h1>Chapter 1911 The Baby Looks Like Them</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James found the top obstetricians and gynecologists to reassess Amelia's health, mainly to see if they could save both her and the baby. After the doctors finished their assessment, the results they gave were the same as the hospital director's.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He reached out to the heads of other hospitals, sending them the report. After reviewing it, they too said that performing a cesarean section on a patient with preeclampsia could easily lead to severe bleeding, heart failure, or even a brain hemorrhage. Given that Amelia had undergone a heart transplant, her survival was truly unpredictable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They teamed up and found a renowned expert, recommending him to James. After meeting James, the expert promised to work with the dean and do everything possible to increase the chances from 30% to 40%.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even such authoritative experts dared not make guarantees, indicating that the surgery carried a huge risk. But the child was already on the way, there was no other choice. They could only opt for a 30% or 40% chance, otherwise, it was just waiting for the inevitable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James refused to accept his fate. He demanded the doctors ensure the surgery was foolproof, threatening that if anything went wrong, they would go down with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James' words were incredibly oppressive, adding a lot of pressure to the doctors. They had no choice but to hold another assessment meeting before the surgery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dr. Tenny, for this surgery, you're the lead surgeon. I hope you can find a way to save the child's life during the extraction process. I'll have another doctor on standby, ready to step in and provide immediate resuscitation if needed."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dr. Gilbert, the pregnant woman's current condition is critical. If we proceed with the first incision, there's a high risk of severe bleeding. All I can do is to quickly stop the bleeding and save her. However, I can't guarantee that the child won't suffocate due to the prolonged rescue process."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Enough has been said. For now, let's not worry about whether the child will survive. Let's focus on saving the pregnant woman's life first."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inside the obstetrics conference room, the sound of two experts engaged in a heated debate could be heard. Amelia, sitting outside, felt a heartache so intense it was as if her heart was bleeding upon hearing their words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The baby, over seven months old and still moving in her belly, had to be taken out early due to her physical condition. There was even no guarantee that the baby would survive the extraction process.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A pair of eyes, filled with despair and confusion, stared out into the hallway of the maternity ward. They watched the pregnant women, hands on their bellies, faces lit up with joyous smiles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia initially thought that once she had managed to conceive, she would, like other </span><span>pregnant women, give birth smoothly. Who would have thought that this was just a delusion for her?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man who was always by Amelia's side saw her looking at the other pregnant women with envy. He was afraid she might waver again, so he quickly reached out with his slender fingers and wrapped his arm around her waist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Amelia, even without this child, we still have Grace. From now on, let's consider her as our daughter. Having her by our side is just the same."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia thought so too. They still had Grace. Since she wasn't destined to be with this child, she should just let it go. There was no point in forcing it. After all, how would James survive without her? For James' sake, Amelia ultimately decided to stay firm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"When does the doctor decide to perform a cesarean section?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"One week later."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Can I go back first?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wanted to go back to the baby's room, to let the baby experience the room she had carefully designed and warmly decorated. That way, even if the baby never had the chance to see it again, there wouldn't be such a sense of regret.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright." After responding, James held Amelia tighter, lowered his head, and kissed her on the top of her head. "I'll take you home to stay for the night, and we'll come back to the hospital tomorrow."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man, fearing unforeseen circumstances, brought a few doctors with him and returned to Blue Bay Island. As soon as Amelia got out of the car, she went to the bedroom next to Grace's.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Pushed open the door to the baby's room, what came into view was a warm-toned decor. There was a tiny baby basket nestled next to a pink princess bed, and not far away, a wardrobe filled with all sorts of baby clothes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia stepped on the soft pink carpet, walking over to the wardrobe. She opened the door and pulled out a tiny outfit, holding it in her palm and imagining. She wondered, what would her baby look like in this little outfit?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The girl would surely look like her, with big eyes like grapes, a delicate nose, and cherry-pink lips. Dressed in such tiny clothes, she would undoubtedly be incredibly adorable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it was a boy, he must have been like James, with eyes like melting snow in winter, and a high nose bridge, he must have been incredibly handsome...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The more Amelia thought about it, the more she couldn't bear to part with her child. Tears welled up in her eyes, rolling down like a flood that couldn't be stopped. Before long, her tears had soaked her clothes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She clutched her clothes, sitting on the small sofa, staring at the warmth filling the room. Suddenly, she fell into a cold despair. The two options, the baby and James kept pricking her nerves...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the end, she lifted her hand, covering her face, crying until she lost her voice. If she could, she really wanted to give up herself, to let the baby live. But James...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Choosing between her husband and child was an incredibly difficult decision for Amelia. It was only natural for her to waver back and forth. However, as a pregnant mother, her desire to ensure her baby's survival was even stronger...</span></p></div>
