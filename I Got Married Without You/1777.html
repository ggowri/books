        <h1>Chapter 1777 Carson got the controller</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Venom's time in solitary confinement was up, and he was quickly released. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as he got out, he gathered his men and kicked the door open while Emily and Mr. Ben were making love in the room. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Several men in black rushed in and dragged the two naked individuals off the bed. Wearing a mask, Venom saw Emily and kicked her over. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emily, who was completely naked, was furious, her face turning pale and trembling all over. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were caught off guard and pinned to the ground by the men in black, unable to move. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emily could only raise her head, grit her teeth, and glare at Venom. "Venom, are you not afraid of 1-2 coming after you for treating me like this?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Afraid? Yes." Venom casually replied as he scraped his shoe on the carpet. "I'm very afraid." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you're afraid, then why don't you let us go?!" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Venom sneered and waved his hand without bothering to say anything. "Throw them into the snake pit!" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emily couldn't believe it, staring at Venom with wide eyes. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ben and I are 1-2's right-hand men, you dare!" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't dare." Venom sneered and nodded to his men. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The men holding Emily and Mr. Ben quickly grabbed them and headed out. They didn't even give Emily any clothes, just </span><span>pressed</span><span> her naked body and quickly headed to the elevator. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Mr. Ben broke free from the men holding him and rushed to Emily, he grabbed her wrist with one hand and dealt with the men swarming them with the other. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mr. Ben had received training from S since he was young, and he was quite skilled. In </span><span>the time it took for Venom to pull out his gun, Mr. Ben dragged Emily and pushed her into the exclusive escape route. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"1-2 gave you permission, go!" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emily quickly scanned her iris, and the door instantly opened. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She quickly slipped inside and, as she tried to pull Mr. Ben in with her, Venom shot him! </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mr. Ben took a bullet but stood his ground, blocking all the men in black at the entrance to the passage. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the door closed, Emily hesitated for a moment, seemingly surprised that Mr. Ben was willing to sacrifice himself for her. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Venom aimed at Emily's forehead, but the bullet hit the door like a solid wall. He cursed and walked over to Mr. Ben, who was already on the ground clutching his chest. Without any hesitation, he aimed at his head and fired. In a fit of rage, he fired several shots, then threw away the gun and stepped over Mr. Ben's body. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Throw him into the snake pit!" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes!" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The men in black quickly went to work, while Venom returned to the room and retrieved a controller, then went to the solitary confinement room. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't care whether Emily had gone to the upper area to report to 1-2, as he took advantage of the moment to open the door to the solitary confinement room. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I threw Mr. Ben into the snake pit, avenging your friend Zack. As for Emily..." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She escaped through 1-2's exclusive passage. She has permission, I don't. I can't catch her for now." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carson quickly explained, then threw the controller, covered in blood, to James. "I got this back for you. You figure out what to do with it." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying that, Carson turned to leave, but James suddenly raised his cold, sinister eyes. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I need to borrow your program room."</span></p></div>
