        <h1>Chapter 1915 God didn’t give them the chance</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James, who was being held, suddenly let go of all his temper and buried his sharp face deeply in Amelia's neck, as if they were about to part ways.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He used all his strength to hold the woman in his arms.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't say anything, just silently held her. Outside the car window, it started to rain.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The raindrops hit the window, and soon the glass became foggy.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man, who hadn't slept well for a week, stared at the falling rain with his bloodshot eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He weakly curled his lips, and the despair in his heart was like the rain blocking his way, making it impossible to see the direction...</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They chose 10% over 30%, so they could save the child.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, in the afternoon, while James was driving back to the blue bay island, Amelia suddenly started bleeding...</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't until Amelia felt dizzy and couldn't see the traffic lights outside the window that she realized something was wrong.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She lowered her head and saw a large pool of blood...</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When she reached out to grab James, her vision suddenly went black, and she fell forward...</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Amelia!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James could still hear Amelia's voice, full of anxiety and fear, but Amelia couldn't say anything.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't even have time to say, "James, I love you very much." In an instant, she lost consciousness...</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James turned pale with fear. He held the unconscious Amelia with one hand and grabbed the steering wheel with the other, speeding back to the hospital.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dr. Gilbert hadn't received the order to cancel the operation from Mr. Evans, so he stayed in the operating room, waiting for the two to return.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It didn't take long before he saw the drenched Mr. Evans, soaked in rain, rushing into the hospital while holding the woman whose surgical gown was stained with blood.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What are you standing there for? Hurry up and save her!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing Mr. Evans' angry shout, Dr. Gilbert quickly regained his senses and gathered everyone to go to the operating room.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He himself led the way, trying to take Amelia from Mr. Evans, but the man quickly avoided him and ran straight to the operating room with her in his arms.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he placed Amelia on the operating table, he relaxed his tense body for a moment.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then a chill rose from the soles of his feet, making him shiver uncontrollably and unable to stand steady.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could only support himself by holding onto the operating table, bending over to look at Amelia's face, which was gradually losing color due to the loss of blood.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If the doctors hadn't come in to stop the bleeding, James would have exploded in anger again.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, seeing them busy, he sat down in a chair next to the operating table, still staring at Amelia with despair in his eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Dr. Tenny and Dr. Gilbert quickly washed their hands, they walked into the operating room with their hands raised.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then four nurses came forward and put on gloves. The two doctors, dressed in sterile surgical gowns, quickly stood on the operating table.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dr. Tenny, who was about to make the first incision, reached out his hand to take the hemostatic tools from the other doctors and quickly stopped the bleeding. Then he brought Amelia back from unconsciousness.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Amelia's heartbeat return to normal on the monitor, Dr. Tenny looked at the drenched James and said, "Mr. Evans, given Mrs. Evans' current condition, we must perform abortion immediately, otherwise the baby in her womb will threaten her life."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In other words, fate cannot be defied.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though they had decided to sacrifice themselves and choose the baby, God did not give them that opportunity.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James didn't care whether it could be defied or not. He just wanted Amelia to survive. "With her current condition, does she have a 30% chance of survival?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dr. Tenny, holding the surgical knife, looked at Amelia, who was not unconscious but in a deep sleep, and said, "All I can say is that I will do my best."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The doctors couldn't give any guarantees, and James's heart sank to the bottom. "Regardless, you must save her life. That's my only request."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dr. Tenny and Dr. Gilbert glanced at each other and nodded under the pressure. "Mr. Evans, you should leave for now. You're all wet and it's not suitable for you to stay in the sterile operating room."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it weren't for the fear of infecting Amelia, James would definitely stay here and feel her pain. But now...</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James had no choice but to leave. He forced himself to stand up, then leaned over the operating table and kissed Amelia's forehead. "Darling, be strong. I'm waiting for you to come home. Remember, come home."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying that, the man controlled his reluctance and fear, turned around, and left the operating room.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the moment the door closed, James saw that Amelia's body was covered in bright red blood, so strikingly red that it made his eyes ache...</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James, who was sitting outside like a puppet, had no idea what was happening inside the operating room. He just sat there, motionless.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The whole world became quiet, and there was only the operating room with its red light and the lonely corridor with its cold, icy lights shining on the man, emitting a desolate and cold glow.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Time passed, and James didn't know how long had gone by.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The door of the operating room opened, and a doctor walked out. "Mr. Evans, the baby has been delivered, but the mother is experiencing severe bleeding that can't be stopped. It's unlikely she will make it..."</span></p></div>
