        <h1>Chapter 1818 Sophia’s grave</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing the things in her hand, Amelia looked up at her eldest uncle Bruce, who was driving, and her second uncle River, who was sitting in the passenger seat. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both of them were looking at her through the rearview mirror.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't you like to eat them?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia shook her head. She didn't used to like these things, but now that she was pregnant, she was quite addicted to these sour foods.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After thanking them, she opened the snack bag, took out a plum, and put it in her mouth. The sour taste quickly dispelled the stuffy feeling in the car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing her eating quietly, River couldn't help but curl his lips. If his younger sister were still here, this would probably be her appearance, right?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We didn't know about your existence before. If we had known, without your grandfather's help, your eldest uncle and I would have been the first to bring you home."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia pinched the bag in her hand, but still didn't say anything. It wasn't that she didn't want to speak, but she didn't know what to say.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>River seemed to understand her shyness. After saying this, he sat up straight and looked ahead, not wanting to disturb her further.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sitting next to her, Matty looked at his two sons for a moment, and then at the snacks in Amelia's hand. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After thinking for a while, he took out a box of biscuits from the nearby box and handed it to Amelia, imitating the actions of his two sons.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The journey is a bit long. If you get hungry, you can have some of these."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia stared at the box of biscuits, frowning slightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's too dry. I can't swallow it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matty felt a bit embarrassed and took back the biscuits, then took out a bottle of water.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then have some water."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia glanced at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm not thirsty."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing this, everyone in the car laughed. Matty, who was usually serious, was rarely seen in such an awkward situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The three young men in the back, however, smiled lightly to themselves. Dylan especially.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The journey to the cemetery was quite pleasant, and there was nothing particularly uncomfortable about it. Everyone took good care of Amelia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When they arrived at the cemetery, there were not many graves, and the space was quite large. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In particular, Sophia's grave was located in a separate area, surrounded by green trees and flowers. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a beautiful environment, and it was clear that Matty had genuine feelings for Sophia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After the Lawrence family paid their respects to Sophia, Amelia looked at the photo on the tombstone and silently said in her heart:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mother.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I have seen what your mother looks like.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I also know where she is, her name, her date of birth, and the date of her passing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I have looked after her and paid my respects. Rest in peace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matty, dressed in a suit, stood in front of the tombstone, not touching it or talking as he usually did. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was clear that he was still angry with Sophia for sending her daughter away and for </span><span>using this method to retaliate against him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After the Lawrence family finished paying their respects, everyone gradually left the cemetery, leaving only Matty, who remained silent for a long time before turning around.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sophia, I have found your daughter's descendants. You can rest assured. I will take good care of the children."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before getting into the car, Amelia turned back and looked at Matty. This old man with white hair was still quite spirited, but his steps were a bit unsteady.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia looked at him for a few seconds, then turned back and got into the car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dylan said there was a banquet in the evening and that he would take Amelia to get her hair and makeup done and buy some clothes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matty then asked the three Lawrence brothers to accompany her for shopping, and they agreed to return home at 8 p.m.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The banquet was not held in a luxurious place, but in Sophia's house. He felt that in Sophia's home, Sophia would be able to see, which made him a stubborn and loyal old man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The three Lawrence brothers, away from the elders, seemed much more casual. Owen looked very serious, but once he took the wheel, he changed. He drove the business car like a sports car on the spacious road.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eugene was afraid that Amelia would feel uncomfortable. He asked Owen to be careful and tried to close the car window, but he saw Amelia turning her head slightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The hand that was closing the window paused. "The road here is wide, with many trees. It's quite pleasant to feel the natural breeze. Have you considered living here?"</span></p></div>
