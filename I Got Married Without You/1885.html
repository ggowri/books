        <h1>Chapter 1885 Lucky Eva</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When their private jet arrived at the hospital, Eva had already come out of the delivery room. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul and Eva's relatives had rushed over to congratulate them, one wave after another. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When James and Amelia entered the hospital room, it was filled with flowers and gift boxes, most of which were sent by the Evans family. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva was lying on the delivery bed, eating porridge that Paul had fed her, while staring at the baby Rebecca was holding. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rebecca was holding the girl, while Kate was holding the boy, and Eric was sitting next to them. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dominic was also there, sitting across from Eric. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were so focused that they didn't notice the two of them entering, until Eva noticed and called out, causing everyone to turn around. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Amelia!" Seeing Amelia, Eva immediately smiled and waved at her. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come over here!" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia smiled back, holding a small gift box in her hand, and walked over slowly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps because Amelia was pregnant, Dominic had nothing to criticize. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Amelia called him "grandpa," he responded. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His demeanor was neither cold nor indifferent, as if he didn't care, but much better than before when he strongly opposed it. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After dealing with a few elders, Amelia greeted Rebecca and received a gracious response, allowing her to go and talk to Eva first. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia knew that Rebecca didn't care about such formalities, so she nodded with a smile, turned around, and quickly walked towards Eva lying on the delivery bed. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Eva, how are you? Are you okay? Is there anything uncomfortable?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia's first concern was Eva's well-being, while everyone else was focused on the baby. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Especially Dominic, who initially didn't plan to come when he heard that Eva had given birth to a girl. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He only came after a few minutes when the boy was born. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although they had already discovered during the prenatal check-ups that there were two babies, James didn't tell the couple because of his recent issues and Amelia's disappearance. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now that Amelia had safely returned and showed such concern, Eva felt as if her heart was filled with honey, sweet and warm. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm fine, nothing at all. And you?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm fine too, don't worry." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Amelia responded with a smile, she reached out and held Eva's hand, using her other hand to tuck Eva's slightly messy hair behind her ear. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Eva, you've worked hard." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the blink of an eye, Eva had become the mother of two children, which was great and she had finally overcome the hardships. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing the emotions in Amelia's eyes, Eva knew that she was feeling sorry for her, and couldn't help but feel a surge of emotion, her nose tingling and tears welling up. "Marrying the right person and having children is a natural thing, there's nothing hard about it." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In her life, she was actually quite happy. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had a husband who loved her, doted on her, and was willing to change for her. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although she was the owner of an entertainment venue and didn't lack money, she had also married into a wealthy family. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From a class perspective, she herself and the two children she gave birth to had also crossed boundaries. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To be honest, for someone with a low level of education like her, to live a life like this was already very good. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia knew that Eva was currently sailing smoothly and content, so she was happy </span><span>for her and squeezed her hand tightly, changing the subject. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I bought some small gifts for the two children, wishing them a safe and healthy growth." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia opened the gift box and took out two pieces of jewelry made of gold, handing them to Eva.</span></p></div>
