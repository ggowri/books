        <h1>Chapter 1768 The pain of hurting her and losing her</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The chip in his brain was implanted by 1-2, and it was 1-2 who made him the inviter. 1-2 was impressed by his skills and abilities," Emily explained, then stood up and hugged Mr. Ben's waist, speaking gently, "Ben, give me half an hour of authority. Let's not challenge his authority. Let's send him to the confinement room and let 1-2 punish him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ben, who had his finger on the detonation key, slowly moved away and instead hugged Emily's waist. "If we don't kill him now, what if 1-2 decides to use him and he turns against us using 1-2's power?" he asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You forget, we still have the biggest leverage on him. If 1-2 decides to use him, we'll expose his identity and leave him with no place to hide," Emily replied, her eyes filled with murderous intent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Satisfied with Emily's determination, Mr. Ben nodded. He entered S with James, but Master Davies favored James more, personally teaching and nurturing him, and eventually giving him the position of leader. Mr. Ben could only be James's subordinate, not even his right-hand man like Zack and Peter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had long resented James and his high-handed attitude. Fortunately, fate allowed him to discover Erebus's existence. At the same time, he met the person he liked, Emily, who had been abandoned and tormented by James. This fueled Mr. Ben's hatred towards James, prompting him to take Emily and join Erebus. Emily, who hated James even more, was given the opportunity for revenge by Mr. Ben. She became Erebus's operative, trading the list of S members with 1-2. They both became influential figures in Erebus, and even 1-4 dared not challenge them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mr. Ben received unprecedented attention in Erebus, something S could not provide or perhaps did not want to provide. Thinking of James's helpless agony as he watched Zack being devoured by snakes and being forced to separate from his wife, Mr. Ben couldn't help but smile. James probably never expected to be played and controlled by him one day.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Mr. Ben stared at the unconscious James with a dark smile, Emily reached out and held his arm, asking, "Ben, has my father left already?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Brandon has been waiting at the destination for a while. As soon as the black-clad men escorting Amelia leave, he will kill her," Mr. Ben replied, redirecting his gaze towards Emily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emily hated Amelia more than James, believing that she had stolen James from her. She had already planned for her father to take Amelia away once Erebus's people arrived at the destination, allowing them to kill her without breaking Erebus's rules.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking of how she had manipulated these two people, Emily's mood soared. Of course, it was also thanks to Amelia's inability to let go of James that she was lured into Erebus. Otherwise, Emily would have had to send someone to kill her outside, which would have been troublesome and wouldn't have resulted in such a spectacular show.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emily glanced at James and coldly sneered in her heart, "Since you cherish and protect Amelia so much, then endure the pain of hurting her and losing her again!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emily then put away her malicious gaze and tightened her grip on Mr. Ben's arm, smiling as she said, "Ben, let's go back to our room, open a bottle of champagne to celebrate, and then..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She leaned in and whispered in Mr. Ben's ear, "I'll reward you well, for as long as you want..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mr. Ben, upon hearing this, lifted her chin and kissed her deeply. "Alright, but let's first take care of the wound on your neck," he said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emily didn't mind and wiped away the blood on her neck. "This wound is a witness to our successful revenge. Let it bleed and celebrate with us," she said.</span></p></div>
