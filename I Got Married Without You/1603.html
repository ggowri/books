        <h1>Chapter 1603 The biggest mistake</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But that's not enough. Erin's mistake wasn't big enough, so Karen had Stella get close to Erin. She wanted Stella to fall in love with Erin first, and then use that love to get Erin's heart in return. She thought that if the two kids had a connection, someone like Erin, who was reckless and free-spirited, wouldn't be able to resist Stella.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But surprisingly, Erin never fell for Stella, even though Karen hinted at him by letting Stella going in and out of his bathroom and room. Karen, who thought her plan was going to fail, happened to see Erin sneaking into Stella's room late at night.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Karen followed him quietly and opened the door a crack. She saw Erin standing by Stella's bed, staring at her for a long time. Then suddenly, he leaned in and lightly kissed Stella's lips. After the kiss, he got startled, as if he had surprised himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Erin's amorous behavior, Karen knew that half of her plan had succeeded. And in the following times, she even witnessed Erin becoming bolder. He would kiss Stella when she was asleep, and each time the kisses lasted longer than the previous ones, but he never went further.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Karen planned to wait for the day when Erin would make a mistake on his own, but she didn't expect that before that happened, Thomas got into an argument with Erin's grandfather because of Erin's career direction. Karen never imagined that even with Erin's tarnished reputation, Thomas still hadn't given up on the idea of making him the heir. When she heard Thomas say that if Erin studied finance, he would let him take over the family business after graduation, she panicked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had been planning for so many years not to push Erin to be the heir, but for her </span><span>own son. Otherwise, once Erin gained power, she would be under Erin's feet in the Simpson family and her status would be diminished. And who knew, the grown-up Erin, who could manipulate everything, might even try to seek revenge for his mother.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To prevent Erin from gaining power, Karen even thought about drugging him and tempting him to rape Stella. Just then, a boy named Mason happened to bring Stella home. She knew it was a great opportunity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She quickly guided Stella to like Mason and created opportunities for them to be alone together, intentionally making Erin jealous. Karen knew that a young guy like Erin, once he became jealous, would inevitably become agitated and might do something foolish.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Erin was surprisingly tolerant. He saw Mason coming out of Stella's room several times and chose to turn a blind eye. What could she do? She could only push things further. When they were about to graduate from high school, she started openly and subtly urging Mason to confess his feelings to Stella.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that time, Mason had a crush on Stella but was afraid that she didn't like him. Karen said that if Stella didn't like him, she would have rejected him long ago. It was just that Stella was shy. In fact, it was Karen who advised Stella not to reject Mason, but Mason didn't know that. He really thought that if Stella didn't reject him, it meant she liked him. He even took Karen's advice and confessed to Stella on a cruise ship.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Mason took Stella onto the ship, Karen found Erin and told him that Mason was going to confess to Stella. Then they would sail around the world together. Erin was still holding back at that time. To push him further, Karen smiled at Erin and said, "I wonder if Stella will get pregnant after spending two months together. If Stella gets pregnant, she'll marry Mason." This made Erin furious and his face turned pale. He started cursing Stella, calling her shameless, and went crazy looking for someone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Karen wasn't sure if the infuriated Erin would personally attack Stella or send someone to do it. But based on her understanding of Erin, she knew he would choose the latter. Because Erin had both hatred and some liking for Stella, although he probably wasn't aware of the liking. </span><span>So</span><span> the hatred he had for Stella would outweigh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And she guessed right. That idiot Erin actually thought that Stella was going to be with another man. He believed that a woman like Stella couldn't live without a man, so he sent a group of people to scare her. But because of this, he unintentionally helped Karen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To make sure those people succeeded, Karen had someone injure the caretaker who had raised Erin and then tricked the caretaker into calling Erin, asking him to come back and save him. The caretaker, holding his head covered in blood, quickly called Erin, who was skilled in medicine...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Erin probably never knew that this was Karen's plan. But whether he knew or not, every time Karen thought about this coincidental event, she couldn't help but laugh. How could someone be so foolish?</span></p></div>
