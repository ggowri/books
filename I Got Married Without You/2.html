        <h1>Chapter 2 Never Used His Money, Not Even a Penny</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">After James left, Andrew, his assistant, walked in with the pill.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He handed the pill to Amelia and said respectfully, "Ms. Garcia, please take it as usual."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">This was a birth control pill. He didn't love her, let alone allow her to get pregnant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">After having sex, Andrew would always come with the pill and he would stand there watching to make sure she took it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Staring at the pill, Amelia's heart started to hurt.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She wasn&rsquo;t sure if the pain was caused by heart failure or James's cruelty, but regardless, it was so intense that she struggled to take a breath.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Ms. Garcia..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Seeing that Amelia didn't take the pill, Andrew urged her with a nervous expression, afraid that she would cause trouble on the last night with James.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Amelia glanced at him, took over the pill, and put it in her mouth. She didn't even drink water with it and forced it down.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Andrew let out a breath of relief, then he took an apartment deed and check from his briefcase and placed them in front of Amelia.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Ms. Garcia, this is Mr. Evans&rsquo; compensation for you. In addition to real estate and luxury cars, he also gave you 5 million dollars. All yours."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">How generous.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Too bad, he never knew what she truly wanted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"I don't want it," Amelia looked up at Andrew with a smile and said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Andrew was stunned and confused. "Do you think it&rsquo;s not enough?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Hearing this, Amelia felt heartbroken.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Even Andrew thought she was doing it for the money, let alone James.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He offered her such a high breakup fee. Was it because he was afraid she would pester him again for more money in the future?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Amelia picked up the bag beside her with a bitter smile, took out a debit card, and handed it to Andrew. "This is all the money James paid me over the years, I never spent a single penny. You can give it all back to him. Oh and the pin number for this card is his birthday."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Andrew was dumbfounded. Did Ms. Garcia really never use any of Mr. Evans&rsquo; money in the past five years? Amelia didn't care whether Andrew believed her or not. She placed the card on the pile of documents Andrew brought for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Then she turned around and left the Silver Tower Penthouse</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&hellip;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Winter was cold in Arcadia.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Amelia walked alone on the empty street.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Her thin figure was cast on the ground by the street light, looking gaunt and fragile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She tightened her beige coat, gritted her teeth, and walked back to her apartment in her high heels.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She pushed the door open. It was huge inside, taking up an entire floor.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Despite the luxurious decorations, the apartment couldn&rsquo;t seem to dispel the chill that permeated Amelia&rsquo;s heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She sat on the sofa, stared blankly at the surroundings for a moment, then Amelia began to pack.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">This apartment was also given to her by James.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Since he did not want her anymore, she would not take anything that he gave her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Amelia took out her suitcase, opened the closet, and put all her clothes into the suitcase.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She didn't bring many things here, and after a quick pack, she left the apartment with her suitcase.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">After getting into the car, she sent a text message to Andrew.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">[Andrew, the password of Hudson Apartment is 0826.]</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Andrew was smart. He immediately understood when he saw the text message.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Not only did Ms. Garcia not spend a penny from Mr. Evans, but she also didn't want the apartment Mr. Evans gave her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She had packed her stuff promptly and efficiently, she was nothing like the girl from five years ago. The crying girl who begged Mr. Evans to purchase her virginity for a million dollars.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Andrew returned to the company, handed the things back to James, and told him what Amelia said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">With an indifferent gaze, James glanced at the items on his desk. Then, his cold gaze was fixed on the debit card.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"There is an added one million dollars in there?" he asked Andrew coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Yes." Andrew nodded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Before Andrew returned to the company, he went to the ATM to check the balance on the card.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Other than the money that Mr. Evans transferred to Amilea every month, there were another million dollars in it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Obviously, this was the money Amelia had returned to James for buying her that night.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">James frowned. After pondering for a while, he stretched out his hand, picked up the card, and snapped it in half</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He pushed the pile of deed certificates and other things towards Andrew and said in a cold voice, "Get rid of it then."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Andrew opened his mouth and wanted to say something nice for Amelia, but James had already turned on his computer and started to work.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Andrew sensibly shut his mouth, picked up the pile of documents, and left the office.</p></div>
