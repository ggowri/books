        <h1>Chapter 1794 Eva had been missing Amelia</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia nodded lightly and, after a long silence, told Eva about what had happened with Erebus. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva listened and was stunned for a moment, then raised her hand and gently touched Amelia's thin and weak face. " You've suffered," she said. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She only said this one sentence, without trying to persuade Amelia or speak on behalf of James, but it was enough to express everything. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia wanted to shake her head and say that she hadn't, but the pain in her heart surged out in response to Eva's comforting words. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Eva." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm here," Amelia reached out and grabbed Eva's hand, which was resting on her face, and held it tightly against her chest. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm actually quite sad." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva knew that she was very sad. Risking everything to find her husband, only to be suddenly divorced upon meeting him, who could bear such a thing? </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva felt very sorry for Amelia and couldn't help but reach out her other hand to cover Amelia's hand, which had become thin and bony over the past two months. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you want to talk about it, tell me all your grievances," Eva said. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia slowly lowered her eyelids. "There's nothing to be sad about. </span><span>I'm used to it</span><span>." She was used to James's emotional abuse, used to being pushed away by him, and only felt sad afterwards. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva couldn't help but pat Amelia's hand repeatedly, hoping that this would comfort her. Amelia probably didn't want Eva to be upset with her, so she didn't continue </span><span>speaking and just said to her, "Eva, when I'm discharged from the hospital, I won't return to Blue Bay Island. When that time comes, help me bring Grace to my villa." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a moment's pause, Eva agreed. "Okay." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After agreeing, Eva couldn't help but call out to her again. "Amelia." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia looked up and looked at Eva, who seemed hesitant to speak. "Eva, just say what you want to say." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva then grabbed her hand and gently patted her hand. "I support whatever decision you make, but as your sister, I still have to remind you." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her gaze moved from Amelia's face to her abdomen. "You still have a child. After the child is born, you can't just let the child grow up without a father, can you?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both of them were orphans, and they knew how difficult it was to grow up without parents. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Amelia's child would have a mother, a childhood without a father would still be incomplete. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they both lived their lives feeling inferior due to the absence of their parents' love and care. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After staring at Eva for a while, Amelia raised her hand and touched her abdomen. "He never considered whether the child needed a father. Why should I have to think about it so much?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although this sentence stopped Eva from saying anything further, she could still hear from Amelia's tone that she was actually just being stubborn with James. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva couldn't help but feel that such a loving couple wouldn't easily separate. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With this thought in mind, she gradually felt more at ease. "Amelia, is there anything you'd like to eat?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Amelia could respond, there was a knock at the door. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Can we come in now?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva looked back in the direction of the door and gestured with her eyes to ask Amelia if it was okay. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You can," Amelia replied, then propped herself up on the bed. As soon as she sat up, Paul, Andrew, and Peter walked in. "Amelia, are you okay?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm fine, don't worry." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You look very weak, so be sure to rest more." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay." Amelia nodded and then jokingly teased Paul. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A soon-to-be father is different; you're already showing concern for others." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul, seeing that she was still in the mood to joke, let go of his worries. "People always grow up," he said, pulling up a chair and sitting down next to Eva. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He then habitually took her hand and began to rub it in his palm. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva felt a bit embarrassed to be so intimate in front of so many people and wanted to pull her hand away, but he held it tightly. "What are you afraid of? Amelia isn't a stranger." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's right, we're not strangers." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Andrew and Peter, who were standing nearby, added. After learning that James was still alive, the two months of gloom they had experienced gradually dissipated. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Peter, who had almost turned A</span><span>rcadia</span><span> upside down after Amelia disappeared. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And because of this, Andrew openly and fiercely beat him up. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But they had to come together to investigate the exact location of Erebus, so the two of them often ended up fighting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, both of them had </span><span>scars</span><span> on their faces.</span></p></div>
