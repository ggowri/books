        <h1>Chapter 1699 Let's play another round</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Johnny's mind was filled with all sorts of thoughts, but could he really kiss Amelia? </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if Amelia wasn't married, Johnny wouldn't dare to make a move on a woman he just liked through a game. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wanted mutual affection, but from the moment he fell for Amelia, he knew that was just wishful thinking. It could never happen in this lifetime. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Johnny suppressed his feelings, raised his foot, and kicked Herb hard. "What kind of stupid idea was that? Am I the kind of person who can kiss anyone?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying that, he quickly glanced at Amelia, controlled his emotions, and left. "We've already delivered Eva's wedding gift. Goodbye." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Herb was reluctant to leave without getting to James, but when Johnny shot him a </span><span>fierce look, Herb immediately backed down and followed him. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop!" A chilling voice came from behind. Herb instinctively shrank his neck. Could it be... James wasn't going to let him off the hook? </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Clark, come over here." Herb swallowed nervously and slowly turned around. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man sitting on the couch stared at him with a murderous gaze. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing the murderous intent in James' eyes, Herb didn't dare to go near. "Mr. Evans, I..." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's play another round. The rules will be announced after the game." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Herb thought James would kill him directly, but he didn't expect James to suggest playing another round. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Herb didn't understand what James was planning. He had a feeling that James would find a way to get rid of him. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked to Johnny for help, but Johnny didn't even glance at him and left the cabin. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Johnny left, and James didn't stop him. It meant that James only had eyes for him... </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without waiting for Herb's agreement, Paul placed two shuffled cards in front of him. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There are two jokers here. If you draw the big joker, you can leave. If not..." Paul paused for a moment, then turned to show Herb the murderous intent in James' eyes. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone in the Evans Family respected Amelia, except for Sir Evans. Even his brothers didn't dare to look at Amelia too much, just to show their respect for her. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Herb, this little troublemaker, dared to embarrass Amelia on the Evans Family's territory. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Herb looked at James, thought for a moment, and considering his luck earlier, maybe he could draw the big joker this time. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hesitantly reached out his trembling hand and picked the card on the right side... </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul gave him a cold glance and revealed the two cards. "The one on the right is the small joker, and the one on the left is the big joker. You're doomed." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Herb's heart skipped a beat, and he subconsciously looked at James, who was enveloped in a murderous aura. "What are the rules for winning or losing?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James didn't answer him. He just took out a pair of white gloves and calmly put them on. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After putting them on, the tall and imposing man stood up from the couch and walked towards him with steady steps. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man naturally emanated a sense of dominance, coupled with the intimidation from being in a high position for a long time, he felt like a mountain pressing down on Herb. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you going to apologize on your knees, or should I slap you a few times?" Although James wasn't wearing his studded gloves this time, his palm strikes were still powerful. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After taking a few slaps, Herb's face would surely swell for days. But in front of the Evans Family, if he kneeled and apologized, he would lose all his dignity. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My patience is limited." A cold voice mixed with anger echoed in Herb's ears, and he felt an uncomfortable pressure from his older brother. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I choose the slaps." He would rather be beaten than apologize to his enemy. This was the Clark family's dignity! </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James raised his gaze, glanced at the defiant Herb, and without any hesitation, slapped him hard a few times. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After receiving four consecutive slaps, Herb covered his swollen face and looked pitifully at James, who was ready to continue hitting him. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I was wrong. Can't that be enough?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But James only paused for a moment before raising his hand to slap him again. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Herb quickly leaned back to avoid a fatal blow. After stabilizing himself with the help of his waist, he begged James for mercy. "I'll never joke about Amelia again. Please let me go..."</span></p></div>
