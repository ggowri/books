        <h1>Chapter 1604 Legal consequences</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she reminisced about the past, the smile that she tried to hide was all too visible to Stella. Stella had a vague inkling that whether it was during their childhood when she encouraged her to get close to Erin, or as they grew older when she manipulated her </span><span>into falling for Erin, it was all part of Karen's plan. Even the later harm inflicted upon her, which she blamed on Erin, was just because Karen knew that Thomas wanted Erin to be the heir...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was ultimately just a pawn in Karen's hands...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, the person who treated her </span><span>as a pawn</span><span> was still holding her hand and shifting the blame onto others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stella, no matter when it started, you have to know that it was Erin who provoked me first. From the moment I stepped into the picture, he constantly insulted me and even called me a homewrecker in private. If you want to blame someone, blame him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stella curled her lips in a bitter smile and suddenly burst into laughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aren't you the homewrecker?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With tears in her eyes, she stared at her unfamiliar aunt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In order to escape the identity of a small-town girl, you climbed into Thomas's bed, knowing full well that he was married. Erin saw you wearing his mother's clothes, fooling around with his father in his mother's room. He hated you for that. And what's more, you forcefully moved into the Simpson family, driving his mother crazy to the point where she jumped off a building. Who else should he blame if not you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These things were what Stella had heard from others as she grew older, and even though her worldview had been greatly shaken at the time, she still chose to believe Karen's explanations. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, Karen's excuse was that she had no power or influence, and she couldn't escape from someone as powerful as Thomas. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, Stella realized that Karen was truly talented. She could turn black into white. At that time, she was even grateful to her aunt...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If the harm Erin caused her was a score of ten thousand, then Karen's was a hundred thousand. The gentle and kind aunt that she believed in turned out to be a facade... Even the love she showed her was just a lie...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No wonder Erin treated her like that. How could she not treat Erin well while secretly tormenting him? Karen hadn't read many books, but she had exceptional acting skills...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She pretended to </span><span>care about </span><span>Erin on the surface but tortured him behind his back. She deceived Stella from beginning to end, there was nothing truthful about her...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stella's heart ached so much that it felt like it was bleeding. This truth, presented in front of her, was more painful than death itself because she truly regarded Karen as her mother, a mother who had redeemed her...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stella couldn't control herself anymore. She raised her hand and covered her tearful eyes. How could Karen be so cruel? Why did she treat her as a mere pawn, a pawn she had used for over twenty years? How could she hurt her like this...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stella, as I've told you, Thomas forced me into this. I didn't willingly become the </span><span>homewrecker</span><span>..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing such a deceitful excuse, Stella stopped talking. Arguing with someone of twisted morals would only make her seem foolish.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wiped away her tears, pushed away the hand that had been covering hers, and slowly stood up, supporting herself against the edge of the sofa...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was no need to ask anymore. Those people who fell into the water by accident, Erin must have sent someone to get rid of them after he found out about his own gang rape. The others who escaped and were imprisoned, Karen must have bribed them not to speak. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only Karen knew, but she wouldn't tell Stella. After those thugs were released from prison, Erin sent people to kill them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the time, those thugs sought refuge with her, threatening to expose the truth if she didn't give them money to leave the country. In order to keep them under control, Karen used Bart's account to transfer money and help them escape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Erin never investigated the thugs' accounts at that time; he just sent people to track them down and have them killed. Most of the accidental deaths of those thugs were the result of Erin's actions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Erin probably never expected that because of his hatred, he not only solved her hidden dangers but also allowed her to reap the benefits.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Karen thought of this and looked up at Stella, who had turned to grab her bag.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stella, I've never killed anyone. Even if you know the truth, you can only hate me, but I will never face legal consequences for these old matters."</span></p></div>
