        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ryan brought it as he was supposed to, gritting his teeth and taking a step back with his cane, despite the pain in his heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Amelia, if you need any help, remember to give me a call."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He restrained himself and never crossed the line because he was willing to be her family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia was still the same as before, obediently nodding her head no matter what he said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ryan gazed deeply at Amelia one last time before turning around and getting back into the car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the car door closed, Ryan looked through the window at Amelia standing on the side of the road.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia kept her head down, staring at the torn 'farewell letter' on the ground...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Ryan's car disappeared into the distance, Amelia finally spoke up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Peter, call Holden and tell him to come see me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Peter was afraid that Amelia wouldn't be able to handle everything once she found out, but when he saw her determined expression, he nodded in agreement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as Holden received Peter's call, he knew that some things couldn't be kept hidden any longer. So instead of avoiding it, he held the urn and went to Blue Bay Island.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he walked in, Amelia was sitting on the living room couch, holding a photo between her fingers. It was a picture she had secretly taken while James was sleeping.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Holden stood still, staring at Amelia's pale face. After a moment, he took a step forward and stood in front of her without saying a word. He simply placed the urn in his hand on the table.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia's gaze, at the moment she saw the urn, all of her previous mental preparation suddenly collapsed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Whose is this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her hoarse voice was trembling as her frail body shook, tears silently rolling down her cheeks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Holden laid eyes on Amelia, he suddenly didn't know how to approach the situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia couldn't stand seeing him like this, so she quickly got up and pulled on his clothes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Davies, please speak up."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She held onto her last shred of sanity, going from yelling to pleading, all in search of one answer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Holden's sorrowful gaze shifted away from her face and landed on the urn placed on the </span><span>table...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's Zack's."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Holden lifted his finger and touched the cold urn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's Zack's."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He repeated it twice before Amelia could understand, and the fear in her heart loosened a bit. But the urn was Zack's, which also made her feel a chill run down her spine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Peter, who was standing next to him, heard that the urn contained Zack's ashes and his usually upright posture suddenly shook.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before either of them could react, a voice of disbelief came from outside the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Whose ashes are in that urn?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia looked up at the sound and saw Gigi standing at the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Behind her, Johnny was also following in a black suit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia was surprised when Gigi showed up at her door after waiting for 22 days, only to find out that Zack still hadn't arrived.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia couldn't help but think about the fact that Gigi was carrying Zack's child, but he would never know. Tears welled up in her eyes and she couldn't stop them from falling...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gigi saw Amelia crying and had a faint idea of what was going on, but didn't want to believe it. She forced herself to walk towards Holden, her body trembling and on the verge of collapsing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why aren't you answering my question?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Faced with Gigi's questioning, Holden gritted his teeth and lowered his gaze, repeating himself for the third time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The urn belongs to Zack."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gigi stood frozen in place, staring blankly at the square black urn in front of her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're lying!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gigi suddenly bent down and grabbed Holden's collar, lifting him up from the couch with one hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He was just on a business trip, how could he possibly be dead? It must be you, you lying scumbag!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Holden could only hang his head, his eyes filled with sadness, as he stared at the furious Gigi.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Miss Brook, please accept my condolences."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gigi clenched her fist and punched Holden in the face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My dear Zack is doing well, who are you asking to mourn for?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was unreasonable, punching Holden in the face over and over again, leaving him bruised and swollen, but refusing to let go.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it wasn't for Peter stepping in and pulling her away, Holden might have been beaten to death by her on the couch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gigi, who was pulled away, let out a burst of anger with her fists, and then felt a surge of heat in her lower abdomen. She also felt a twisting pain and liquid flowing out from below. Gigi suddenly panicked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Amelia, help me..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia rushed forward and caught Gigi as she collapsed to the ground, her head spinning. Before Gigi lost consciousness, Amelia grabbed her hand tightly and, like a madwoman, yelled at Johnny in anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Johnny, she's pregnant, go call the doctor!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Johnny seemed unaware that Gigi was pregnant. When he heard this, he paused for a moment and then rushed to Amelia's side. He picked up the unconscious Gigi and ran outside with her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia went to the hospital as well, and she didn't relax until the doctor assured her that the child was fine. She mentioned the lump in her throat and finally let it go.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She saw that Gigi was still unconscious, so she said hello to Johnny and prepared to return to Blue Bay Island to continue questioning Holden.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Johnny stood in front of the hospital bed, but suddenly turned around and stared at Amelia. "James and Zack are both S's people, right?"</span></p></div>
