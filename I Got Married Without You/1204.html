        <h1>Chapter 1204 James was afraid that Amelia would resent him</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After the two got into the car, Amelia saw James propping his head with one hand, looking thoughtful, and guessed that he knew who the person changing the medicine was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't ask about Evans' family secret, but he turned his head to look at her with shining eyes, filled with obscure emotions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It was only yesterday that I found out my birth wasn't so honorable. Don't...don't despise me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It turned out that he was worried that she would despise his birth and that was why he looked at her with such deep and unfathomable eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia raised her delicate and fair hand and touched his thick hair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No matter what your birth is, I won't despise you. The person I love is just you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if he wasn't so wealthy or dazzling, she would love him forever.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James' tense expression slowly relaxed, and his slender hand wrapped around her waist, pulling her onto his lap.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He leaned back in the car seat, raised his sharply defined chin, and looked at her with a shallow and sweet smile, his lips curved in happiness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Say you love me a few more times, and I'll show you some new lovemaking </span><span>positions tonight."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her face turned red, and she instinctively looked back at Andrew.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She found that Andrew had already lowered the partition, and she breathed a sigh of relief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fortunately, it was separated now, and Andrew wouldn't hear it, or it would be so embarrassing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After she breathed a sigh of relief, she clenched her fist and punched James&rsquo; chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You say such explicit things, it's so annoying."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After punching him, she got off him and held onto the car door handle, refusing to let go no matter how hard he pulled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He surrendered and leaned in, "I won't say anything inappropriate anymore. Can I hug you, please?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man's sturdy chest pressed against her back, the scorching heat transmitting through her clothes, making her body tingle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sensing her reaction, James deliberately lowered his head to nibble on her earlobe, "Babe..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His low, magnetic and hoarse voice was so tantalizing that Amelia was electrified. She struggled to push the man behind her away, "Be serious."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He reached out again, encircling the petite woman from behind, "Hmm? How do you want me to be serious?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The "hmm" sound came from his throat, so sexy that it made her ears turn red. This man was really good at teasing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She turned her head, her lips brushing against his face. His eyes darkened, he had only been teasing her, but now he was reacting.</span></p></div>
