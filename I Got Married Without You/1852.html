        <h1>Chapter 1852: Blown to Smithereens</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matty froze at Amelia's hate-filled glare.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For a second, he saw Sophia in her, a mirror to the past.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maybe because of Sophia, Matty swallowed his anger and didn</span><span>'</span><span>t retaliate against the defiant Amelia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dylan, take your sister and rest in the control room," he said calmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dylan thought Matty would retaliate, but instead, he just told him to take Amelia away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Was it guilt?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dylan couldn't read Matty's thoughts. As he led Amelia away, he signaled her not to act rashly. Their priority should be escaping Erebus, not wasting time arguing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia understood and relaxed her clenched fists, following Dylan. But as they reached the door, Matty's icy voice echoed from behind, "Amelia, you promised to stay with The Lawrence Family forever before you came to Erebus. Remember?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia stopped and turned to Matty, who seemed to be in control of life and death, "My promise was based on you not deceiving me. You betrayed me. How can you expect me to keep my promise?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If your promise is invalid, then you'll replace James and stay in Erebus forever."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stay in the confinement room until I deal with James," Matty instructed Dylan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing about James, Amelia's simmering anger flared up, "Matty, your vengeance should be against S</span><span>'</span><span>s former organization, not the innocent, unborn James!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They violated your grandmother. They all deserve to die. I won't spare any of them."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then find those who violated Sophia! What does James have to do with this?!" Amelia was livid against the hate-consumed Matty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ignoring her, Matty waved his hand and the men in black by his side grabbed Dylan, "Dylan, come with us."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While Dylan had the authority to leave Erebus, Amelia didn't. So Matty only detained Dylan, leaving Amelia seething as Dylan was forcibly taken away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Matty, I will never forgive you for this," Amelia swore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From the moment she discovered the truth, Matty expected this reaction and didn't care.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's okay. As long as you stay with me, you'll understand one day."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leaving Amelia behind, Matty headed towards the confinement room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia, left behind, clenched her fists. With James gone and her trapped in Erebus, she was a liability.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Frustration filled Amelia as she approached the control console, but her lack of understanding of the system left her pounding on the controls in frustration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chaos ensued as broadcast sounds and mechanical noises filled Ace, leaving the players in the lower area confused and the operators in the middle area busy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Receiving the news, Matty didn</span><span>'</span><span>t care and even told his men to let Amelia vent, while he continued to the confinement room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once there, he whipped Dylan until he was bloody and unconscious before delivering a harsh warning about James</span><span>'</span><span> implanted chip.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once done, Matty locked Dylan in and guarded against Amelia</span><span>'</span><span>s interference. Wiping his hands with a handkerchief handed to him by his men, he asked, "Is the explosion program ready?"</span></p></div>
