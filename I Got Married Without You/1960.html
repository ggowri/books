        <h1>Chapter 1960 Missed</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Zack's death anniversary after Stella's. Amelia and James went to Aronland to visit his grave with the two children.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as the black Lincoln stopped, Alexander saw a fawn jumping out of the forest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was unknown whether he wanted to chase the deer or escape from James' control, but he opened the car door and ran into the forest while the adults were not paying attention.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing that, Amelia hurriedly got out of the car and ran over. James, who was sitting in the car, gestured to Andrew and Peter. The two immediately went to hurry after Amelia and Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James looked at the cemetery in the distance. After a long silence, he got out of the car, took out the chrysanthemums from the trunk, walked to Zack's tombstone, and put the bouquet down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Zack, I'm here to see you with my child again."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every year, James would start with the same sentence, then stand before the monument, staring at Zack's yellowed portrait, imagining whether Zack would spoil Alexander like Andrew and Peter if he were alive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James believed that he would be more doting on Alexander than Andrew and Peter did. With Zack's personality, he would carry Alexander on his neck, allowing him to climb on his head and pick on him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately, Zack had been gone. James couldn't imagine how Zack would hold Alexander's hand and walk on the street in the sunset, which reflected their silhouettes. He just had a vague picture in his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though it was just a picture, James missed him. But he felt regretful as well because he found that he would actually forget what Zack looked like after a long time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gradually, James no longer remembered Zack's appearance. It was like a movie had ended. Everything became illusory. Even the person's face was forgotten as the time went by.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James, feeling melancholy, leaned on Zack's tombstone, reminiscing about the past and regretting that he couldn't remember Zack's appearance. At this moment, a woman wearing a black coat and a beret, holding hands with a boy and a girl, walked in from another entrance of the cemetery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James recognized her at a glance. He was afraid that Gigi would be angry if she saw him and that he would remind Gigi of the painful past. So, he endured his reluctance, touched Zack's tombstone, and quickly left the cemetery from another direction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia dragged Alexander out of the forest and returned to her original position. Seeing that James was not there, she thought he had gone in first. So, she asked Andrew to get the chrysanthemums and led Alexander to the cemetery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't see James, but she passed by a woman wearing a beret and walking quickly with her head lowered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia was so focused on telling Alexander not to run around that she didn't notice the woman holding a boy and a girl.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Amelia walked to Zack's tombstone and saw two bouquets of chrysanthemums, she realized the woman who had covered her face with a hat was Gigi.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia quickly turned around and searched for Gigi among the thousands of graves. Unfortunately, she seemed to have just passed by in a hurry and disappeared into the dense jungle without looking back again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gigi actually saw James and heard Amelia scolding Alexander, but she pretended not to see them or hear anything. It was just because she had distinguished between Zack and Zenith.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gigi felt that she had betrayed Zack and was ashamed of seeing Zack's family and friends. After all, she once said she loved Zack, yet she married someone else and had someone else's children. So how could she face the people who knew Zack?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gigi ran away from Amelia and James, but Amelia and James would visit Gigi and Zenith after visiting Zack's grave every year. However, every time they went, the couple either happened to be out of the country or not at home.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Whether it was intentional avoidance or just a bad time, after so many times Amelia and James visited, they missed each other every time afterward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Someone once said that if people who were familiar with each other but distant didn't deliberately contact, it would be difficult for them to meet again. This was the case with Gigi and Zenith and them.</span></p></div>
