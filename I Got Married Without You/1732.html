        <h1>Chapter 1732 Gold Leaf, Letter E</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia took the report and left the hospital, looking out at the traffic coming and going, she suddenly not knowing where to go.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After standing frozen for a long time, she leaned against the wall, on the steps, and slowly sat down, her numb mind filled with images of James holding her, kissing her, and saying he loved her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wondered what the image would be like if James was there and knew she was pregnant, would his face, like a 10,000 year old ice sculpture, melt with joy, or would he be so happy that he would pick her up in his arms, like all fathers do? </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She couldn't imagine what kind of look James would have, all she knew was that she missed him so much, and that missing wasn't sweet, it was painful, a pain that went deep into her bones after losing the love of her life. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was alone, looking at the road weaving crowd, how she hoped James can take a step to her...... but she looked through the eyes, that familiar figure did not appear, this was all just her delusion, she lost, dropped his eyes, looking at the report, the child and James. What should she choose?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When her mind was in turmoil, a little girl of about five years old, jumped up and ran over, grabbed her arm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sister, there's an uncle who asked me to give you this."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia looked at the little girl, and then lowered her eyes to the small box in the little girl's hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Peter, who had been standing guard a short distance away, immediately stepped forward when he saw someone approaching her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia shook her head at him, signaling him not to come over, before reaching out to take it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She opened the box and a gold leaf, appeared in front of her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She picked it up and twisted it in her hand, touching it and realizing it was real gold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who gave you this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia, somewhat surprised, asked the little girl.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The little girl licked the lollipop in her hand and shook her head at her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sister, I don't know him either."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia frowned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What about that uncle?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He gave me some lollipops and left."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The little girl pointed down the hallway inside the hospital.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia looked in the direction of her finger and didn't notice anyone suspicious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She withdrew her eyes and looked again at the gold leaf in her hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The front side was pure gold, there was nothing special about it, turning it over and looking at it, the back side did have a letter engraved on it. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[E]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What did E mean?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia looked up in confusion, wanting to ask the little girl for more information, but the little girl had ran away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Squeezing the gold leaf in her hand, she looked down to continue poking around, just </span><span>in time to see the inside of the box, with a note lying on it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She quickly turned it over and opened it, with only two words written on it. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[Docks] </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia remembered that before James left, he also went to the docks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It couldn't be that this was from James to her, could it?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia's numb heart, suddenly skipped a beat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She grabbed the item in her hand and quickly got up, running towards the hospital corridors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She searched the long corridors, back and forth, but couldn't find James' figure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Somewhat drained, she held onto the wall at the end of the corridor and pressed against her panicked chest, exhaling loudly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The doctor said that she had had a major surgery and her health was too poor, so she should not move much, and should take care of her rest, or she would easily miscarry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She looked forward to the arrival of this child for a long, long time and took many, many pills. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But ...... </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia took up the gold leaf in her hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>E, didn&rsquo;t it stand for Erebus? </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If so, then the person who gave her the gold leaf could never be James, but someone from Erebus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They gave her the gold leaf and told her to go to the pier, because they expected her to look for James, so as to lure her into a trap.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just why did they want her in, what could she do with her hands and nothing?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia could not understand, pinched the gold leaf and the report, pondered for a long time, raised her hand and touched her belly ......</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In her heart, James ranked first, the child second.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking of this, Amelia put away the gold leaf, and then tore the report into two halves, and when she turned around decisively, she saw Peter, who was waiting at the far end, puzzled, looking at her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Amelia entered the clinic and came out, Peter didn't follow her, and didn't know about her pregnancy, but only knew that she was holding a report with a heavy look on her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia was not going to tell him, but was wondering where to get the sleeping pills, otherwise she would not be able to get rid of Peter and the others even if she knew how to get to Erebus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although bringing Peter and the others with her was foolproof, but even characters like Zack and James had folded in there, Peter and the others were bound to be in danger, Amelia, who didn't want to drag them down, decided to go alone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She knew that if she went by herself, she was afraid that there would be no return, but so what, her husband was there, she was bound to go to seek him, even if she would die, she would die in the place where he left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for the child, she wanted to have it for James, but with James gone, the significance of the child, for her, didn't seem so important.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, she would try her best to find a way to protect the child, thinking of this, </span><span>Amelia took out her cell phone, went to pay the bill and picked up the birth control medicine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing so many medicines, Peter still couldn't help but go up to Amelia and ask, "Ma'am, are you sick?"</span></p></div>
