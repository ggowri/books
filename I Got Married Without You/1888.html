        <h1>Chapter 1888 Ryan is quite nice</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ryan, wearing a white shirt, stood outside like a breath of fresh air, looking clean and refreshed. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Compared to his previous appearance in a wheelchair, he was now standing and very attractive. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia's gentle gaze moved from his serene and elegant face to his legs. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing his legs, able to stand straight and even walk steadily, the guilt that had been weighing on her heart gradually dissipated. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ryan had finally stood up and no longer had to spend his life in a wheelchair. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From now on, he could live a normal life. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia's eyes filled with a contented smile, but she refrained from looking at Ryan too much in the presence of James. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She simply nodded at him and then averted her gaze. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>\Ryan also avoided looking at Amelia too much. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he couldn't let go of the missed feelings, he would have to suppress them deep inside. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, she was now married and soon to be a mother. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though she had been tormented by countless nightmares, Ryan knew he had to restrain himself. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He followed Edith and approached Eva. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia stood up to give them space, holding the baby in her arms. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James, sitting on the couch, glanced at the passing pair without turning his head, showing a hint of indifference. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because Amelia had come to his side and sat down, tugging at his sleeve to show him how cute the sleeping baby was. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Amelia was completely focused on the baby, with no trace of Ryan in her eyes. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was as if Ryan's presence no longer stirred any emotions within her. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James, with his eyes fixed on Amelia's face, instinctively curved his lips and, for the first time, reached out his finger to touch Ken's little mouth. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As his finger touched the soft lips of the baby, the ice in James' eyes gradually melted. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, he heard Amelia's gentle voice saying, "Isn't he adorable?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James raised an eyebrow and lightly tapped his forehead. "Adorably ugly." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia playfully scolded him, "Don't call other people's children ugly, or our child might turn out ugly too." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James arrogantly sneered, "How could our child be ugly when both you and I are so good-looking?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although their conversation was quiet, Ryan overheard every word. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could sense how happy Amelia was without even looking at her, just by her presence. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ryan's gaze fell to the baby girl in Eva's arms. "Can I hold the baby?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course." Eva handed the baby to him. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Ryan held the baby, the suppressed emotions in his eyes gradually dissipated. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He turned around and happened to see Amelia holding the baby boy. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had lowered her head and didn't look at him, but when he caught a glimpse of her profile bathed in sunlight, he suddenly remembered what Amelia had said before. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had said, "Ryan, when we get married, let's have a pair of twins. You can hold the girl, and I'll hold the boy. Then, as we grow old, we can watch them grow up together. How does that sound?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the baby in his arms, Ryan snapped back to reality. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He coincidentally met James' distant and indifferent gaze, and quickly averted his eyes as if feeling guilty. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For that moment, they had fulfilled their past promise, and that was enough, even if they were holding each other's children... </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ryan collected his thoughts and, after holding the baby for a while, asked about the names of the two children. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They chatted for a while before he left, sending many supplements as a gift. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Ryan left, Amelia looked at him discreetly. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although he could now walk, he still suffered from severe depression, and she didn't know if her deliberate distance was right or wrong. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She couldn't find an answer, but Edith provided one: "Ryan's legs may have healed, but his depression is still quite severe. There was a time when the pain caused by his leg treatment almost drove him to suicide, but he said..." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To spare Amelia any psychological burden, Edith assured her that he would keep on living. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, even saying that could be a burden. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Edith omitted the rest and simply said, "Don't worry, he will keep on living." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia nodded gently and said to Edith, "Please help him as much as you can." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Edith looked thoughtful and said to Amelia, "If I were to say that after spending time with Ryan, I feel that he's quite nice, would you find that strange?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Edith said this, Anthony, who had come to congratulate them, happened to be at the entrance of the delivery room. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He heard Edith's words loud and clear, and his eyes suddenly lost their color.</span></p></div>
