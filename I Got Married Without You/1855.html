        <h1>Chapter 1855: Finding Paul to Crack the Code</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After six long months, Frank was finally looking at a living, breathing James again. His aged face was instantly streaked with tears of relief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. James Evans, you're finally back. I thought..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm fine."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a gentle pat on Frank's shoulder, James reassured the old man and headed straight to his study.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing that James looked busy, Frank didn't dare to disturb him. He instructed the chef to prepare a feast and went to pick up Grace from school.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ever since James and Amelia left, Grace had been missing them. The adults had been through dangerous times.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Frank told her they were on a business trip to ease her worries, but Grace, smarter than most kids, didn't believe that people on a business trip wouldn't even call or video chat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With James back, Frank breathed a sigh of relief, finally having something to tell Grace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James had a chip in his head, a fact he hadn't disclosed to Andrew. He frowned slightly when he saw Andrew following him into the study.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Andrew, I'm safe now. You can go back to your family."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>During James' absence, Andrew had become a father. His newborn child and recovering wife needed him, but Andrew refused to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Evans, you'll need to plan a lot to take the S team back. Count me in, let me help."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James thought for a moment, then picked up a pen and wrote down the name of the previous S organization, darkness, and Sophia's name. He handed the note to Andrew.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Find out why this organization wants to kill Sophia. Find out everything."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Andrew, now with a task, took the note and left the study.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Watching Andrew leave, James leaned back into the sofa, his body relaxing for the first time in half a year.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But it was only a moment of relaxation. He quickly moved to his computer, typing in the chip program recorded in his head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James knew Matty had altered the program. The code he was typing out now wouldn't do much, but he could guess the altered program based on the original one.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James was smart and had a photographic memory, but when it came to programming, he couldn't outsmart Matty. Seeing the word "encrypted" appearing on his screen over and over, he had to call Paul.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul was a computer genius and a renowned hacker. With his help, they might be able to rewrite the program.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul was massaging Eva's legs when he received James' call. Recognizing James' unique voice, he jumped up excitedly, "James, you're back! I'll come right away, wait for me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before James could even tell him why he was needed, Paul had hung up in his excitement...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My dear, are you feeling better? If not, I</span><span>'</span><span>ll finish massaging you before going to James..." Paul looked at Eva.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm much better, go find James. Don't worry about me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Take care. Call me if you feel uncomfortable." With a kiss on Eva's forehead, Paul rushed out to his car. He drove at top speed to Blue Bay Island and stormed into James' study.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"James!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing James safe and sound, sitting in front of his computer just like before, Paul's </span><span>emotions were on a roller coaster ride.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I knew you were fine!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man who had always believed James would return safe and sound was finally able to release all his worry and fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He opened his arms and walked over to give James a bear hug, but James pushed him away with a stern look.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Enough talk, come and work."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James pointed at the screen, where lines of code were popping up one by one.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is a chip program that can listen in, locate, and detonate. Can you disable it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul, who had wanted to ask about James' experience in Erebus, swallowed his questions when he saw how serious and urgent James looked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul leaned in to examine the lines of code, then took James' computer and sat down beside him.</span></p></div>
