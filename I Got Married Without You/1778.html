        <h1>Chapter 1778 Carson won't betray Erebus easily</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carson seemed to guess what he was about to do, wanted to agree, but also a little worried. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After hesitating for a few seconds, he still decisively nodded. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Follow me," James said, ignoring the blood-soaked wounds, and got up to follow Carson to the programming room. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After sitting down at the console, he quickly modified the program based on the simple programming on the controller. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His long but blood-stained fingers quickly tapped the code. Carson looked at the screen and then at the time. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There are ten minutes left. 1-2 will return to the program room in Area A." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>During this time period, 1-2 was usually in the program room in Area B. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>1-2's time management was very strict, and everything was scheduled for each time period. Unless there were special circumstances, he would not deviate from the schedule or waste any time. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"When he returns to the program room, he will find that you have modified the program, and then..." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before he could finish speaking, James rewrote the chip controlling the brain. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He first turned off the location, then turned off the monitoring, and then quickly rewrote the explosive function. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Venom, staring at the screen, blinked in disbelief as he looked James up and down. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No wonder 1-1 and 1-2 were reluctant to kill him... This kid was really quite capable. Although the explosive program couldn&rsquo;t be eliminated all at once, it could be detonated within half an hour. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After doing all this, he started writing a set of codes that Venom couldn't understand. "What are you doing?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James didn't respond to Venom, and after finishing the operation, he picked up the controller and hid it on his body. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing that he didn't reply, Venom didn't ask any more questions and just looked at the time on his wrist. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Four minutes is enough, let's go, I'll give you permission to leave Erebus." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if Venom killed Mr. Ben and helped </span><span>James</span><span> escape, 1-2 would still let him go because he was the first to join Erebus, but James, who arbitrarily changed 1-1's permissions, might not be so lucky. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hurry, let's go, I'll give you permission to leave Erebus." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Venom urged James to leave, but James, unhurriedly, took a wet towel from the nearby programmer's desk and slowly wiped his fingers. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you know 1-2's true identity?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Venom frowned and looked at James, just catching a glimpse of a pair of crimson eyes. The madness and killing intent emanating from those eyes were like a madman crawling out of hell, full of evil and darkness. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing this expression, Carson subconsciously frowned, and even his tall body suddenly shivered. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He felt that if he didn't answer that he didn't know, the other party would strangle him to death. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why are you asking this?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James, after wiping the blood off his fingers, raised his blood-stained face and looked coldly at Carson. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He installed a chip in my brain, and I'll settle the score with him after I get out." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carson looked James up and down, half-believing and half-doubting. "Even if you are my sister's son-in-law, I can't reveal their identities, it's the rule." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carson was tied to James because of Amelia and </span><span>Johnny</span><span>, and they cooperated with each other. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These two families had indeed made peace, but that didn't mean Carson could betray the founders of Erebus for James. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For the loyal Carson, no matter who it was, he would not reveal the true identities of the founders. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James knew that Carson was not Mr. Ben and would not easily betray Erebus. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was just a casual attempt, and since the other party didn't say anything, he didn't </span><span>force it, but... </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James threw away the wet towel in his hand, raised his cold and sinister eyes, stared at Carson for a few seconds, and then suddenly stepped forward, striding towards Carson. "I'm sorry, uncle." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carson thought he was just calling out to his uncle because of Amelia, and didn't pay much attention, only focusing on the apology.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as he was wondering why James was apologizing, he was suddenly grabbed by a strong and powerful arm around his neck. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Being inexplicably strangled like this, Carson's face under the mask instantly turned dark. "What are you trying to do?"</span></p></div>
