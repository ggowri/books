        <h1>Chapter 1205 Amelia guessed who James’ real mother was (1)</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She helplessly touched her forehead, and asked him, "Honey, who is your biological mother?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wasn't asking out of curiosity, but rather wanted him to be serious and talk about something important. However, she noticed his face suddenly darken.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed like she had touched upon an untouchable bottom line, causing the light in his eyes to dim and making him seem lifeless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She became anxious and reached out to touch his face to comfort him, but he grabbed her wrist and then put her aside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After putting her down, James leaned back in his chair and lifted his slender, fair fingers to press hard against his temple. He looked extremely exhausted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia saw him pressing his temple like before and became nervous. She grabbed his arm and asked, "Honey, is your headache acting up again?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His head was indeed hurting, but he didn't want her to worry, so he quickly put down his fingers and pretended nothing was wrong. "It's not hurting. I'm just a little tired. Don't worry about it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James had a brain tumor before, so Amelia couldn't help but worry. "If there's anything wrong, you have to tell me. Don't keep it from me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James lowered his head and looked at her with a conflicted and hesitant expression. He seemed to think that keeping it from her was wrong, but he also didn't want to tell </span><span>her the truth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia had been with James for so many years that she could guess what he was thinking from just one change in his expression. Just by asking about his biological mother, he had a headache and couldn't face her. This meant that his biological mother had something to do with her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia recalled that after Dominic found out she was a Clark family member, he stressed that they had to get a divorce and absolutely could not be together, she thought it was because of the feud, but now when she thought about it, she thought it should be more than that ......</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After James finished talking with Dominic in the study, he fell into endless despair and hesitated to touch her. He only overcame his obstacles and touched her after a while. In the past, James would not have hesitated at all when making love with her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, when she asked him about his biological mother, he immediately let go of her and seemed afraid to touch her again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All these signs made Amelia wonder if she was right and they were actually siblings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought of this because she had told James before that she would never divorce him for any reason unless they were siblings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that time, James&rsquo; body visibly stiffened, as if he had hit the nail on the head. He subconsciously looked away and didn't dare to look at her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After connecting these doubts, she turned her head to look at the man with lowered eyelashes, hiding his complex emotions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Could it be that your biological mother is from the Clark family?"</span></p></div>
