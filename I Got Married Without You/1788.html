        <h1>Chapter 1788 Bring her back home</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>So</span><span> after </span><span>Sumasa</span><span> died, her daughter also went missing?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>1-1's voice brought Carson's thoughts back to the past. "That's right." </span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>paused and then asked again. "And what happened after she went missing?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"After she went missing, the elder daughter ended up in the slums, and the younger daughter was sold several times by human traffickers, eventually being sold back to the country and becoming an orphan." </span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>was still not certain about </span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sumasa's</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span> identity, but his hands were already trembling. "And then?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"After that..." Carson let out a heavy sigh. "The elder daughter, Skender, was tortured to death by her boyfriend a few years ago, and the younger daughter might be doing a little better, having married James." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carson did not know the specific experiences of Skender and Amelia, so he only briefly explained, not saying anything more. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Sumasa's</span><span> elder daughter... is already dead?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>1-1's eyes showed disbelief, and Carson nodded. "She's been dead for many years." Seeing 1-1's expression, which seemed stunned, Carson felt that something was off about him. "Boss, why are you so interested in </span><span>Sumasa</span><span> and her daughters?" </span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>came to his senses and shook his head at Carson. "You should leave." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ignoring Carson's hesitation, he got up and left. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once he had left, the black-clad men who had been sent out immediately called. "Sir, there's no one on the deserted island." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Understood." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The fact that there was no one meant that Amelia had been rescued. As long as she had been rescued, there was hope that she was still alive. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking this, 1-1 picked up his phone and called 1-3, but there was no answer. </span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>anticipated what had happened and quickly put on his mask, heading to the biochemistry area. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as he entered, he saw a group of black-clad men lying on the floor in the biochemistry area. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James had single-handedly taken down all of them with a surgical knife. And 1-3 was wrestling with James, both covered in blood, but neither willing to give in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing this scene, 1-1 frowned and drew his gun, firing a shot towards the wall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bang!" The loud gunshot exploded in the room, and the two men fighting stopped and looked in the direction of the gunshot. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why are you fighting?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Questioned by 1-1, 1-3, somewhat embarrassed, pushed James away and got up from the ground. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This bastard said I couldn't beat him in a one-on-one fight, I didn't believe it, so I..." He disarmed himself, throwing away his weapon, and started fighting James. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they fought, the black-clad men, seeing him at a disadvantage, joined in. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But James remained silent even as he was surrounded and beaten, pulling him and </span><span>beating him to a pulp. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing this, 1-3, who had never been bullied in his life, ordered the black-clad men not to use their guns and joined in himself. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing 1-3 being beaten up, 1-1 glared at him and then nodded towards the door. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come with me." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After 1-3 respectfully nodded, he quickly followed 1-1 out of the biochemistry area. Once they were out, 1-3 took off his headgear and spat out a mouthful of blood. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Boss, James is quite something, I quite like him." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Didn't you see? He was trying to provoke you on purpose to take off your mask, wasn't he?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I saw it..." 1-3 wiped the blood from the corner of his mouth with his hand. "If he dares to take off your mask, I'll shoot him and kill him." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Be careful around him in the future." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Facing 1-1's intimidating presence, 1-3 was still afraid of him and quickly nodded respectfully. "Yes." </span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>took out his phone and brought up the surveillance footage, handing it to 1-3. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing the face on the screen, 1-3 was suddenly stunned. "Who is this?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This child is called </span><span>Amelia,</span><span> she is James's wife." </span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>explained briefly and then coldly ordered 1-3. "Go find her and bring her back home." </span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>understood and nodded at 1-1. "And what about James?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't do anything to him for now." 1-3 handed the phone back to 1-1. "Okay, I'll go find her now."</span></p></div>
