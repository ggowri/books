        <h1>Chapter 1657 Paul, you jerk</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva looked expressionless as she stared at Kate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I didn't ask for your son's life, so stop blaming everything on me," she said before turning and walking away. But Kate's cool voice echoed from behind her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Miller, did my son hurt you?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That day, Eva had told Paul, "You know what you did wrong, so why make me be the one to confront you? Can't you at least save some face?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The implied meaning of her words clearly indicated that Paul had done something to hurt her. Kate wasn't entirely sure, but she decided to probe further, causing Eva to pause in her tracks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mrs. Evans, you should go ask your son about this matter," Eva said before walking away briskly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ryan would be able to walk tomorrow, so she needed to quickly pick out the best functional wheelchair. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kate watched Eva's diminishing figure for a few seconds before swiftly turning around and heading back to the hotel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon returning to the hotel, Kate's first action was to use her bag to hit Paul, who was lying motionless on the bed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Paul, you jerk! It was clearly your fault, yet you made me take the blame?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For the past few days, she had thought their breakup was her fault for meddling, but little did she know that Paul was the one who had wronged Eva first!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul, still lying on the bed, heard her words and furrowed his brows slightly, but he couldn't be bothered to respond to Kate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing that he continued to ignore her, Kate approached and grabbed his ear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I just went to ask Eva if you did something to upset her, and she told me to come back and ask you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is basically admitting that you did something to upset her. Tell me clearly, what happened?!" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul, utterly confused, looked at Kate with innocent eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"When did I do something to hurt her?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After they broke up, he hadn't been with anyone else, so how could he have upset her?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You better think hard if you got drunk and messed around with some other woman," Kate said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's impossible!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul wanted to deny it, but in that moment, he remembered getting drunk a while ago.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, after waking up in his apartment, there was no woman lying next to him. It couldn't be true, right?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing her son's frozen expression, Kate knew that Paul, who had a reputation for being a player, had indeed done something to upset Eva.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She angrily let go of Paul's ear and, with a mix of frustration and resentment, pointed at his nose, scolding him harshly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You, with your unchanging playboy ways, shouldn't have proposed so casually. Now, not only do I have to apologize to others, but your dad has also lost so many valuable collections!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Pushing away Kate, who continued to berate him, Paul quickly reached into his pocket and pulled out his phone. He scrolled through his contacts and found Anthony's number.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony, seeing Paul's call, groggily answered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anthony, last month, at the gathering where I announced my engagement, were you the one who drove me home on the night I chose Eva?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony, with one hand supporting his temple, furrowed his brows and thought for a long time before shaking his head...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't remember... Aren't you good at holding your liquor? Why would you need me to drive you home?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yeah, Paul had a high tolerance for alcohol and had never been drunk enough to need Anthony to drive him home. But that night, he was so happy and drank too much, which is why he didn't remember how he got home.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul ended the call and quickly dialed his assistant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Immediately pull up the surveillance footage from the night of the 27th last month when I left the hotel."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His assistant was efficient and quickly retrieved the footage, sending it to Paul.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Paul saw Elsie's figure appear in the video, his heart sank, and Kate, who was next to him, became even more furious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"See, it was your own fault!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul continued watching the surveillance footage and saw himself passed out on the ground, with Elsie helping him into the car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, it turned out that Elsie was the one who drove him home...</span></p></div>
