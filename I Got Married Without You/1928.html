        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ryan lowered his gaze and looked into Amelia's eyes, which reflected his own face.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't help but lose focus for a moment, but he knew she didn't belong to him anymore.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He suppressed the throbbing in his heart and spoke with pain, "No."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia found it hard to accept, "Didn't we promise to be together forever? Why are we separating?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva said James was her husband, and the doctor also said Mr. Evans was her husband.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the person she wanted to marry the most was Ryan. How did it end up being someone else?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ryan's fingers, held tightly by Amelia, gradually curled up.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After struggling in his heart, he gently pushed away Amelia's hand and said, "I don't love you anymore..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though he knew he had lost his memory and that many things had happened during that time, Amelia was still very sad to hear those words. "Ryan, you promised to love me forever, so I don't believe this excuse."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I will love you forever, but you won't," Ryan didn't say these words out loud, he just comforted her, "You will meet someone who loves you more than I do. When he comes back and you see him, you will understand why we separated."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia looked at Ryan's reddened eyes and seemed to understand something.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She lowered her head slowly and said, "So it was because I fell in love with someone else that we separated."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ryan opened his lips, wanting to say something, but a tall figure, supported by Andrew and Peter, stumbled into the ward.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva didn't inform James, it was the doctor who did.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When the man received the call, he was still kneeling in front of the shrine, praying to the heavens.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By the time he heard the news of Amelia waking up, his knees were already unable to support him, and he had to rely on Andrew and Peter to help him back to the hospital.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The doctor didn't tell James that Amelia had lost her memory, only that she had woken up.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, seeing Amelia wake up, James, who had been tense for the past six months, suddenly relaxed.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The despair in his calm blue eyes was replaced by a renewed hope for life.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He pushed away Andrew and Peter's hands, leaned against the door frame, straightened his body, and endured the pain in his knees.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Step by step, he walked towards Amelia.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps he was too happy, he didn't even notice that Amelia was holding onto Ryan's hand tightly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In her affectionate and tired eyes, there was only room for that pale face.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He reached out his trembling fingers and touched Amelia's face.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When his fingertips touched her warm skin, the man finally curved his lips and revealed a relieved smile.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Amelia, you finally woke up."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Overwhelmed with emotions, James couldn't contain himself.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He bent down, wanting to hug her, to kiss her, but before his lips could touch her forehead, she pushed him away in fear.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I... I don't know you."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia's words made James's body stiffen.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it weren't for his hands supporting him on the hospital bed, he might have collapsed to the ground.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You... don't know me?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia had already guessed that he was James when he came in, but she was sorry to say that she had no recollection of him. He felt like a stranger to her.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She couldn't even understand why she had married him and had a child with him. So when he tried to kiss her, Amelia was scared and avoided him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She lost her memory and only remembers you from before she turned eighteen," Ryan explained.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing his voice, James looked away, intending to glance at Ryan, but he saw their hands clasped together.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feeling James's horrified gaze, Ryan wanted to push Amelia away, but she held onto him tightly, as if she would die without him, gripping him so tightly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Staring at their hands, James's joy in his heart was gradually shattered. A chill spread from head to toe, even his blood turned cold.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, she only remembers you and not me?" James asked, but Ryan didn't answer. Amelia's tight grip on his hand had already given him the answer.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James couldn't help but smile helplessly, a smile filled with despair, trembling, and with red eyes...</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Why did Amelia wake up and only remember Ryan, but forget about him? Wasn't he the person she loved the most in her deepest memories?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm sorry."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing the despair in his eyes, Amelia's heart ached, but because she couldn't remember anything, all she felt was guilt towards him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James, like a statue, propped himself up on the hospital bed, with the woman he had been intimately close with for over a decade lying beneath him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But because she didn't remember him, she apologized to him...</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He smiled again, a smile that made his heart ache and tighten, a smile that almost brought tears to his eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But as a strong man, how could he show weakness in front of another man? Even if it hurt, he had to grit his teeth and endure it.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's okay..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He nodded with a smile. "As long as you wake up and are fine, even if you don't remember me, it's okay..."</span></p></div>
