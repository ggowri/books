        <h1>Chapter 1873 Amelia, I'm here to take you home</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James seemed to be able to read Matty's mind, his deep eyes scanning the people behind him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Holden and Emelyn's footsteps gradually slowed down, and the others also paused, not taking another step forward. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matty, who was now completely defeated, had no strategies left even if he used Amelia as a threat. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They would wait for James to enter first, then destroy the surveillance cameras and follow him. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had ways to deal with Matty, so it didn't matter if James went in alone. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After entering the password, the square white wall quickly opened from both sides. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James took elegant steps and entered, and the automatic door quickly returned to its original state. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The dark corridor lit up with lights, leading to the elevator. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James walked along the cement path, crossed the corridor, and approached the elevator step by step. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After descending five floors in the elevator, a faint light shone through the glass. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was the incandescent light refracted on the elevator glass from the emergency room, slightly dazzling. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James faced the light and looked at Matty standing in the corridor. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were numerous infrared beams between the two, and if James took one step forward, the hidden bullets would pierce him. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sorry, since we are enemies, I naturally have to be cautious," said Matty with false politeness. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Facing Matty's false politeness, James ignored him and looked around indifferently, beyond the infrared beams. "Where is Amelia?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matty raised his hand and pressed the control panel to open Amelia's room. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia, sitting on the bed, heard the noise at the door and suddenly looked up. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The door was open, but unfortunately, at the moment the door opened, a bulletproof glass door quickly descended. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia was still locked inside, but at this moment, she could see the outside </span><span>environment and James standing in the corridor. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When the door opened, he also looked up and saw her. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their eyes met, and they didn't move. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia stared at James for a while, then forced herself to stand up and walked to the door. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't say anything, just raised her teary eyes and quietly looked at the man whose steps were blocked not far away. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, James seemed to see her longing for him in her eyes, and warmth surged in his heart. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Amelia, I'm here to take you home." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing James' familiar and pleasant voice, Amelia curved her pale lips and showed a gentle and serene smile. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her agreement meant that she was willing to turn back. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So</span><span> this time, no matter what, he would take her away. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James, with a hint of a smile in his dark eyes, looked at Amelia for a long time before reluctantly shifting his gaze to Matty across from him. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Release her, and I will tell you everything I know." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When James looked at Matty, the tenderness in his eyes evaporated, replaced by a chilling gaze. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"From your tone, it seems that you have more information than just the founder of S organization?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I know who killed your wife." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matty's heart suddenly tightened. "How do you know?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, James didn't reply, just looked at the woman standing behind the glass door. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Release her first." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing the handsome and noble face in front of him, Matty suppressed his eagerness to know the truth and continued to restrain James. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"At this point, it's difficult for me and her to repair our relationship. I will definitely give her back to you. Just say it." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From Matty's words, it seemed that he had made up his mind to perish together with the founder of S organization, which was why he said such resolute words. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now that he had completely fallen and was defeated, the only way left for Matty was to perish together. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James spoke in a low and cold voice, stating unrelated facts. "The person who cruelly killed Sophia is Daley's father, Bernard, the organizer of darkness."</span></p></div>
