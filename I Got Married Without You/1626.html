        <h1>Chapter 1626 You seduced me first</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing how uncomfortable she was, almost on the verge of vomiting, Paul gritted his teeth and coolly looked at Mandy. "You go out first." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mandy glanced at Paul, then at Eva, feeling worried but also tactful, turned around and left. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After the door closed, Paul took off his clothes and pants, originally intending to take a shower himself. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, when he saw Eva's head almost falling into the trash can, he couldn't help but step forward and support her body. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva felt uncomfortable and struggled, trying to push away the person holding her. However, she was embraced by him and then placed in the bathtub... </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The warm water spread around, and Eva felt comforted, no longer struggling. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul fetched the toiletries and helped Eva clean her lips and face. He then thought about taking a shower himself, but Eva held onto his waist and pressed her face against his abs... </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man bent over, holding the wet woman in his arms. After looking at each other for a while, he suddenly lay down in the bathtub and then, from the side, embraced Eva... </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He sniffed the scent of alcohol on her body, resting his chin on her shoulder. "Eva, do you know who I am..." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Eva vomited and became slightly sober, she slightly raised her head and looked at the man embracing her... In her blurry vision, she murmured, "Paul..." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wanted to ask how he ended up here, but her chin was lifted by the man's finger. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul felt somewhat happy, lowered his head, and approached her. "Eva, remember, tonight you seduced me first." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Huh? </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Eva could ask her question, her red lips were sealed, and he passionately kissed her, overwhelming her with intensity... </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His hands around her waist couldn't stay still either, wandering on her skin. Even through the thin fabric, she could feel the scorching heat, like a spark in the mountains, igniting upon contact. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Staring at the handsome face in front of her, Eva was stunned and, perhaps due to the alcohol, she didn't push him away. Instead, she allowed him to touch her without restraint. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When she finally came to her senses and wanted to struggle, Paul had already taken off her clothes. With his head slightly lowered, he once again kissed her upper lip, releasing a faint fragrance between their lips and teeth. "Eva, I haven't touched you for over two years. If I touch you this time, will you marry me?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marry her... </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva's mind was much duller than usual, and she didn't react for a while, just staring blankly at the man making that promise... </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She neither responded nor reacted, like a confused little deer, nestling in his arms, so nervous that she didn't know where to put her hands... </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing her like this, Paul wanted her even more. "If you don't speak, I'll take it as you've agreed." Without giving Eva a chance to respond, he held onto her waist and pressed her beneath him. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The bathtub was quite large, enough for two people. Paul didn't plan on moving elsewhere and, leaning down, he once again captured her lips... </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two of them were always in sync in bed, one passionate like fire, the other responding based on instinct... </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They hadn't touched each other for over two years, and once they were in sync, it was like a wild beast encountering its prey, unstoppable... </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Compared to Eva, who had been drinking, Paul was sober to death. When he experienced that extreme sensation, his eyes seemed to be about to burst into flames. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He lifted Eva's fair thigh, wrapped it around his waist, and thrust forcefully. When he heard her moan, he increased the intensity... </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva, whose mind was filled with alcohol, didn't know anything. She just clung to his back, scratching it like a kitten at a door, scratching that firm back... </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ouch, be gentle." She sobbed, but in response, the man increased the force of his thrusts. It was as if he was torturing her to death, making her cry out, before he became gentle... </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After taking her once, Paul, like a child asking for candy, bit her earlobe and asked, their ears rubbing against each other, "Eva, how does it feel?"</span></p></div>
