        <h1>Chapter 1752 Amelia, come closer</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When they returned to the room, they found themselves in a bewildering environment, surrounded by high walls. Even if they wanted to communicate with the scar-faced man in room 10, they couldn't cross the thick walls.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia and Johnny sat on the edge of the bed, staring at the handcuffs on their wrists. After a while, Amelia felt some discomfort in her abdomen, probably a reaction from running.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Johnny, my stomach hurts, I need to take some medicine."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was a bit nervous, stood up, and pulled Johnny to the corner. Enduring the discomfort, she squatted down, opened the suitcase, and took out some medication. She quickly took a pill and swallowed it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Johnny picked up the medicine box and, after reading what was written on it, was completely stunned. "You're pregnant?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia nodded lightly. "I'm over three months pregnant, and the fetus is a bit unstable, so I occasionally feel uncomfortable."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After she finished speaking, she took the medicine box from him, put it back in the suitcase, and then leaned against the wall, trying to get up and return to bed to rest, but Johnny grabbed her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What are you doing?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing the anger in his eyes, Amelia felt a little scared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Johnny held her hand tightly until five finger marks appeared on her pale skin, then he let go. He seemed angry and accusing as he said, "You're pregnant, why didn't you tell me earlier?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia was puzzled. "I'm pregnant, why should I tell you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Johnny's expression changed, and he fell silent for a moment, as if he had just realized that he had no right to question her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After staring at Amelia for a long time, he slowly controlled his temper and said coldly, "You should have told me earlier. I would never have allowed you to come to this kind of place."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia knew he was worried about her and couldn't help but smile. "Don't worry, I can handle it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is he worth you going through all this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Johnny asked this, there was an indescribable look in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia couldn't understand it, so she just smiled at him. She didn't say anything, but it was already the best answer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia never needed to express her love for James in words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Amelia like this, Johnny was a little angry, but he didn't show it on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're so foolish."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He pulled Amelia up, pushed her onto the bed, and even bent down to help her take off her shoes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia was stunned for a moment, quickly pulled her feet back, and looked at him with a hint of surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't look at me like that. I only see you as a vulnerable group, I'm not interested in you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though he saw her as a vulnerable group, she wasn't weak enough to need his help taking off her shoes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can do it myself."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Whatever."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Johnny let go of her feet, lay down on the bed, and stared at the ceiling in a daze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After taking off her shoes with one hand, Amelia glanced at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Johnny, thank you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Today, he had risked his life to help her, and she should thank him no matter what.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Johnny didn't know what he was sulking about, so he simply closed his eyes and ignored Amelia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't nag anymore and lay down quietly in the adjacent position.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was very tired, and after taking the medicine, she had only been lying down for a short time before her eyes started to close...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she was about to fall asleep, Johnny moved closer and whispered, "Amelia."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His clear and cold voice made Amelia slightly tense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She slowly opened her eyes and looked at the person calling her name.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wished it was James, but unfortunately it wasn't.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She suppressed her hope and responded to him with a soft "Hmm."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come closer."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Johnny had something to tell her, but he was afraid of being monitored, so he asked her to come closer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Enduring her exhaustion, Amelia moved closer to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Johnny looked at the distance between them and felt it wasn't close enough, so he leaned in directly to her ear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His actions were a bit reckless, and as he leaned in, his thin lips accidentally touched Amelia's ear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It could be said that they kissed, and it was exactly eight o'clock...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cobra, who had just infiltrated the program room, happened to see this scene on the surveillance screen.</span></p></div>
