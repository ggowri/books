        <h1>Chapter 1198 I'll kill Amelia as soon as I get out of prison</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, A</span><span>melia</span><span> finally realized how difficult it was for J</span><span>ames</span><span>, who was forced to marry E</span><span>mily</span><span>, back then.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She looked at </span><span>hi</span><span>s profile and saw that he didn't react at all, just coldly watching G</span><span>loria</span><span> go crazy, so she didn't say much.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>S</span><span>tella</span><span> had said that G</span><span>loria</span><span> had a mental illness, and a little stimulation would make her behavior abnormal. What was happening now was probably a symptom of her illness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>G</span><span>loria</span><span> cursed for a long time until J</span><span>ames</span><span> raised his hand and the prison guard came in and gave her an injection in her arm. Her emotions gradually calmed down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she still refused to give up and accused J</span><span>ames</span><span> with weak and vicious words:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You knew that your brother's wish was to marry E</span><span>mily</span><span>, but you didn't help him fulfill it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>J</span><span>ames</span><span> stood outside the door, expressionless, looking through the clean glass at the woman who was tied to a wheelchair and had no strength to struggle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If my brother knew that I had feelings for someone else, he would never have forced me to marry E</span><span>mily</span><span>. All of this is just you binding me and shackling me with moral constraints."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>G</span><span>loria</span><span> sneered, and as she laughed, her eyelids, which were wrinkled and drooping, suddenly lifted, revealing eyes that were red with bloodshot veins.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A</span><span>melia</span><span> saw those eyes under the eyelids, which were so red that they were filled with bloodshot veins, and her heart trembled with fear again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>J</span><span>ames</span><span>'s mother was so terrifying with just one look, and she didn't know how terrifying her methods of torturing people could be.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sensing that A</span><span>melia</span><span> was a little scared, J</span><span>ames</span><span> lowered his head and comforted her, "Don't be afraid, I'm here. She can't hurt you for the rest of her life..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A</span><span>melia</span><span> nodded slightly, tightened her grip on his arm again, as if getting closer to him would give her a sense of security.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sweet and harmonious scene of the two people, in Gloria's eyes, was like a needle </span><span>and a thorn, making her uncomfortable and wanting to tear apart the arms of the two people holding each other!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Why is it that her son died, while Ashley's son can have everything - the position of heir, beloved person, and a happy and fulfilling life? Why is it that her son is lying in the cold hell?!!!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gloria gritted her teeth and glared fiercely at James, "Just wait, when I get out of prison, I will definitely tear your wife's body into pieces!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was this fear of being stalked by a hungry wolf that made Amelia scared, as if Gloria would break through the glass and come out to strangle her in the next second.</span></p></div>
