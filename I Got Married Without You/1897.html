        <h1>Chapter 1897 Zenith and Gigi’s story</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Later, Zenith followed his heart and willingly became a substitute for someone else, as entrusted in his dream. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He became Zack, liked the things Zack liked, and fully embraced Zack's identity. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, there were many times when he questioned himself whether he was Zack or Zenith. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Years later, Gigi, who had already given birth to two children with Zenith, suddenly realized that he was not Zack. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Like encountering a ferocious beast, she fled from him and refused to see him again. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zenith no longer questioned his identity as Zack or Zenith, but knelt before Gigi, repeatedly telling her that he was Zack, a Zack who had lost his memory, and begged her not to leave him. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Gigi had already recognized who the person in front of her truly was. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, she had unknowingly fallen in love with Zenith, someone other than Zack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a terrifying realization. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She felt guilty towards Zack, as she had promised to love only him for the rest of her life. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How could she easily fall in love with someone else and even have children with them? What should she do about her Zack? </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gigi was tormented by guilt and felt that her life was not happy. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, having Zenith by her side in a different form of Zack brought her a sense of warmth. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Life was always complicated and full of entanglements, but one must continue living. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gigi still prayed in front of the church, hoping to meet Zack again in the next life, promising not to mistreat him this time. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gigi's life remained at this point. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that time, she still saw Zenith as Zack, and Zenith, because of that dream, loved </span><span>Gigi openly. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were still in a sweet and loving relationship. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When James and Amelia saw them, Zenith was adding a little honey to the honey water and stirring it with a spoon. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He handed it to Gigi and said, "Pay attention to your diet these days." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gigi took the glass made of glass and placed it to her lips. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After taking a small sip, she smiled at Zenith and said, "Zack, honey water made by you is always delicious." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For Zenith, every time Gigi called him Zack, his heart would tremble uncomfortably. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, he accepted it willingly, saying, "If you like it, then next time you feel unwell, come to me and I'll make it for you." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gigi smiled, stood up, leaned over the bamboo table, and kissed Zenith's cheek. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zenith lowered his gaze and continued to brew tea, saying, "If I didn't have a religious heart, I wouldn't have met you. If I hadn't met you..." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then I wouldn't have to be Zack for my whole life." Zenith didn't say those words, but he smiled bitterly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He covered the teapot and reached out to touch Gigi's face, saying, "Since I met you, you must not escape from me in the future." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gigi casually replied, "I've finally found you. How could I run away? I will stay by your side and cling to you for the rest of my life. We'll have two more children, and then you will never leave me again..." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zenith knew that she wanted to have children for Zack. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't help but smile bitterly, but he agreed. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as he finished speaking, he saw two people standing outside the door. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man was handsome and noble, and the woman was beautiful. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It could be said that they were the most attractive people Zenith had ever seen. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Especially the man, with his noble appearance and elegant temperament, even when standing casually, he became the most dazzling scenery in the winter. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at the man, Zenith remembered what Johnny had said, that Zack sacrificed himself to protect someone. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although he didn't know the reason, Zenith could guess from bits and pieces of information that the person Zack protected must be someone very important. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And the man standing outside the door must be the person Zack willingly sacrificed himself for, the person Gigi resented and hated. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Gigi resented that person, Zenith couldn't ignore their presence. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He let go of his hand that was caressing Gigi's cheek and looked up, asking, "Are you here to find me or to find Gigi?"</span></p></div>
