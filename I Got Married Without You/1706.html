        <h1>Chapter 1706 An old acquaintance</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia walked upstairs and approached Dylan. Dylan smiled politely at her and opened the door to the study, inviting her in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Miss Clark, please come in."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia stepped inside and was greeted by a clean and tidy study, with wooden floors and furniture. The room was filled with ample sunlight, creating a warm atmosphere.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In this setting, there stood an old man in a white suit with silver hair. He had his back to the door, standing by the window and admiring the beautiful view outside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Grandfather, Miss Clark is here," Dylan said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After inviting Amelia in, Dylan respectfully called out to the old man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matty turned around, his eyes deep and powerful, carrying the weight of experience and wisdom, as he examined Amelia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She also took a moment to observe Matty. Despite his age, he still had the same tall and strong figure as in the downstairs photo, with a radiant and lively appearance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't look like someone in his twilight years; instead, he exuded a mature, dignified, elegant, and composed aura, like that of a middle-aged man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Lawrence, hello," Amelia greeted proactively. Matty then shifted his gaze away from her and looked at Dylan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You can leave now. I'll talk to Miss Clark alone."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing this, Dylan gave Amelia a meaningful look before turning and leaving the study.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once Dylan was gone, Matty's inquisitive gaze returned to Amelia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Miss Clark, what flavor of coffee would you like?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After examining her for a moment, he turned around and walked towards the coffee machine, taking out two clean cups from the side.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia expected him to offer her a seat on the sofa first, but instead, he went straight to asking her about her coffee preferences.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A mocha would be great, thank you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she held the cup, she hesitated for a moment, but Matty turned around and glanced at her once again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feeling the silver-haired handsome gentleman's gaze on her, Amelia couldn't help but feel a bit nervous. Did she say something wrong?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she thought this, Matty's stern face and tense sculpted lines gradually softened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I had an acquaintance who also liked mocha, just like you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia didn't respond to his words and simply watched Matty as he turned around to make the coffee.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You can sit anywhere you like."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Matty seemed a bit stern, Amelia felt that he wasn't too difficult to get along with. On the contrary, he seemed quite friendly. She relaxed and chose a small sofa to sit on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After making the coffee, Matty saw Amelia sitting on the small sofa, with her hands on her knees, looking adorable and obedient. He suddenly became lost in thought for a moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Noticing his puzzled expression, Amelia instinctively glanced at the sofa she was sitting on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is it not allowed to sit here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Holding her notebook, she was about to get up when Matty spoke first.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't have so many rules here. You can sit wherever you want."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, Matty walked over with the coffee and handed it to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Miss Clark, may I ask where you're from?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After standing up to receive the coffee, Amelia politely thanked him and looked at Matty, who was elegantly sipping his own coffee by the desk.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm American."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are there other people in your family?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I have a younger sister."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A sister?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matty narrowed his dark eyes slightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Which sister?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This question made Amelia pause. She felt like he had looked into Skender's background and knew that Skender was part of the Clark family. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, she wasn't sure if he knew everything about Sumasa, so she couldn't answer confidently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As far as I know, there are only four children in the Clark family. Besides Johnny, there's Herb, who is a boy, and then there's Gigi, the only girl."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matty's probing gaze became tinged with suspicion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Miss Clark, you wouldn't happen to not even know the name of your own cousin, </span><span>would you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia's heart skipped a beat. Matty had indeed investigated Skender's background. But even though he knew that the Clark family only had Gigi as a girl, why did he ask her which sister?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Does this mean that Matty had long known about Sumasa's situation, knew that Skender wasn't part of the Clark family, and knew that Skender had a sister? </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But if that's the case, why did Matty only search for Skender and never look for Amelia? Could it be that he also doesn't know who Skender's sister is?</span></p></div>
