        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Later, when Edith mentioned Ryan again, Eva asked her how she could fall in love with him. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Edith said that every time she saw him sitting alone by the window, looking at the sea of flowers, she felt that he was pitiful and lonely. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She believed that when a woman starts to feel sorry for a man, she has already fallen for him, and she follows her heart. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Ryan, who trapped himself in a fortress, could no longer accommodate anyone else in his heart. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His entire life, his world, and everything he had belonged only to Amelia. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though Edith expressed her love, Ryan rejected her and even refused her </span><span>treatment and her presence from now on. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He would rather endure the torment of depression than open his heart again and accept any woman other than Amelia, because he was afraid of forgetting Amelia once again. He attributed all the regrets with Amelia to his own amnesia, so no one and nothing could enter his heart and occupy his memories. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But even if Ryan didn't love Edith, she was still willing to stay by his side. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps she didn't love Ryan as much as she loved Anthony before, but he was a man who made her open her heart again, and that made him unique. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Edith also knew that Anthony was silently waiting for her, but she was someone who found it difficult to turn back. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What could make her turn back were the countless separations and farewells in the years to come. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The affairs of the three of them had completely separated from Amelia's future. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After accompanying Eva, Amelia was led by James back to the Blue Bay Island. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as they got out of the car, they saw Johnny leaning against the front of the car. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The weather was getting colder, and Johnny was wearing a thin black coat, his handsome face drooping, staring at his black boots. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Occasionally, his black hair, which had fallen down, was blown by the wind, swaying in a way that had an indescribable sense of brokenness. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In Amelia's memory, Johnny had always been proud and rarely showed such a desolate expression. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought he had experienced something bad and couldn't help but frown. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Amelia frown at Johnny, James's expression suddenly turned cold. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He held her hand and subconsciously tightened his grip. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ryan was gone and now Johnny appeared. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The former was an existence that James couldn't ignore, and the latter should have been insignificant. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, this latter person had also experienced life and death with Amelia, and their current relationship was comparable to the former. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James, who exuded a strong aura, grabbed Amelia's hand, interlocking their fingers, and walked steadily step by step towards Johnny. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Cousin, we agreed that after Erebus's matter was over, I would invite you to dinner, but I didn't expect you to come to the door before I could send the invitation. Since you're here, let's go in and have a meal together with me and your sister-in-law." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm not your cousin, and you're not my cousin. Don't call me that!" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia, who was standing next to them, saw Johnny swear, and the slight sympathy in her eyes disappeared instantly. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't curse my husband!" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man who intended to teach Johnny a lesson stepped forward as Amelia took a step forward, protecting her behind him. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The slight sourness in his heart gradually dissipated. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My husband is indeed your cousin, and I am your sister-in-law. This is an undeniable fact." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Johnny heard Amelia's words, he was filled with anger, but he suppressed it. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He shifted his gaze away from Amelia's face and looked at James, who had a cold expression. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm here to tell you that Gigi met someone in Barcelona who looks exactly like Zack, except for a small mole in his eyes... But even though she could tell that he wasn't Zack, because of the message Zack left behind, she treated him as Zack..." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, Amelia stood frozen in place. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In Zack's timed messages, he had written a sentence for Gigi: "If you pray in the church for a year and still haven't forgotten me, then I will come to you in a different form." Zack gave Gigi a year to go to the church just to let her continue living, but who could have imagined that someone who looked exactly like Zack would actually appear in this world? </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And this person, so coincidentally, came to Gigi in this form. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Could this be what they called destiny?</span></p></div>
