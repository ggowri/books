        <h1>Chapter 1682 Having a child was more urgent</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing the distinctive footsteps, Neil, lying on the couch, immediately sat up straight. "I'm feeling a bit dizzy, so I'll head back home first."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia: "Neil, didn't you say that if I couldn't finish all the design drawings today, you would stay at my place?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Neil waved his hand while getting up. "Oh, I have my own place. Why would I stay at your place? I'll come back tomorrow. See you later..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But just as he got up, a slender and fair hand suddenly rested on his shoulder and gently pressed him back into place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Whose leg are you planning to break?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Neil glanced at James, who had a blank expression, and quickly forced a stiff smile, revealing a perfectly symmetrical smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course, it would be my own leg that I would break!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A playful smile appeared in James' cold eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I just heard that you were planning to break my leg."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hehe."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Neil foolishly smiled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I definitely didn't say that."</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Neil, like Paul, was able to adapt easily. He automatically fetched a wet wipe and handed it to James.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Evans, wipe your hands."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia had never seen Neil being so tactful before and couldn't help but raise her hand, propping up her chin to watch him perform.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James stared at the bizarre face in front of him for a few seconds before taking the wet wipe, wiping his hands, and then looking away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you talk about me behind my back again, I'll saw off your leg."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After staring at Amelia for a while, James walked around the desk and picked her up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia, who was suddenly lifted up, let out a scream and instinctively hooked her </span><span>arms around the back of his neck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Husband, where are you taking me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James didn't answer her, he just lowered his eyes and looked at her with deep affection.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With just one look, Amelia knew what he wanted to do.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How about waiting until I finish the drawings?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Forget about the drawings for now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Having a child was more urgent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Originally, James didn't want to have a child, but...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he were to face any danger, having a child would give Amelia something to hold onto, and maybe she wouldn't be so devastated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Of course, this was only a possibility. His own plan and determination were to survive in Erebus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia couldn't lose him, and he couldn't lose Amelia. For each other's sake, they had to come back alive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Watching her uncle's figure, Grace, who was crouching on the ground, asked with a hint of curiosity:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Every time my uncle carries my aunt upstairs, it takes a long time for them to come back down. What does he do with my aunt?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you want to know?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After James carried Amelia away, Neil sprawled back on the couch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, I want to know."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Curious Grace eagerly nodded, like a puppy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you want to know, give me $5,000."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grace: ...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the top floor, in the romantic room, Amelia leaned against the wall, panting, with her hands resting on James' broad shoulders.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's gotten into you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not only did he leave work early today, but as soon as he came back, he wanted to make love. Did something happen to him?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James, who was holding Amelia, lifted his chin slightly, revealing a distinct jawline, and looked at her flushed face...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll tell you after we're finished."</span></p></div>
