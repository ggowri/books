        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Johnny</span><span>!" Amelia pounded the glass door with all her might, her fists hitting the wall as the door retracted. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her fists kept coming, despite the pain and blood, but the wall remained unyielding. Exhausted, she slid down the glass, feeling hopeless and defeated. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Johnny</span><span>, I can't break through this wall. I'm sorry, I can't save you..." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia knelt on the ground, staring at the white wall that separated life and death. She felt drained, her body and spirit shattered. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She blamed herself for </span><span>Johnny</span><span>'s death, feeling unworthy and unable to face anyone, especially Gigi. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the mechanical voice announced the end of the game and the preparation for the next round, Amelia remained silent, leaning against the wall. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the control room, 2-7 smiled satisfactorily, watching Cobra. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His blood dripped onto the floor, unnoticed by anyone except 2-7. She seemed pleased with the punishment, as if only this kind of retribution could satisfy her. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now that her male assistant is dead, let's see if she can overcome the final challenge." Leaving with the sound of congratulations for her winning bet, 2-7 walked away, while the other spectators left the viewing area. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cobra remained seated, motionless. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia didn't know how long she sat there, until a mechanical arm helped her up and guided her back to her room. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Johnny</span><span>'s absence in the empty room was a painful reminder of his loss. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Numbly, she approached </span><span>Johnny</span><span>'s bed and slowly opened the drawer. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inside, she found apples, milk, and bread, carefully saved by </span><span>Johnny</span><span> over the past two months. He always left some for her, making sure she didn't go hungry. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She took out the food and began to eat, not tasting anything, consumed by grief. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tears streamed down her face as she realized she was crying for </span><span>Johnny</span><span>. She didn't think she'd ever cry for another man again, but end up being touched by </span><span>Johnny</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She longed to know the question </span><span>Johnny</span><span> wanted to ask and the final message he wanted to convey. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But it was impossible now. </span><span>Johnny</span><span> had taken all the answers with him, leaving her with an overwhelming sense of guilt and confusion. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia sat on </span><span>Johnny</span><span>'s bed all night holding her doubts, carrying her guilt, and holding the last of her apples ......</span></p></div>
