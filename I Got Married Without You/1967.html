        <h1>Chapter 1967 Unwed in Life and Reunited in Death</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Kate who was at fault, yet it was Anthony who bore the consequences. He was innocent. Edith should have been the one to make amends, but she wouldn't give Anthony another chance because of her past. In the end, it was her harshness that stood in the way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sitting outside the crematorium, Edith was nearly consumed with regret. But the man who had loved her all his life would never return to wrap his arms around her, stroke her lengthy hair, and assure her, "Edith, this is just a nightmare. Once you wake up, I'll still be here..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking of this only drove Edith to tears, wailing like a madwoman inside the crematorium, calling out for Anthony, pleading for him to come back. But no one answered her cries. Only the pattering rain, telling her it was all impossible now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She fainted from crying. When she awoke, she saw Kate's concerned face looking down at her. Dazed, she looked around, but Anthony was nowhere to be seen, which brought fresh tears to her eyes...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom, did you drive Anthony away from me again? Is that why he's disappeared?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kate, looking into Edith's swollen eyes, began to cry too. "Edith, Anthony is gone..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Edith suddenly turned her head, staring out the window at the pouring rain, tears streaming down her face. "It was you, you drove me away from him, and you, you killed him..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Edith knew she could only blame herself. After all, it was Kate who had come to a sudden realization and advised her to turn back. She was the one who refused, ultimately wearing down Anthony's health.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't Kate's fault. It was her own, but she couldn't accept that she was the cause of all this. So, she shifted the blame onto Kate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And Kate, admitting her guilt, kept saying, "Yes, it's my fault. I caused the death of Anthony. But Edith, no one signed for Anthony's cremation. You need to pull yourself together, go to the crematorium, and sign the authorization..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Edith shook her head frantically. She felt that by refusing to authorize the cremation, Anthony would still be alive. But Anthony's body was already decomposing in the morgue. It had to be done...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With no other choice, she mustered her strength to go to the crematorium and, with trembling fingers, signed the form. As the workers began to push Anthony into the cremation furnace...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Edith rushed forward, grabbing Anthony's body, burying herself in his embrace, and sobbing. "Anthony, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She apologized repeatedly, not asking for Anthony's forgiveness but hoping his spirit could hear her remorse, her regret, her forgotten love, and her countless unresolved sorrows...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony was cremated amidst Edith's heart-wrenching sobs. The man who had once entered whole was now reduced to a small box of ashes. Previously unable to lift Anthony, Edith could now easily carry him with just her hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Holding his urn, Edith came to Anthony's home, now ruled by Anthony's stepmother, Samantha. Upon seeing Anthony's urn, Samatha found it ominously wrong luck and forbade Anthony from being buried in their family's cemetery. She even had Edith chased away...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps it was the broom that struck Anthony's urn. As Edith turned to leave, she ordered her bodyguards to demolish their house and even had them sever the hands of Samantha.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Edith, a member of the Evans family, naturally inherited their ruthlessness. However, she had never acted maliciously or bullied anyone before. But once provoked, the dormant cruelty of the Evans bloodline erupted uncontrollably...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cradling Anthony's ashes, Edith returned to Arcadia and buried him in the Evans family cemetery. On his tombstone, she inscribed "Beloved Husband, Anthony". They were unmarried in life, but she believed they would united in death. It marked the end of their tumultuous love affair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Years later, Edith lived as she had always said she would. She was unmarried and childless, alone for the remainder of her days.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her funeral was attended by Alexander and a few nieces and nephews. Their names were the only ones left on the tombstone, and they were also the ones who continued to visit the grave each year, a rather sad affair...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The year Alexander turned five, Edith's life had not yet concluded when they received news of Anthony's death. Amelia and James went to see the grave, their emotions a mix of sighs and regrets after experiencing too many losses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Worried about Edith, Amelia, along with Eva, stayed with her for a while, supporting her until she redirected her grief and remorse into her work. Only then did they feel reassured enough to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, they were also afraid that Edith, like Stella, would pretend to be busy and then silently follow Anthony. So, after they left, they had someone constantly keep an eye on Edith.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After observing her for six months, Eva and Amelia saw no signs of Edith planning anything reckless. Relieved, they could finally let their guard down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Anthony's chapter closed, Amelia faced a new challenge as Alexander's increasingly strange behavior compelled her to seek a psychologist.</span></p></div>
