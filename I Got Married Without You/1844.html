        <h1>Chapter 1844: Medicated Simon</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matty led Amelia to the holding room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before the man in black opened the door, Matty turned to Amelia, "When I learned Brandon pushed you in the ocean, I locked them up. They know I'm your granddad. Handle them how you like. No holding back."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia remained silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the door swung open and lights flickered on, Emily was momentarily blinded. When she could see again, she was confronted with a face that mirrored hers, a face she despised. If not for that face, James wouldn't have noticed Amelia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Pity you're still alive. Would've loved a firework celebration," Emily taunted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A guard, upon hearing her words, slapped her across the face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Watch your mouth around our boss!" he snarled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You run Erebus now?" Emily asked Amelia, rubbing her slapped cheek.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia, trailed by men in black, stayed cool. "Disappointed?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Amelia sat down, her pregnancy was clearly visible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One woman held power, the other was chained and pitiful. The contrast fueled Emily's envy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're clueless and useless. How'd you become the boss?" Emily snapped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I did everything for James' love, even dated Simon to get close. How'd you win him over?" she continued.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia's eyes dimmed at Simon's mention. She knew his death was from a med mix-up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I found out in prison that Simon died because James' meds were switched. You did it, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No!" Emily denied, but her guilt was clear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Did you swap the meds to save James from Gloria's plot or to stop Simon getting well and being with James?" Amelia pushed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emily was shocked, recalling when Simon found her switching his meds. However, he was so kind, even comforting her. Then, she admitted to loving James and fearing she couldn't have him if Simon got better.</span></p></div>
