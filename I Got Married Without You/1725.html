        <h1>Chapter 1725 Amelia knew everything</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The light in Amelia's eyes slowly faded away, as if she had been plunged into an endless darkness filled with nothing but despair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her mind was filled with images of James having his skull opened. She didn't know if those people had given him anesthesia, which could at least ease the pain, or if they had just cut him open without any numbing. She couldn't imagine the feeling of having things taken out of his brain piece by piece...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just the thought of James dying in such agony made Amelia's heart feel like it was being ripped in two.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She took big, gasping breaths, but still couldn't catch her breath. The suffocating feeling was unbearable, as if her mouth and nose were blocked and she couldn't even get any air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia winced in pain, clutching her chest and slowly bending over, but the excruciating pain in her heart just wouldn't ease. Tears streamed down her face, drop by drop, hitting the floor...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Holden couldn't help but lift his head when he saw the tears on the ground. What he saw was Amelia's lifeless appearance. In that moment, feelings of guilt and self-blame rushed into his heart, making him unable to look directly at her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My sister asked him to protect me, so he did... "</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking about the way James sacrificed himself for him, Holden buried his head even deeper into his knees.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sorry..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia's ears slowly regained their ability to hear as she looked away from Holden, who had buried his head in his knees, with her eyes red and swollen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So you're saying he chose you, so he doesn't want me anymore."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She almost used all her strength to say these words from her throat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He promised her that he would come back, but he ended up leaving her behind to save someone else.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Should she praise him for his righteousness, or should she hate him for his cruelty?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia's face turned pale, with a touch of endless mockery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But could she blame him for this?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No, she couldn&rsquo;t.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because of her husband risked everything to save others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She released her hand from her chest and wiped away the tears on her face before looking down at Holden, who was still kneeling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Where are his ashes?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No one claimed his body."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Holden clenched his fists tightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We're heading in two different directions, I can't go back..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, he knew that those who accepted punishment would be held down on the operating table by the black-clothed figures hiding behind masks, and have their heads cut in half with a knife from the back of their skulls. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, their insides would be scooped out and thrown into the trash bin, while the remaining body would be kicked into the incineration chute.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he and Mr. Shawn entered the final round of the game, the videos playing on the walls all around them were filled with the fear of death. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This fear often led people to make the wrong choices. The gamblers who entered at the same time as them were no exception. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as the door opened, they were dragged onto the operating table and had their skulls opened and their bodies burned in front of the next participant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the critical moment, he and James were faced with a decision - one made the right choice, while the other made the wrong one. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was prepared to sacrifice himself, but before the door could open, James pushed him aside with lightning speed and was pulled away, not giving Holden any chance at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia's heart sank when she heard that no one was going to claim James's body. Her eyes, hollow and empty, suddenly sparked with a glimmer of hope.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Did you see him being decapitated with your own eyes?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Holden knew that Amelia was expecting something, but...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Before he entered the gates of death, he gave me a deadline of 23 days. If he comes back within that time, it means he succeeded. But if not, it's a sign of misfortune..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, whether he saw it with his own eyes or not, James can't come back anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;But...&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia tried to struggle, but Holden cut off her hope.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mrs. Evans, your husband had everything planned out. The first letter he sent you was through Paul, a month after he left. He wanted to come back to you within that month after completing his mission, but he also knew that it wouldn't be easy to leave Erebus. So he wrote in the letter, asking you to wait for two more months..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But he calculated that he couldn't finish the task within a month, so he knew he wouldn't be able to finish it within two months either. That's why he wrote a second letter, asking Paul to </span><span>deliver it to Ryan after two months. He did this because he was afraid that if he couldn't come back, there would be someone else to take care of you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Holden spoke, his eyes uncontrollably filled with tears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You know, when I came back, I was just like you, hoping that James would come back within 23 days. But he didn't, he never did. That's when I realized, he's not coming back for real..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because he knew James wouldn't be coming back, he chose to be honest when he received Peter's call, instead of following James' request to continue hiding the truth from Amelia or helping him push Amelia towards Ryan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because Amelia rejected Ryan, it's clear that she loved James very much. A woman who loved a man like that had the right to know everything about him.</span></p></div>
