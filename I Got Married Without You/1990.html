        <h1>Chapter 1990 This Body Couldn't Bear It</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the day of Alexander's coming-of-age ceremony, it snowed heavily, just like the day when Amelia woke up from the long coma. It made her so dazed that she stood by the window and forgot to go downstairs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James changed his clothes and came out of the dressing room. Seeing her standing motionless by the window, he couldn't help but stand there as well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked at the figure engraved in his bones from afar, and suddenly, it was like he was back in his youth. She walked towards him in the light with long hair flying. And her bright eyes, like a branding iron, branded into his heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In this life, the most unforgettable thing and the thing he feared the most to forget, was only that figure. However, everyone's life could be long, except his. In less than fifty years, his everything would be taken back...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He did not blame God for being unfair, he just couldn't bear to leave his Amelia. However, no matter how reluctant he was, this body just couldn't bear them. It couldn't bear the affection, deep attachment, and the love that he wanted to carry on into the next life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James smiled helplessly, and forced himself to return to the dressing room. He took out a fluffy coat, and wrapped Amelia's body from behind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Being hugged with both clothes and body, Amelia came back to her senses from her daze. She lowered her long eyelashes and looked at the hands around her waist. She subconsciously raised her fingers to cover them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your hands are much colder than usual."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The weather got colder, so they are naturally colder than usual..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia didn't respond, she just turned her head, and looked up at the man holding her. In her brown pupils, when she saw the still delicate and beautiful face, she couldn't help but want to cry...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Honey, I still have a lot to say to you. Can you... leave a little later?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James was stunned for a moment when he heard this, then slowly loosened his hand around Amelia's waist and placed it on her nose bridge, gently scratching it in a doting way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Silly, I'm right here with you, I'm not going anywhere."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia grabbed James' fingers, then stood on tiptoe, raised her chin, and kissed his lips, which were so cold that they didn't feel like normal temperature...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"James, have I ever told you that I love you very much?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James' heart trembled slightly, but he remained calm and rubbed Amelia's cheek with his nose. "You have said it every day for the past three years. How can you say you haven't said it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every time she said "I love you very much", he would give her a bouquet of roses. They had spent eighteen years in such warmth. How could Amelia bear to let him go? "Honey, I love you very much, so..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you are gone, I will definitely follow you." Amelia didn't say this, but James knew what she wanted to say. He put his finger on her lips in advance and said, "No, just let it be."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it were in the past, the sentence after that should be "only the future", but James did not say that, which indicated something without saying...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia's heart was pounding, and James held her fingers tightly, put them in his palm, then lowered his head and kissed her forehead. "Sweetheart, we can't miss our son's coming-of-age ceremony. We should go."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No matter how scared or confused she was, she still had to do what she had to do. Amelia nodded and let James hold her hand and head towards the snow mountain...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, it was the coming-of-age ceremony for the new president of the Evans Group. Other members of the Evans family, the Lawrence family and the Clark family would all come to congratulate. Even Johnny who was uninvited would come too.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Earlier, when Amelia wanted to go to the snow mountain, James ordered people to build a villa. Now everyone gathered inside, sitting around the fire, tasting delicious food. The adults were talking to each other, and the children were chasing and playing, it was very lively.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was the protagonist of the ceremony, so naturally he had to make a grand appearance. In order to capture her son's most handsome moment, Amelia asked Owen's wife, Stephanie to order an Haute Couture suit in advance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eighteen-year-old Alexander worn this limited edition white suit, which was the only one in the world. He looked handsome and majestic, like an elegant king, worthy of admiration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the expression revealed between his eyes was somewhat similar to that of his father when he was young. He was equally cold as an eagle, yet handsome and extraordinary, with unparalleled elegance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What Alexander inherited was not only James' brain, but also his peerless appearance and gentle demeanor in every move. Even his cold and oppressive aura was perfectly replicated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at her handsome and confident son, Amelia couldn't help but want to cry. She turned around as if nothing had happened, took out the tie, tied it on him, and then carefully helped him adjust his collar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"After twelve o'clock, you will become an adult. And you will have to be on your own in the future."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The best thing Amelia had ever done in her life was to give birth to Alexander. Now seeing him grow up like this, she felt mixed emotions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed that she didn't want her son to grow up, but he had to grow up eventually, just like some people had to leave. It was the same law of nature and there was nothing to fight against.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia's sorrowful look when she lowered her eyes was an indescribable pain for James. He couldn't bear to watch any longer, so he turned around and walked out of the villa, step by step, stepping on the thick snow, moving forward aimlessly...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander responded, "Don't worry, Mom." Then he looked up at the figure walking in the snow outside the window. "Mom, I'll go see Father first..."</span></p></div>
