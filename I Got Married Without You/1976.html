        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul hurriedly waved his hand to deny it, he just wanted to donate some money to the organization. Professional people wouldn't take such money and would firmly refuse any financial gain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing his obstinance, Paul got angry, slamming the table. "No wonder you're bald. All your hair got absorbed by your stubbornness!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The professional was displeased and also slammed the table. "Hey, you can insult my intelligence, but don't insult my hair!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll insult your hair all I want!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as they were about to start fighting, Maxwell held his stomach and shouted, "Dad, my sister and I haven't eaten all day. We're so hungry..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul, full of anger, immediately turned his fury onto Maxwell. "All you two do is eat. Can't you learn from Alexander and eat fewer snacks and read more books?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxwell and Margot shook their heads. "Dad, we can't recognize all the words yet, and we don't like reading. We're only interested in snacks."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing the two kids, the professional immediately seized the opportunity to retaliate. "Look at them, do they look like they have IQ of 130 and 148?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul, speechless, picked up a kid in each hand. "Your institution is doomed to fail!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The professional wondered, "Having done so many IQ tests, this is the first time I've encountered such nonsense. It's infuriating!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before returning to Arcadia, Paul recreated the test results on his computer, printed them out, and took the two kids to brag to James.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"James, look at this. My kids are also very smart, especially my son with an IQ of 148. He could get into Mensa!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James in the study, rapidly typing on the keyboard, didn't even look up and asked Maxwell, "Ken, what's sixty-eight times forty-two?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxwell, munching on potato chips, used his dirty fingers to start calculating. Three minutes later, he gave an answer. "110."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul kicked him. "That's multiplication, not addition. All the stuff I taught you went to your stomach?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ken pouted, and James looked up, giving Maxwell a comforting glance. "Paul, your son is indeed very smart."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul couldn't tell if it was a compliment or a rebuke and slowly retracted his leg. "James, why can't I have a genius like Alexander?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James glanced at him. "Because you're not a genius."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul protested, "I'm a genius in computing!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James ignored him, and Paul walked over. "James, how about we swap sons? You take Maxwell, and I'll take Alexander."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James' typing fingers slowly stopped. "Paul, although your two kids are not geniuses. If you and Eva have time, try for another one."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul was speechless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Damn James!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Full of anger, Paul grabbed his kids and dashed out of James' study at lightning speed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After he left, James picked up the IQ test results on the desk, shaking his head. Paul didn't even change the previous answers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Returning home angrily, Paul forced the kids to sit in the study and read, then started calling professional tutors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, if he couldn't beat them in talent, he would start a rat race!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Little did he know, while he was trying to start a rat race, Alexander was working even harder to escape James' control.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In less than five years, Alexander had left Paul's two kids far behind and had self-taught himself to a point.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Over the years, guided by James, Alexander had learned that there was always someone better. He was no longer as arrogant as before, though he still couldn't help but sneer at really foolish people.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At such times, James would place a large hand on his head and tell him, "Your intelligence is a gift from God. If you can't learn to accommodate those below you, one day, your abilities might be taken away."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After being crushed for five years, Alexander lowered his icy gaze. "Accommodating means listening to their foolish words and helping them solve trivial problems. Over time, I'll get very tired."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He felt his time should be spent on more meaningful things, but James told him, "People with high moral character do get tired. The question is, do you want to be such a person?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander looked up at James. "Can I choose not to be such a person?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James nodded slightly. "Of course you can, but I hope my son can be that kind of person."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My son...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps it was these two words that moved Alexander. After hesitating for a moment, he nodded solemnly at James. "Father, I'll follow your advice and become a noble person."</span></p></div>
