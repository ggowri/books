        <h1>Chapter 1978 A Family of Four</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia returned from the company in the early evening. In the back garden, under the rays of the setting sun, a straight-backed man holding a knife was teaching Alexander how to use it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wanted to greet them but didn't want to ruin the moment, so she paused at the doorway, leaning slightly and gazing at the large and small figures on the lawn in the twilight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man who didn't want to be involved in the child's upbringing was now spending his time and energy to help the child succeed. Because of this effort, he earned the child's admiration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James was a good husband and a qualified father. With him around, their home was warm and meaningful. She hoped this wonderful man would accompany her and their child for a lifetime.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps sensing her intense gaze, James turned his head slowly against the light. His once sharp eyes had grown softer with age.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, his finely chiseled features remained unchanged, as if time couldn't leave any marks on his face, still as unforgettable as when they first met.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James stood tall in the sunlight, wearing a black shirt and trousers, with a white waistband. His fingers, clearly defined, were tucked into either side of his waist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His hair was neatly combed back, swaying slightly as he tilted his head to beckon Amelia over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia smiled, walked over, took the handkerchief from Peter, and approached James. "Honey, bend down."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James obediently bent down a bit. Amelia stood on tiptoe and wiped his sweat with the handkerchief. "What do you want for dinner?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James reached out, wrapped his arm around Amelia's waist, and pulled her closer to his chest. "Ms. Garcia, are you going to cook yourself?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia wasn't annoyed by his teasing. Instead, she lifted her small face with a happy smile. "Can you stop calling me that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For the past five years, Amelia hadn't been idle. She established her own architectural design company, taking on only a few projects and spending most of her time at home with James and Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But James thought even that was too much, always teasing her, causing her to avoid taking on too many projects over the past two years. Only recently had she been busier, and every time she wasn't home, he would tease her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James with one hand around Amelia and the other taking the handkerchief from her, said, "You're a famous designer now, with more people seeking you out than me. If I don't call you Ms. Garcia, what should I call you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia, looking at James wiping sweat, laughed and linked her arm through his. "Alright, I'll cook dinner myself tonight and make your favorite dishes to satisfy you, okay?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James' gaze shifted past Amelia's arm. "That is not enough to satisfy me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia sighed, "Then what do you want to do?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James, staring at her smooth neck, raised an eyebrow slightly. "I will do whatever you want me to do."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing the implication in his words, Amelia, feeling shy, glanced at Alexander. "Alexander is still here. What are you talking about?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beside them, Alexander was wiping the knife with a cloth, already used to his parents' affectionate behavior, not even looking at them. "Mom, whether I'm here or not, it won't stop my father from being flirtatious."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia burst into laughter. "My son is amazing. Only five years together and you already know what kind of person your dad is."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James pinched Amelia's smiling cheek and then turned his head slightly to look at Alexander, who was lowering his head to wipe the knife. "Massage the knife ten times."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander paused, bewildered, and looked up. "Massage the knife?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James didn't respond, just held Amelia's waist and turned to leave, leaving the confused Alexander looking between the knife in his hand and James' upright back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia changed her clothes and went to the kitchen to cook a sumptuous dinner. Today, Grace was coming home from school, so she and the chef prepared many of Grace's favorite dishes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By the time she finished, Alexander and James had showered and come to the dining room. Just as they sat down, Grace's clear, ringing voice came from the living room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aunt Amelia, James, I'm back!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the three turned around, a slender figure entered the door. Grace wore a white blouse and gray skirt, exuding a youthful charm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She looked like a school heroine from a movie, with a high ponytail and a slightly raised chin, revealing a touch of naivety but also an undeniable beauty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After entering high school, Grace's baby fat faded away, and as she grew older, she became more and more like Skender. Her figure and face were also good.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After dropping her shoulder bag and handing it to Frank at the door, she walked confidently and cheerfully into the dining room, smiling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, I won the high school debate championship today!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grace walked over, gave Amelia a perfunctory hug, and then stretched out her hand to Alexander. "One hundred thousand dollars, give it to me now!"</span></p></div>
