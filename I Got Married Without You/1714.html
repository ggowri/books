        <h1>Chapter 1714 Packing Baggage</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It rained all night without stopping, and it wasn't until the next morning that it finally drizzled away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James lowered his gaze and stared at the woman in his arms. After a moment, he slowly released her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought Amelia was asleep, so he lifted the covers, grabbed his clothes, and tiptoed out of the room...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia, lying on her side in bed, opened her eyes and gazed at the tall and imposing figure in front of her...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She heard him remind Frank to take good care of her, and also heard him remind Peter to protect her. He also instructed Grace to listen to her words while he was away...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was saying his final goodbye, and Amelia knew it. But compared to ten days ago when she cried and made a fuss, she was much calmer now. It seemed like she had already accepted the fact that he was leaving.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After lying down for a while, she got up and went to the bathroom to freshen up. Then she sat down at the vanity and applied a light makeup for herself. After that, she grabbed her suitcase and headed to James' dressing room...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After finishing his call with Paul, James returned and saw a silver suitcase on the floor of the dressing room. A woman was crouched next to the suitcase, her back facing him as she carefully placed folded clothes inside, one by one...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As James watched the slender and delicate figure walking away, his heart inexplicably ached and his feet froze in place, unable to move...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia wasn't sure how long had passed when she finished organizing her suit and shirt. As she got up to straighten her suit pants, she caught a glimpse of the man behind her in the full-length mirror.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she reached for his pants, her hand hesitated for a moment before pushing down the sadness in her heart. She turned around and smiled at James, "Honey, I'm helping you pack your luggage. Is there anything special you want to bring? Just let me know and I'll pack it for you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James lowered his thick, vertical eyelashes to cover his reddened eyes, and took a step </span><span>towards her, pulling her into his arms. "I didn't plan on bringing anyone," he said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia could feel the reluctance in his embrace, but she held back her heartache and pushed him away. "You go take care of your business first, I'll finish organizing these things and then come find you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James thought to himself, it would be best to leave these tasks to the servants, but deep down he knew that Amelia just wanted to do something for him one last time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't bring himself to stop her, so he just replied with a simple "Okay."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia gave him a gentle smile and said, "Then you should go and attend to other things quickly..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She pushed him away, not wanting him to see the tears in her eyes. Since they were destined to part ways, she wanted to bid farewell in the best possible way and let the other person leave without any regrets.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As James looked at Amelia, he struggled to control his emotions and clenched his fists tightly. He made the tough decision to leave the dressing room, but as he turned around, he saw tears welling up in Amelia's eyes. They fell onto his clean and tidy suit pants, slowly accumulating and dampening the fabric.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James stood on the second floor hallway, looking back at the dressing room. He wanted to run back and tell Amelia that he wasn't leaving, that he would stay with her for the rest of his life. But his rationality stopped him from doing so...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul arrived at Blue Bay Island and happened to see James standing on the second floor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"James, why did you call me to your house so early?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His voice snapped James out of his thoughts, causing the man to release his tightly clenched fist and quickly turn to walk downstairs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Go to the study.'</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul couldn't help but feel a sense of unease as he noticed James' serious expression. Last time, James had mentioned leaving for a while and promised to tell him where he was going before he left. Could it be that James was actually leaving?</span></p></div>
