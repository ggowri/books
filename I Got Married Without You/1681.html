        <h1>Chapter 1681 To protect Amelia</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"James, you're acting so strange today. Why did you distribute the shares like this? And why train me to be in charge, and have us protect Amelia?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James crossed the office and sat down on the leather swivel chair, then looked up at a puzzled Paul.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In a month, I have to go somewhere and I might not be able to contact you for a while, so I had to make these arrangements. As for why I'm training you to be in charge..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He paused for a moment, and his long, thick eyelashes twitched slightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He originally had two more months, but this morning he received a message...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This message forced him to move up the timeline.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that in mind, James looked up and continued in a cold voice:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You and Amelia both have a 30% stake, but Amelia can't be involved in the company, so I'm entrusting you with the power. You and her need to work together, with the help of your brothers, to help Amelia and balance the power of the Evans Family."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James could predict that once he's gone, both Sir Evans and the rest of the Evans Family will likely shift their focus to Amelia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To ensure that Amelia was financially secure for the rest of her life, he needed to help her receive dividends from the Evans' shares and found a way to eliminate any obstacles for her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And that could only be achieved with the support and loyalty of his brothers, especially Paul, who had been by his side since childhood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Where are you going then?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul frowned and asked, understanding his intentions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is it NASA again?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every time he goes to NASA, he hands over his phone and loses contact with them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No," James denied, interrupting Paul before he could speak again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll tell you before I leave."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There's so much more he needed to explain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul hesitated, wanting to ask further, but James became impatient.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Miller is pregnant, go back and spend more time with her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had no choice but to close his mouth, leaving the president's office with a heart full of questions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Paul left, James' gaze darkened and he took out his phone, opening the message.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[James, it's Emily.]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Below the message was a photo of Amelia sitting in the study, diligently drawing design sketches.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This meant that Emily, who joined Erebus with Mr. Ben, was monitoring them at all times.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It also meant that she was using Amelia as leverage against him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for her purpose in threatening him, he didn't know...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All he knew was that this time at Erebus, besides uncovering the mastermind, he also needed to find a way to eliminate them completely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that in mind, James tightened his grip on the phone, and his eyes, shining like stars in the night sky, gradually became covered by a cold mist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After handling these matters, James left the company ahead of schedule and quickly returned to Blue Bay Island.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia was drawing design sketches, and on the opposite couch, Neil was throwing French fries into Grace's mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grace was like a little puppy, catching the fries wherever they were thrown. But after catching for a while, she hadn't caught a single fry, and her drool had made a mess on the floor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Amelia saw this, she glared at Neil, "Neil, can't you treat my sister's child better?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Neil didn't care at all and continued to throw peanuts into Grace's mouth, "I'm cultivating her reflexes."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia was speechless, "If you want to cultivate her reflexes, take her to play basketball."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grace, hearing this, protested, "Auntie, I don't want to play basketball. I like playing these kinds of games."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Grace's support, Neil immediately spread his hands, "See, she's doing it willingly, not because I'm forcing her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia said, "Wait until Grace's uncle comes back and sees how you treat her like this. He'll definitely break your leg."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Neil scoffed, "Hmph, he's worse with Grace than I am. If he breaks my leg, I'll break his leg too."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before he could finish his sentence, the study door was pushed open by a servant, and James, emitting a cold aura, walked in from outside as if he owned the place.</span></p></div>
