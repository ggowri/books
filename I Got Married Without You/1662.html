        <h1>Chapter 1662 Kate threatened Elsie</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her talent for eloquence is really impressive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're doing this just to anger Eva."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Facing Kate's revelation, Elsie remained composed, furrowing her brows and pretending to look confused.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What does this have to do with Eva?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kate put down her cup and stared coldly at Elsie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You went to Paul's apartment right after Ms. Miller arrived. You must have known she was coming and staged a performance for her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elsie pretended to understand, pondered for a moment, then raised her head and looked straight into Kate's eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I bumped into Paul on the way and gave him a ride home. I had no idea Ms. Miller was coming."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kate remembered that she went to Paul's apartment after talking to Eva that night.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her timely visit to Paul indicated that she went to break up with him as she said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, Eva seeing Paul and Elsie 'sleeping together' was because of her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Kate realized this, she couldn't come up with any other arguments and remained silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If I didn't even know if she was coming, why would I be angry at her?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And even if I wanted to use this incident to anger Ms. Miller afterwards, it would definitely leave a trace of me contacting her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You can go ask Ms. Miller if I contacted her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If I didn't, then you're purposely framing me for trying to find evidence like this."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kate's face darkened at her words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can't figure out what your real intentions are, but I know I won't let you off easily for smearing Paul."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Kate raising her chin at the bodyguard again, Elsie grew fearful and shouted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I didn't smear Paul. He really slept with me, please don't force me to confess!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kate ignored her, the coldness in her eyes directly shifting to the bodyguard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Keep going until she confesses!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then followed a series of punches and kicks, leaving Elsie battered and bruised, but she still refused to admit it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I didn't smear Paul. He really slept with me. Why won't you believe it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing this, Kate ordered the bodyguard to continue beating her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, Elsie was left barely conscious, but still didn't change her story.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you forcing me like this because Ms. Miller found out about Paul and me, and you want to help Paul win her back, so you're trying to make me say he didn't do it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lying on the ground, Elsie, with a face covered in blood, stared back at Kate defiantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kate, shaken by Elsie's unexpected response, couldn't quite tell the truth from the lie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Kate remained unmoved, giving a cold glance at Elsie, who was curled up in pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My son said he didn't sleep with you, so he definitely didn't!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, Elsie sneered inwardly but put on an innocent face, crying out:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just because Paul said he didn't sleep with me, does that mean it's the truth?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her rhetorical question momentarily startled Kate, and Elsie seized the opportunity to continue:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is it possible that Paul simply doesn't remember, or he remembers but is afraid of losing Ms. Miller after she found out, so he's saying he didn't sleep with me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After contemplating for a moment, Kate stood up from the couch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She walked step by step towards Elsie, gracefully crouched down, and then extended her pristine white fingers to lift Elsie's repulsive face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their eyes locked onto each other, and suddenly, a touch of wickedness flashed in Kate's eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As long as you admit that you didn't have any relationship with Paul, then your parents can enjoy their old age peacefully. But if you don't admit it, I'm afraid they won't survive this winter..."</span></p></div>
