        <h1>Chapter 1629 You should take responsibility</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva secretly glanced at him in the mirror and felt relieved when she saw that he had put on clothes. But as he walked towards her, she couldn't help but feel anxious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If they hadn't slept together, she could still face him calmly like before. But after sleeping together, things felt different. It was like being tied up, making her extremely uncomfortable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She held her breath as Paul approached, his slender hands wrapping around her waist from behind, holding her tightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She stiffened, while Paul acted naturally, resting his chin on her shoulder. "Eva, you </span><span>were the one who seduced me last night. Since you were the one who seduced me, you should take responsibility."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She seduced him first?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva's face turned red and she tugged at her lips. "I was drunk, I don't remember..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In other words, she didn't remember anything, and she didn't want to take responsibility.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Paul's hand on her waist slowly moved upwards, Eva's weakened body struggled to find a firm position.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you don't remember, then let me help you remember," he said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva didn't know if she was at fault or just nervous. After swallowing her saliva, she grabbed the wandering hand. "Forget it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She held onto his hand, preventing Paul from touching her, and turned to look at him. "Tell me, how should I take responsibility?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing these words, a satisfied smile slowly appeared on Paul's lips. "Marry me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marry him...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she didn't want to go through marriage again, especially not with Paul.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Reluctance filled her face, and Paul noticed it. He felt a bit sad, but pretended not to know, reaching out to grab Eva's face and make her look directly at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Eva, you agreed to marry me last night. So, now you want to go back on your word?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She agreed to marry him?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She actually agreed to marry him?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul must have thought she didn't remember anything and was deliberately making things up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I was drunk, don't believe what I said," she argued.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Words spoken by a drunken woman are just nonsense, they shouldn't be taken seriously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Paul didn't care about that, he continued to manipulate Eva step by step.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You told me last night that you wouldn't marry anyone but me in this lifetime, and that you wanted to have many children with me. You desperately catered to me, one after another, and I couldn't resist anymore. So, are you saying you've forgotten all of that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva didn't forget, she just didn't have any recollection.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She widened her eyes, looking at Paul with a puzzled expression, as if asking, "Did I really say those things?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul was very sincere, nodding his head. "They say drunk words are sober thoughts. It must mean you really like me a lot, that's why you couldn't help but call me your husband..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Husband?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva took a deep breath. Did those words really come out of her mouth?!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That couldn't be possible!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva pushed Paul away, somewhat incredulous, and turned to face him. "I would never call you that, don't make things up."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul raised his strong and muscular arm, leaning on the sink, and the one he was holding was Eva.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He lowered his head, looking at Eva who was a bit shorter than him. "You agreed to marry me, that's a fact. Don't try to go back on your word."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wanted to marry her, even if he had to deceive her, he wanted to win her over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva blinked her eyes twice, desperately trying to remember. It seemed like Paul did say he wanted to marry her, but did she agree?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When she didn't know how to respond, a knock on the door interrupted them. Mandy's trembling voice came from outside, "Eva, Amelia is here..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing this, Eva quickly bent down and slipped out from under Paul's arm. "I'll go see Amelia first, you stay here and don't come out."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Watching the woman slip away, Paul curled his lips, revealing a radiant smile. He had never felt such joy before, it made him incredibly happy.</span></p></div>
