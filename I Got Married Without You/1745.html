        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The people in black remained silent and looked towards positions 2-9.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Room 9 was in charge of Venom's people</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The first group of black clad people were about to say that Cobra from the second group was missing when they were interrupted by a female voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The female voice, clearly trying to protect 2-9, intentionally shifted the blame onto Venom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Venom didn't say a word, only gave the other person a cold glance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Venom, please have your people immediately go to the detention room and be investigated.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The mechanical sound disappeared, Venom put down his overlapping long legs, got up and walked down from a high position, pausing slightly for a moment as he crossed positions 2-7.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The commanding aura is quite intimidating, but the woman in position 2-7 is wearing her hands around her chest, looking forward without even raising her head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;You wait.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Venom dropped this, stepped down the steps, and walked forward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He happened to bump into Cobra returning at the corner.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the two passed by, they glanced at each other.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;You are one step late.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The program on the Erebus console was difficult to decipher, and although Cobra was a bit late, he was quite capable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At least he could turn off the surveillance screen of the player room, even if the time was short.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man named Cobra didn't pay any attention to Venom and walked back to the viewing area.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Venom turned around and stared at Cobra's tall figure, narrowing his eyes slightly under the mask</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stood for a while and arrived at the program room. After successfully verifying his palm print and iris, the door of the program room opened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He went in and asked the person in black who was responsible for the program in Room 9 to immediately go to the detention room and then return the same way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same turning point, Cobra was standing there waiting for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon seeing it, Venom walked slowly over without speaking first.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The other party doesn't intend to make him speak, just say a few words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Go down there.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cobra's voice was very low and his words were concise, but Venom knew what he was saying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked up at the surveillance and tapped the Morse code with his fingers on the side of his pants.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;The game has started, and none of us have permission to continue unless we crack the 1-1 program.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cobra seemed to understand the message he was conveying and wanted to ask anything else.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Venom instinctively glanced at him and then glanced up towards the surveillance direction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cobra understood, nodded at him, turned straight around, and quickly left</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Venom stared at his back and slowly curled up the corner of his lips. If this kid were in Group 1, it would be great.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In room 9, Amelia stared at Johnny, while the other person shook his head and signaled her not to speak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Realizing that they were under surveillance, she stopped speaking and instead began to wonder in her mind who had made her leave?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The only possibility that came to her mind was James and Zack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But they came in as players and would only be controlled by Erebus, unable to become Erebus's manipulators.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, it was not yet known whether they were dead or alive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, no matter who it was, this note was passed on too late. She had already confirmed it and couldn&rsquo;t leave again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Amelia pondered, the electronic sound rang again:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Players who stay, please start selecting the game area.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Electronic sound drops, and on the wall next to it, an electronic screen appears, displaying game introductions in four areas.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia and Johnny are still handcuffed together, so they must have chosen the same area, but which area should they choose?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Childhood, youth, middle age, old age, the names of these spaces are quite casual.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Could it be the difficulty level of the corresponding game?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;So let's choose by name, childhood space. It feels simpler, should we choose this?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia pointed to the lower right corner plate while soliciting Johnny's opinion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;In old age, actions are already very slow, and intelligence is also deteriorating. Perhaps the space for old age is simpler.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia thought for a moment and felt that Johnny was also right.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then choose old age.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After the two had finalized, simultaneously click on the confirmation button at the bottom of the screen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>About a few minutes later, the electronic sound rang again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Childhood space, difficulty two stars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Youth space, three stars in difficulty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Middle age space, difficulty four stars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Old age space, difficulty level five stars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia slowly lifted her cold eyes and looked at Johnny.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The other party quickly moved away after touching her line of sight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Next time you ask me to choose anything, I won&rsquo;t choose it.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Do you think there's another chance?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They picked the most difficult one as soon as they came up, and it's not certain if they can survive nine rounds of the game.</span></p></div>
