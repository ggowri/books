        <h1>Chapter 1833: Solutions</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In his solitude, James felt hollow and numb, leaning against the icy wall with a heart throbbing in pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>1-1 had seen the surveillance footage and recognized Amelia's resemblance to his wife, which led to the DNA test confirming she was his granddaughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But if he could recognize a family member just by looks, it meant there were people in his family who looked like Amelia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aside from Emily, who shared a father with Amelia, Dylan's eyes were familiar...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If his guess was right, 1-2, who had twice hinted at something, must be Dylan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was no reason for 1-2 to talk to him or risk offending 1-1 if he wasn't related to Amelia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And the fact that 1-2 dared to do it twice in front of 1-1 suggested that they were not only partners but also family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Otherwise, 1-1 would have blamed him at the first instance, but he didn't.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Plus, when 1-2 spoke to him, he always used a synthetic voice, indicating that they had met before and he was disguising his identity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Dylan being 1-2, it wasn't hard to guess who 1-1 was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, 1-1 was Matty, the North American big shot, capable of operating Erebus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once James figured this out, his dull eyes regained their sparkle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">If Amelia hears Matty's claim tomorrow he knows Erebus' founder, she'll get suspicious. His consistent Erebus visits suggest he hasn't met the founder, but if he says otherwise, Amelia will realize he has. She'll figure out his situation. Once he escapes, he can obliterate Erebus with S, get payback, and reunite with Amelia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James, comforted by this thought, leaned back, silently promising revenge to the bodies in the pods.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After tweaking the control room chip, Matty returned James' stuff and pointed him to room 2-9 before jetting off to Canada.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Amelia sat pondering, then texted Andrew her plan to head to Erebus tomorrow. She'd update him once there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Andrew, keen to bring his crew, called back. But Amelia disagreed, saying Matty would notice a crowd, making it hard to shake them off like they did with Johnny.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She'd go ahead, count heads, then secretly message Andrew for planning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Andrew conceded, told her to stay safe, and then informed Peter to mobilize his team in Canada.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Andrew considered looping in the Davies siblings, but Peter advised against it because Master Davies was acting oddly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both felt something was off since James vanished, Master Davies was missing, and there were no rescue attempts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After syncing up with Peter, Andrew quickly pulled out of the Cloud territory, leading a group of trusted allies on an overnight journey to Canada, where they set up a perimeter near the commercial district.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia wanted to go alone, not only to deliver the message to James and deal with Emily but also to dismantle Erebus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She planned to stay in Erebus after delivering the message and sorting out Emily, using her status to stir up trouble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, she realized her plan was naive; the puppeteers of Erebus might not pay her any mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, she decided to send Andrew the location once she had a clear understanding of Erebus. If she couldn't dismantle it, at least she'd have a backup team.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This way, James, who was being held captive, could be freed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her only concern was dragging Andrew and his team into this, but she had no other options.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead of Andrew's team blindly searching, it was better for her to coordinate with them from inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After making up her mind, Amelia took a bath before quickly falling asleep due to her pregnancy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When she woke up, it was already 8 a.m., and she rushed to get ready, eager to head to Erebus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon stepping out of her bedroom, she found Matty already seated at the dining table.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Waving her over for breakfast, Matty handed Amelia some nutritious food.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After eating, Amelia asked when they were leaving.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matty had some items packed and then got up, saying, "It's a long trip. Brought some snacks in case you get hungry."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia glanced at the items Matty was carrying - they were all her favorites, and there was even a good deal of plum-based items to prevent airsickness.</span></p></div>
