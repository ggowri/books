        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James recovered faster than Amelia, and most of the time he took care of her. When Amelia opened her eyes, she saw a tall and handsome man holding a hot towel, gently wiping her legs.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Today, there was no snow and the sun was shining.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The golden light streamed through the glass and fell on Amelia's cold and thin figure, like a warm current flowing into her heart.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His movements were skilled and gentle, afraid of waking her up or making her </span><span>uncomfortable.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sensing her burning gaze, James looked back with a tender and tired look.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The doctor said that if you're in a coma for too long, the blood circulation in your legs will be affected. Wiping them with a hot towel every day will help," he explained. He then turned his body and changed the towel, first applying it to her lower legs and then gently wiping them.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Actually, he rarely took care of others, but in the past six months, he had learned a lot about nursing to prevent Amelia's physical functions from deteriorating once she woke up.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia was deeply moved, tears welling up in her eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She propped herself up and reached out to embrace the man. "I don't know why, but in this moment, I love you so much, more than anyone else."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James, being held, slowly put down the towel in his hand and turned his body to embrace her. "Then between me and our son, who do you love more?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia, who was initially touched, found James' question childish.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She felt that she loved him more, so she didn't answer him directly and instead asked, "And what about you? Between me and our son, who do you love more?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without even blinking, James replied firmly, "Of course it's you. That little brat almost took your life. I still love him, but how could I not love you more?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes and tone were full of disdain, as if he had a grudge against his own baby. Amelia was unhappy. "He is our child. If you're going to despise him, I won't talk to you anymore."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia pushed him away, but James grabbed her back. He held her waist and pulled her into his arms. "I promise you, I won't despise him anymore. Don't ignore me."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia obediently nestled in his arms. "After waking up, I only saw him once and I miss him a little. How about I leave the hospital early and go home for treatment?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're not fully recovered yet. Wait until you're completely better before going home."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia wanted to say that besides having difficulty walking, she was already fine. But before she could speak, James' cold lips pressed against hers. "Let me kiss you first."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could imagine that after going home, Amelia's thoughts and attention would be focused on someone else.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So he wanted to seize this recovery time and let her get closer to him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With this in mind, James gently sucked on Amelia's cherry lips, then tenderly and somewhat recklessly pried open her teeth.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that moment of their lips and tongues touching, Amelia's body felt a bit tingly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every time he kissed her, it brought a thrilling sensation, not because of his exceptional skills, but because of the surge of adrenaline that made her feel so pleasurable. Her delicate body would always go weak.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When she couldn't hold on any longer from the kiss, James, with his strong arms, supported her waist with one hand and held the back of her head with the other, preventing her from slipping out of his embrace.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He used the power of his lips to give her an intense experience.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She felt the electric shock, and so did James. However, for him, it wasn't just about kissing, but making love.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since their first kiss, all he could think about was how to pin her down on the bed.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, Amelia's body couldn't handle it, and he was also afraid that she would get pregnant again after they made love.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if they took precautions, he was still afraid. So he decided to just kiss her.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When the two of them were lost in their kiss, Paul entered the room excitedly, pushing the door open. "Look who we brought here..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul's voice started off loud but gradually became softer.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva, who was following behind him, felt a bit strange and looked up.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What she saw was the deep and affectionate kiss between the man and woman under the warm sun.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva also raised her hand to cover the big eyes of the baby, who was staring at what his parents were doing.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Paul, who was leading the way, shamelessly burst into laughter. "You guys continue, we'll go outside and watch."</span></p></div>
