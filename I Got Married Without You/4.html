        <h1>Chapter 4 His Long Lost Love</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Oh em gee, REALLY?" Bella&rsquo;s jaw hung open in shock.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She pulled Olivia close and whispered excitedly, "Didn't you say that the CEO of the Evans Group wasn&rsquo;t interested in women? Sounds like he might have a secret love! AND she&rsquo;s the future CEO of our company!?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Olivia patted Bella's hand with a smile. "You really should try to be more informed about these things, Bella. How can you work in the CEO's office and not know all this hot gossip?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Well c&rsquo;mon, hurry up and tell me now, I&rsquo;m all ears!" Bella said, quickly tugging on Olivia's sleeve.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Olivia lowered her voice. "Mr. Evans and the chairman's daughter were childhood sweethearts. Rumor has it, Mr. Evans proposed to Ms. Moore five years ago. But she turned him down to focus on her studies, so they split up. They haven't even contacted each other for the last five years. But as soon as Ms. Moore returned to the country, Mr. Evans personally went to the airport to pick her up. That&rsquo;s enough to prove that Mr. Evans still has strong feelings for her."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Bella covered her mouth, widened her big round eyes, and almost exclaimed, "Oh my god! It&rsquo;s like the perfect sweet romance!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Amelia's heart ached in her chest, and gloom spread through her face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">So the truth was&hellip; James terminated their contract early because his long lost love, his real love, had come back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">But if he already had a childhood love, why did he buy her for one night five years ago?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">And after sleeping with her just once, he even forced her to sign a contract to continue their &ldquo;relationship&rdquo;.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">And whenever he touched her, he went so crazy that he couldn't control himself and keep his hands off her, spending hours and hours in bed together.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Amelia couldn't believe it. Just as she was about to ask Olivia where she had heard this gossip, the elevator opened with a ding!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The executive assistant of the chairman, Lily, and several department managers walked out first. Right after, a man in a luxurious suite with a cold aura followed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He had a face and body carved and chiseled by the gods, with the same aloof temperament.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He seemed almost unreal, like he&rsquo;d stepped out of an oil painting, a mix of elegance and coldness, always keeping a distance from others.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Amelia would recognize that face anywhere. &lsquo;James&hellip;&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Lily gestured to the people inside. "Mr. Evans, Ms. Moore, here is the president's office. This way please."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&lsquo;Why is he here?&rsquo; she thought, watching James turn and offer his hand to someone in the elevator. Then, a delicate, fair hand was placed in his, and a woman stepped out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The moment Amelia saw her face, she finally understood why James bought her for the night and made their contract, all those years ago.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Except for a few minor differences, Amelia had almost the exact same face as James&rsquo; former lover.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She used to think James would return her feelings one day and love her for who she was, but now she knew&hellip; she was just a temporary substitute.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Her chest suddenly tightened, and pain swept through her body, turning her face pale.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Bella immediately asked with concern, "Amelia? What's wrong? Are you feeling sick?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Amelia shook her head gently, and before Bella could say anything else, Lily led the two of them over.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She quickly lowered her eyes and didn&rsquo;t dare look them in the eyes. She couldn&rsquo;t stop her hands from trembling on the keyboard as Lily introduced them one by one.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"This is the president's office. The assistants here are available to help you with anything you need, Ms. Moore."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Ms. Moore nodded, looked at everyone, and said softly, "Good morning, everyone. My name&rsquo;s Emily Moore. Starting today, I'll be your new CEO."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&lsquo;Emily&hellip;&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Amelia couldn&rsquo;t seem to get enough air into her lungs, and she felt lightheaded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Memories started flooding back of her and James, their bodies writhing and entwined in bed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Every time, he&rsquo;d softly call out a name that she could never fully hear, and she always hoped it was hers&mdash;Amelia&hellip;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Only now did she realize that he was not calling out to her, but to Emily...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Amelia clenched her fists, and her long nails dug into her flesh, but she felt no pain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The suffocating feelings of humiliation and abandonment overwhelmed her, and she couldn't fight her tears.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She was so stupid to have fallen in love with James, a man who would never ever love her back.</p></div>
