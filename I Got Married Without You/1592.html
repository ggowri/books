        <h1>Chapter 1592 Maybe we should stop</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stella lowered her unfathomable gaze, staring at Henry's wrist wrapped in gauze. After a moment, she slowly hooked the corner of her lip and said, "Henry, ever since we've been together, it's been nothing but injuries. </span><span>Maybe we should stop</span><span>."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing this, Henry felt a fierce tremor in his heart. He didn't know why, but it seemed like he had a premonition that Stella would give this kind of answer. So when Stella said it, Henry wasn't surprised, but...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stella, Erin is gone. There won't be anyone else to hurt me..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stella looked away and met Henry's hopeful gaze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I have taken a life and been violated in front of you. These two barriers, I can never overcome them in my heart..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't offer any other reasons, just said it directly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Who could go through such humiliation and still peacefully marry someone for a lifetime? If it were anyone else, they probably wouldn't even want to see each other again. Stella was considered strong, at least she could help treat Henry as if nothing happened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't mind."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Henry looked at Stella, his eyes were filled with a pained expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stella, you're just forced to do this. It's not your fault, including shooting and killing Erin. You were forced to do it, you didn't really want to kill him. I see all of this, and I understand you. So I don't mind at all, why do you..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stella smiled, her eyes curved like the brightest moon in the night sky.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Henry, I do mind."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After interrupting Henry with a smile, Stella turned to look at the middle-aged couple standing outside the hospital room. When she saw their tired faces and graying hair, she sighed deeply.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Henry, your parents are getting older, they can't handle any more turmoil. They love you so much, and they're so open-minded. You should think about them more..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Henry, in addition to the reasons mentioned above, I also have to tell you that I still haven't completely fallen in love with you..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This sentence made Henry swallow the words he was about to say. He lowered his head, staring at his own wrist for a while, and then, unwillingly, he raised his head again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stella, I know you haven't fallen in love with me yet. It's always been just me, wishful thinking. But what can I do? As long as I love you, it's enough."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's not enough."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After rejecting Henry, Stella raised her eyebrows and gave him a faint smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Being with you before, you made me feel loved. I thought that would be enough for a lifetime, but I never thought that what I'm doing is unfair to you..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He loved her purely and passionately, and she should reciprocate with the same love, but she couldn't. Regardless of whether Henry minds or not, it's unfair to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Henry, you're such a kind and outstanding person. You deserve a better woman. And as a murderer like me, I am destined to be lonely until the end."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if the law doesn't punish her, she will face consequences in other ways. Her life will never be peaceful again. So why drag Henry down to hell with her?</span></p></div>
