        <h1>Chapter 1992 James' Birthday Gift</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James was neither a good person nor a very bad person, but he had used all means to gain power and position. Not saying that he had killed many people, but his hands were stained with blood. For such a person, decades of age was the end of his life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the end, he didn't blame anyone, except... James turned around and looked towards the villa. He saw a figure standing by the window. His eyes were indifferent, but there was reluctance in them. "If I broke my promise, you will take care of your mom for me in all her life."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander knew that the love between his parents was so deep that it was hard for anyone to replace it, so how could he agree to this. "Father, you made a promise, and you should fulfill it yourself, don't ask me to do it for you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James knew that his son was tough on the outside but soft on the inside. If he was really gone, his son would still take care of Amelia. In fact, all the necessary arrangements had been made, but he was still afraid that Amelia would risk everything. "Your mom may seem gentle, but in fact she is stubborn. If she does anything stupid in the future, you have to find a way to stop her..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander didn't want to hear such words, as if telling the last words, which made him feel very uncomfortable. "Father, I have calculated to the last step. In two months, I will be able to do it perfectly. By then, you and Mom can still hold hands and spend your twilight years together."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James smiled again, like the wind in the snow, the birds in the forest, the clouds in the sky, the haze in the fog, and the fish in the water, so vivid and yet so elusive. Just like a person who was about to leave, standing in the sun, but following the laws of life and death, step by step, heading towards his destination.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander couldn't catch his father, as if he didn't have time to say goodbye. He took out an exquisite gift box from his suit pocket and handed it to him. "I should have waited until your birthday to give it to you, but for some reason, I just want to give it to you today."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James' long, thick eyelashes slowly drooped down, and he reached out his fingers to take it. "Since you were ten years old, you have given me gifts every year on my birthday. What I didn't get as a child, I got from you and your mom, so I don't regret it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, he opened the box, revealing an expensive watch. Looking at the watch, James smiled again, "You and your mom have a deep connection. The gifts you gave me are the same, but... she told you that I like watches, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander took the watch, lifted up James' sleeve, and put it on his wrist. "Father, this time, I didn't ask Mom. If we chose the same gift, it only means that Mom and I both hope that we can spend every minute and every second with you in the future."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Such heartwarming words, like the scorching sun, gradually penetrated into James' heart, making him feel extremely warm. "Today is your birthday, but you gave me such an expensive gift. It seems that I have to put in some effort."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Speaking of this, Alexander felt helpless and aggrieved. "Father, how about you not give me any gifts this year? I don't really need anything from you..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James raised his eyebrows and asked, "Why, the gifts I gave you were so unpresentable?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander stared at him. "You only choose gifts and even make them yourself for Mom. The gifts you gave to others were perfunctory."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every year, he asked Peter to buy the gifts. Peter was a single man with bad taste in choosing gifts. The things he bought could be found everywhere on the street, which were so perfunctory.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James faced the endless white snow and smiled faintly, "You should know that in my heart, no one is better than your mom."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander said, "Of course I know. So be perfunctory as you want. Anyway, in Mom's heart, I am as important as you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James turned his eyes slightly and glanced at him indifferently. "As I said, your mom is mine, not yours. So don't even think about snatching my place in her heart."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander had only heard Andrew say that his father was super jealous when he was young, but Alexander didn't take it seriously. Now, after being jealous for eighteen years, he became speechless. "Okay, okay, you are number one in her heart, and I am number two, okay?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James smiled and asked, "It will be your coming-of-age ceremony at twelve o'clock. Before that, what birthday gift do you want?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, Alexander understood that his father was going to prepare a birthday present for him personally this time, and he couldn't help but smile. "Peter and Andrew told me that you are very good at cooking. Can you make dinner for me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James was pretty sure that Alexander was tricked by them, but he remained calm and asked him, "Are you sure?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander nodded frantically. "Of course."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Besides, Peter and Andrew both said that his father only cooked for his mother. As a son, he should at least enjoy once, right?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James patted his shoulder and said, "Okay, I'll cook for you tonight."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing that James was going to cook for Alexander, Amelia looked at her son who was leaning happily at the door with sympathy, then silently took out an apron and tied it on for James.</span></p></div>
