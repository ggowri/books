        <h1>Chapter 1902 The Fate of Master Davies</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia waved nonchalantly at Dylan, "It's not your fault. You're just following orders. Besides, you helped me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dylan slowly lowered his gaze, hiding the guilt in his eyes, and then looked at the prominent belly, "Has the baby been named yet?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Following his gaze, Amelia took a glance and then shook her head, "Not yet, do you have any suggestions?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dylan's gaze swept towards the man standing not far away, waiting for Amelia. "With him around, I wouldn't dare to casually suggest a name for your child."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia lifted her head, looking at the handsome and distinguished James. "Actually, he may seem cold on the outside, but he's really gentle on the inside. You'll understand once you've spent more time with him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James had always been good to the people he wanted to protect and valued. Otherwise, people like Zack, Andrew, and Peter wouldn't have spent their whole lives following him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Me, getting along with James?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dylan pressed his lips together in a light chuckle, "In the future, I might just come to visit you and your kid. As for getting along with him, I'm afraid that's unlikely. After all, we did have a fight back in Erebus."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because of the issues with Dylan's grandfather, it was hard for them to get along. Of course, if he avenged his grandfather and if James was willing, he could have let go of their past disputes for the sake of Amelia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia heard that the two had fought, and she couldn't help but frown, "You guys had a fight? Could you beat him?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dylan, who was being questioned, rolled up his sleeves to reveal his muscular arms. He lifted his chin towards Amelia, "I'm pretty strong, you think I can't beat him?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia was amused by him, "So you're this capable."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dylan: "That's because you think your husband can do anything."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two siblings were having a pretty good chat, but unfortunately, the good times didn't last. Matty, who had been waiting on the side for a long time, came over and said, "It's time to board the plane."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then Matty looked Amelia up and down, "It's been a month since we last met, you look much healthier than before, and you've put on a bit of weight. Seems like you've been doing pretty well recently."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Facing Matty, not only did Amelia lose her good complexion, but she also showed a hint of impatience: "I'm back in my own home, not imprisoned by anyone, of course, I'm doing well."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia's words were dripping with sarcasm, making Matty feel a bit awkward. "I'm sorry about what happened before," she said, "but at that time, I really thought James was at odds with Erebus, so I didn't want you to be with him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia didn't want to hear his excuses. She said coldly, "From now on, just keep your distance from me. If you dare to threaten my husband again, don't blame me for not being polite."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Matty saw the only indifference in the face of his granddaughter, he couldn't help but feel sad: "Don't worry, I won't threaten James anymore, nor will I disturb your married life."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia gave him a cold glance, no longer responding. Without any reason to stay, Matty turned around, giving the two kids some time to say goodbye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dylan felt the pang of this parting, unsure of when he would see his sister again. Unable to hold back, he opened his arms and said with a hint of reluctance, "Let's hug. Looking forward to seeing you again."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia looked into Dylan's eyes, seeing his reluctance to let go. She felt the warmth of </span><span>familial love. Likewise, she reached out her arms and gently embraced Dylan. The siblings only held each other for a moment before letting go.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dylan took a step back, waving at Amelia. Amelia waved back at him, "Dylan if you come up with a good baby name, remember to send it to me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dylan nodded with a smile, then disappeared into the crowd. He followed a group of people in suits and ties into the airport until he was out of sight. Only then did Amelia turn to face James.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sweetheart."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Huh?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's go home."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James took long strides over to Amelia, gently placed his hand on her waist, and helped her into the car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps it was because she had been standing for too long, Amelia's back was aching a bit. James, being considerate, started to gently massage her lower back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man's movements were gentle and patient, massaging all the way until they returned to Blue Bay Island.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia was already seven months pregnant, and her belly felt a bit heavy. Whether she was standing or sitting, she was uncomfortable. Sometimes, her legs even went numb and cramped up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luckily, she had James by her side. During the day, when her legs would go numb, he would kneel on one knee and massage them for her. If she got a leg cramp in the middle of the night, he would wake up immediately to help her ease the pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Whenever Amelia sighed, turned over, or said she was uncomfortable, James would always be concerned. He would feel heartbroken, wishing he could take Amelia's place and endure the hardships of pregnancy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While he was busy taking care of Amelia, news came from Holden that Matty had found Master Davies. The two had clashed several times, neither gaining the upper hand. It was only when Matty risked his life that he finally forced Master Davies to surrender.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Master Davies cunningly argued that the matter concerning Sophia was the doing of the older generation, and had nothing to do with him. He insisted that under no circumstances should he be held responsible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matty realized that the incident had little to do with Master Davies, so he had no intention of threatening his life. However, in his attempt to escape, Master Davies launched a sneak attack from behind, injuring Dylan and nearly causing a fatality. It was only then that Matty decided to fight back fiercely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Master Davies' death at the hands of Matty was something that could be seen coming, but it still hit Holden hard. He thought Master Davies would reveal to Matty that he was Bernard's grandson to save himself, but Master Davies didn't do that.</span></p></div>
