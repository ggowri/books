        <h1>Chapter 1614 Back to Panama</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Apart from Amelia and her companionship, Andrew and Mia also often visit Stella. Even when Mia is pregnant, she still frequently goes to Stella's house to cook for her and chat with her, but they avoid talking about children. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone Knew that Stella didn&rsquo;t have a uterus, so even though pregnancy was a joyous occasion, Mia avoided the topic. However, Stella didn&rsquo;t mind and often touched Mia's belly, talking to the baby. The most common thing she said was that she would give the baby a big gift once it's born. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In her will, Stella wrote that all of her assets will go to Andrew's child. She found a lawyer to include the assets in her will and made clear arrangements for her affairs. Then she took out her phone and called Amelia. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia, who was holding Grace's hand and about to go out, answered Stella's call with surprise, "Stella, what's going on?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stella looked at her watch and said, "Amelia, I suddenly took on an overseas medical mission and will be doing charity work abroad for a month. I'm afraid I won't be able to accompany you guys today." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia stopped walking and frowned, "You're going for a whole month?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stella nodded, "Yes, you know charity work takes a long time. A month is already short." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia asked, "Why did you suddenly take on this kind of job?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the dean, Stella could just focus on management, but she always goes to the frontline and takes on all kinds of work. Now she even has to personally go on medical missions. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stella replied, "Doing something meaningful is better than wasting time." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia didn't know how to respond. She couldn't stop Stella from doing good deeds, so she asked, "Will someone accompany you?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stella nodded, "Yes, doctors from various departments have been assigned. It's organized." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia felt slightly relieved and said, "Remember to send me videos every day, call me every day, and let me know if anything happens." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stella smiled faintly, "Don't worry, I will." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Amelia gave many more instructions and Stella promised one by one, they hung up the phone. Stella picked up her luggage, which had been prepared long ago, and drove to the airport. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The medical mission was indeed real, and Stella's name was on the list, but she didn't actually go. It was just a little trick to deceive Amelia. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Amelia finished reading the list, she felt relieved and sent a message to Stella, reminding her to stay safe on the road. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stella, who was on her way to Panama, saw the message and replied with a smile, "Okay, don't worry," before turning off her phone and sitting in her seat, looking out the window. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She soon arrived in Panama and rented a boat to reach the island. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This small island had been in a state of lockdown since its owner was suspected of committing suicide, and the security line had not been lifted. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stella lifted the security line, bent over, and entered. Inside, nobody had taken care of it, and it was overgrown with weeds. Everywhere showed signs of desolation, completely different from when Erin was here. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stella stood in the mansion, looking around at the scene before her, feeling an indescribable emotion. She moved forward with stiff steps, dragging her heavy suitcase, step by step, into the villa... </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon entering, she saw black footprints everywhere. These were left by people coming in and out, making the originally clean and smooth living room look dirty. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stella put down her suitcase, took out the steak from inside and put it in the refrigerator. Then she went to the bathroom to get cleaning tools and cleaned the living room thoroughly. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She cleaned from the first floor to the third floor. When she stood at the door of the birdcage room, her footsteps seemed to be nailed in place. She didn't dare to take another step forward, as if she would witness a scene of collapse once she pushed open the door.</span></p></div>
