        <h1>Chapter 1868 Carson retreated</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Carson's hesitation and dilemma, Holden spoke lightly. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Clark, we only want to avenge our friends. Once we deal with the 49 manipulators, we will retreat."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, if you let us go, we will not harm your people, and you can save the lives of your friends." Honestly, Holden's words were both reasonable and tempting, causing the black-clad men under Carson to start wavering.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Venom, he's right. The organization only sent us out to fight, clearly wanting us to die."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, if they want us to die, why don't they send more people to help us? Why should we continue to risk our lives?" Carson lowered his gaze, staring at the gun in his hand, his furrowed brows representing his hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Uncle." Although Johnny couldn't accept the fact that James was his cousin, he still stood up in the face of right and wrong.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I know you have strong feelings for Erebus, but the current situation is not in your favor."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As for the grudge between the Clark family and the S organization, let's settle it after this is over. Don't let your friends die for it." Carson raised his hesitant gaze, looked at Johnny, and then turned to James, who had remained silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What do you think?" James' deep and domineering voice echoed through the burning mountains.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you want to fight, I'll accompany you to the end, but..." James' eyes, filled with a chilling aura, swept over Carson and landed on the black-clad men holding guns but unsure of what to do.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I won't spare any of your men!" His voice was already cold and ruthless, but this statement made it even more oppressive, leaving the black-clad men on the other side breathless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Venom..." Carson's subordinate, filled with fear, called out to Carson again, his </span><span>trembling voice carrying a hint of compromise and warning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carson admired his nephew's character and way of doing things. He slowly put down the gun in his hand and raised his hand, waving it in the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Retreat!" Matty, watching Carson and his subordinates leave in front of the monitors, felt a sudden chill in his eyes that had been tempered by time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Who could have imagined that James was actually Carson's nephew, and even more unexpected was Carson's betrayal due to this family relationship. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matty, who considered himself a master strategist, couldn't help but feel angry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Boss, James and his men are coming towards Zone A!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"His access to Erebus has been closed, there's no need to panic." Matty's words had just fallen when he saw James' men bringing explosives.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the blink of an eye, the sound of earth-shattering explosions came. As the surveillance footage of </span><span>Zone</span><span> A closed, all the manipulators in Erebus panicked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Boss, they should have rushed in, let's retreat quickly!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Compared to the manipulators' panic, Matty, as the founder of Erebus, was obviously much calmer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Eason, you take Dylan and leave through the escape passage."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>1-5, who received the order, knew that Matty was protecting him, but it wasn't fair to the others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Boss, why don't we all retreat together?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matty, leaning against the sofa, flicked the cigarette ash in his hand and looked at the others with sharp eyes through the smoke.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Those who want to retreat, follow Eason."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The manipulators in the control room looked at each other and then turned to Matty, who was sitting in the main seat, smoking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And what about you?" Matty picked up the cigarette, placed it on his lips, took another puff, and replied calmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll stay."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The manipulators were puzzled, but Matty, calm and composed, explained the reason.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's actually a good thing for them to break in. At least I can take revenge."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You all retreat quickly. Erebus has a kill program, and once they enter the interior, I will activate it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if he was alone, Matty believed that he could single-handedly kill half of the S members.</span></p></div>
