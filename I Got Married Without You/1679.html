        <h1>Chapter 1679 Brother-in-law</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James glanced at him indifferently as he walked towards the company, coldly saying, "I'm not interested in your good news."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul, accustomed to this, caught up with his pace and said nonchalantly, "James, guess what I did yesterday?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man exuding a cold aura climbed the stairs and replied, "I don't know, but I do know that you didn't even care about the company in order to win back Ms. Miller."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul, feeling somewhat guilty for not having come to the company during this time, reassured him, "James, I promise to come to the company on time from now on, never absent."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After making his promise, Paul leaned closer to James and whispered in his ear, "Do you know why?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feeling annoyed by his chatter, James replied coldly, "Did you win Ms. Miller back?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul's face lit up with joy, "Not only did I win her back, she won't ever leave again."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Having already guessed the good news, James played along and asked, "So, you didn't bring her home and she won't leave? How is that possible?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When the topic was thrown back at him, Paul's smile became even more cheerful, "I married her. We just got our marriage certificate yesterday. Surprised?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To his disappointment, James didn't react at all. He didn't even look at him. Paul was puzzled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"James, don't you feel surprised at all?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Surprised."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I knew it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, James turned his head and looked at Paul.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's that look on your face, James? Are you looking down on me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James didn't say anything. He just withdrew his gaze and walked towards the elevator. Paul, feeling scorned, quickly caught up with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I married Eva. Shouldn't you call me brother-in-law?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This remark finally got a reaction from James. He paused his steps.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He turned his tall and straight body, lowered his gaze, and stared at Paul.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What did you just call me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Brother-in-law. Did I say it wrong?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the face of Paul's provocation, James gave him a deep look.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you want to die, or do you want to be removed from the Evans Family?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Can I choose neither?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James tilted his head slightly, his eyes like stars, locked onto Paul in a strange and intimidating way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I take back what I just said. Pretend you didn't hear anything."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul, who could be flexible and adaptable, acted dumb and pressed the elevator button, then made a welcoming gesture with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"James, didn't you say we were going to have a meeting? Come in."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only then did James avert his gaze from staring at him, step into the elevator.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was one more piece of news that Paul hadn't told James, and it was weighing on his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He secretly glanced at the man standing in the elevator, resembling a sculpture made of ice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Between being frozen to death and being suffocated by secrets, Paul chose the former without hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, by the way, James, let me tell you another piece of good news. Eva is pregnant. I'm going to be a father!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If the news of their marriage was something James had already anticipated, then the news of the pregnancy was a shock to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James' exquisite and ethereal face gradually turned grim.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Andrew, who got married after him, would become a father before him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul, who got married after Andrew, would also become a father before him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Would it be Zack's turn next?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When James had a gloomy expression on his face, Paul, who was overly happy, nudged his arm with his elbow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"James, if it weren't for you convincing my mom to apologize to Eva, I would still be tearing down the house right now. I wouldn't have known about the child."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James glanced at him and ignored him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul didn't notice and continued talking to himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Here's the thing, to show my gratitude to you, I'll let you choose the name for my child."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James rolled his eyes and said indifferently, "The child hasn't been born yet, we don't even know the gender. How can we choose a name?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul didn't mind at all, "Then let's choose one for a boy and one for a girl. That should be enough, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James, visibly annoyed, glanced at him, "Do you really want me to choose?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without thinking, James blurted out, "For a boy, Ken. For a girl, Barbie."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul: ... That's too random of a name!</span></p></div>
