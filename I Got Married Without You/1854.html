        <h1>Chapter 1854: Failed to Protect Him</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing James in this state, Andrew and Peter shared a glance before they both pushed open their car doors and rushed towards him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Evans!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Evans!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Touched by the sight of these two tearful men running towards him, James instinctively took a step back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon seeing this, Andrew and Peter halted in their tracks but their eyes remained filled with worry as they looked at James who stood in the light, glowing with an irresistible charm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Evans, you're finally back. We've been so worried," they choked out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a few seconds, James raised his hand and patted both Andrew and Peter on the shoulder, "Sorry to have worried you guys."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His casual tone and touch somehow brought a sense of security to Andrew and Peter. It seemed as long as Mr. Evans was back, all troubles could be resolved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They walked James to the car parked in the public area and drove off swiftly. Inside the car, the two men started discussing their worries over James' disappearance over the past six months.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I was more worried about Mr. Evans!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No way, I was the one who worried most about him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing their bickering, James, sitting in the backseat, couldn't help but crack a small smile, feeling alive again. However, his smile faded quickly as he remembered Amelia's words about not turning back after their breakup.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He clenched his fist tightly, feeling a sharp pain in his heart. He was alive, but at what cost? He had lost her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Through the rear-view mirror, Andrew noticed James' changed expression. He hesitated for a moment before asking, "Mr. Evans, you met Mrs. Evans in Erebus, didn't you? Why didn't she come back with you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As James remained silent, it wasn't hard to guess that there must have been some discord between them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Peter, who had grown up with Zack, was struggling to accept Zack's death. The fact that he died from a snakebite, rather than on a battlefield as he had once professed, was simply unbearable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Zack... Did he really...?" Peter asked, turning to face James.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Zack died to save me," James replied, his voice filled with remorse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a long silence, James finally spoke, "I... I failed to protect him..." His voice was filled with guilt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Andrew tried to offer some comfort, "Mr. Evans, it's not that you didn't protect Zack. He chose to protect you. He would do anything for you, even follow you secretly. To him, nothing was more important than you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James didn't respond. His eyes, touched by the fading twilight, were glazed with frost. It was clear that they had gone through something horrific in Erebus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, James managed to tell Andrew and Peter about what happened in Erebus, how Zack died and why they were trapped there. He also instructed Peter to gather the S members as soon as they got back, vowing to take revenge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even without James' order, Peter would have sought vengeance for Zack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With James' permission, he immediately set out to gather their team, while Andrew, as James' assistant, naturally followed </span><span>James</span><span> back to Blue Bay Island.</span></p></div>
