        <h1>Chapter 1670 Abortive operation</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The entire operating room soon only had Paul, exuding a cold aura, and Eva lying on the operating table.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why?" The man standing next to them didn't say anything extra, he just asked this one question.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva glanced at Mandy standing outside the operating room, frowned deeply, and then looked at Paul, who had a furious expression on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There's no why..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She knew that Paul had come and the surgery couldn't proceed. She immediately got up from the operating table, but Paul grabbed her wrist tightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His grip was strong, so strong that his fingers deeply indented into her skin. Eva winced in pain, her face turning pale, but she bit her lip and didn't make a sound...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her silence and refusal to look at him made Paul suddenly angry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Eva, is this your answer to me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had agreed that she would give him an answer after returning home, but her answer turned out to be secretly aborting their child.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Paul received Mandy's phone call, his heart, which had been filled with anticipation to marry Eva, suddenly turned cold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had chased after her so desperately, but his efforts were shattered by Eva's repeated rejections.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Eva, tell me why. After I have the answer, I will never come to find you again."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva lowered her gaze and slowly raised her eyelashes, looking at Paul, who was filled with despair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There needed to be closure between them, and they needed to have a clear conversation...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't believe that you and Elsie didn't have a relationship."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul, who was staring at her intently, darkened his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She explained it very clearly, it was her own manipulation. Why don't you believe her?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Because she gave me a recording pen afterward. Her so-called explanation was just a forced confession from your mother."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Eva, I don't know about my mother's forced confession, and I don't know about Elsie's recording. I only know that I haven't slept with her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He raised his hands and grabbed Eva's shoulders, staring into her eyes with utmost seriousness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm saying that I haven't done it. Do you believe me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva shook her head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, I don't believe you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul understood, he lost because she didn't believe him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've been entangled with you for five years. In these five years, I've only cared about you. Can't you see that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, his eyes turned dark red at the corners.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why do you believe others instead of me?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva lifted her chin, looking directly into Paul's eyes, filled with grievances.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I want to believe you too, but Paul, what sense of security have you given me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"After we broke up, you either verbally attacked me or brought other women to humiliate me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In my eyes, I only saw women surrounding you, nothing else."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You know that I never had a home since I was young and I've been betrayed by my husband. I'm afraid of these things."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But what about you? You're either with Kayla, Elsie, or other women. What can I use to trust you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva's emotional outburst made Paul slightly stunned in place, but then he forcefully pulled her into his embrace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I didn't know that I had fallen in love with you before, that's why I was childish and used this method to provoke you. I'm sorry, I haven't given you enough sense of security."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, Eva, nestled in his embrace, didn't resist, but rather weakly leaned against his chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was like saying goodbye, speaking softly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Paul, I don't believe you, not just before, but also now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul, holding her, also felt powerless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even if I promise to never have any contact with other women in the future, would you still choose to believe me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva curled her lips and smiled helplessly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How do you know I haven't?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"When I found out that I was pregnant, I thought it didn't matter whether you had been with Elsie or not, as long as you would be devoted to me in the future. But..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva's tears uncontrollably rolled down her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I saw you at the airport giving flowers to another woman. That's when I realized that it wasn't because of Elsie between us, but because of you. You can't change..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul's body stiffened, as if he had realized something. He let go of Eva, then grabbed her shoulders again, lowering his head to look at her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Eva, that woman's name is Camilla. She has been pursuing me, but I've been rejecting her. Yesterday, we happened to meet at the airport. She insisted on buying flowers and gave them to me. I told her that I was getting married, and after she wished me happiness, she quickly kissed me and ran away."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, he was too busy rushing to the restroom to wash his face and didn't notice that Eva had left the airport at that time. If he had known, he would've chased after her to explain.</span></p></div>
