        <h1>Chapter 1973 Make up a Question</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Asking him to apologize to such an idiot was an insult to Alexander's intelligence. But in order to beat James, Alexander swallowed his pride and said, "I'm sorry."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ken was instantly dumbfounded, quietly opening his eyes and peering through the gaps in his fingers at the retreating figure, murmuring, "Alexander, are you possessed by a ghost?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander rolled his eyes and continued to James, "Alright, I've apologized. What about the problem?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James elegantly sipped from his glass, set it down, and stood up. "Come to the study with me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander followed, but James didn't care about him at all. James just sat down at his desk, tilted his chin up, and left Alexander to fetch his chair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Biting back his irritation, Alexander rolled up his pristine sleeves and mustered all his strength. Clutching the back of the chair, he dragged it towards the desk, grunting with effort. It took him a while, but he finally pulled the chair over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once Alexander was seated, James finally powered on his computer, pulled up several questions, and rotated the screen towards him. "Six questions in total. One each from math, computer science, astronomy, anti-gravity, philosophy, and AI."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, Alexander felt like he was being overrated. "I still don't understand what anti-gravity is..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James didn't care whether Alexander understood or not. "Don't you think you're so clever? How come you don't even know what anti-gravity is?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Pushed into a corner, Alexander clenched his teeth in silence while James taunted him with a tilt of his chin. "You have one hour. If you can't figure it out, just admit defeat gracefully."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's face scrunched up tightly, but driven by pride, he decided to go all out against James.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He grabbed the computer and then lifted his head to gaze at the question on the screen, deep in thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James had programmed the test so that Alexander could only move on to the next question after solving the previous one. Stuck on the first question, Alexander was getting inexplicably annoyed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James, who was engrossed in a book, noticed Alexander's frustration and smirked. "If you can't figure it out, just admit defeat."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Alexander was not the type to give up easily. Frowning, he searched for formulas while thinking of a solution, proving why he was considered a prodigy. Even with knowledge acquired on the fly, he could quickly apply it effectively.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, the question was one of the world's most challenging problems, and no matter how many times Alexander tried, he couldn't crack it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feeling defeated for the first time, Alexander peeked out from beside the computer and looked across at his carefree father. "Didn't you say you wanted to compete with me? Why am I the only one solving problems while you do nothing?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this, James put down his book and said, "If you can't solve it, hand it over to me. But let's make it clear. If I solve it, you need to listen to me forever."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander, clenching his little fists, didn't believe James could solve it. In his eyes, James hardly had any skills, not even as much as Paul.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking this, Alexander unclenched his fists and, with a haughty expression, raised an eyebrow at James. "Fine, if you solve it, I'll listen to you forever."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James turned back to the computer and lifted his long fingers, beckoning. "Come here and see how I solve them."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smirked but obediently slid off his tall chair and walked over to stand beside James.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James, who rarely showed affection, didn't let Alexander stand alone. He grabbed his arms, lifted him, and placed him on his lap.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Incredulously, Alexander slowly turned his head to look at the man who had stretched out his arms to encircle his body and placed his long fingers on the keyboard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feeling the lingering warmth from James' embrace, Alexander felt an odd. The inexplicable warmth rose within him, bringing a pleasant sensation that made him smile involuntarily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, his smile was short-lived, interrupted by an incredible voice from above. "Why are you looking at me? Look at the questions."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was speechless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He turned his head back to the computer screen. In the blink of an eye, the man who had held him had quickly solved the first question at an astonishing speed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Watching the program jump to the next question in just half a minute, Alexander was stunned. How could James...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before he could ponder further, he saw James crack another computer challenge, followed by four more problems from different fields.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These questions were tough, but James completed them all in just eight minutes, which made Alexander suspicious. "Father, did you already know the answers?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander always called James "Father", unlike Maxwell, who would call Paul "Daddy". Used to this, James didn't mind the form of address. "If you're not convinced, you make up a question."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, Alexander typed a perplexing problem he had once seen related to weapons and said, "If you can solve this too, I'll admit defeat."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No sooner had he spoken than James casually raised his hand and effortlessly typed the answer, which quickly resolved Alexander's confusion on the screen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But even after the explanation, he incredulously twisted out of James' embrace, tilted his chin upward, and looked up at James' impressive features.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had not expected James to be not just a simple, affectionate man but also a brilliant one. These few puzzles proved James' expertise and extensive knowledge across various fields.</span></p></div>
