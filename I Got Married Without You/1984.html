        <h1>Chapter 1984 He Is Omnipotent</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That evening, it rained. Alexander, holding an umbrella, came out of school and walked into the alley as he met a group of foreigners holding iron bars. These people were all strong and ferocious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander, due to his high intelligence, occasionally encountered some foolish people to bother him. At first, he remembered what James had said and forced himself to endure, but he still got falsely accused by others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once, someone used the medicine he developed and put it into the professor's cup. If it hadn't been for other classmates to discover it, it would have caused a fatal incident. Because of this, Alexander, who couldn't bear it anymore, decided to counterattack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He beat up dozens of people in a day and was reported by the whole school. If it weren't for the professor's trust and protection, Alexander would have been expelled from school. Those bullies didn't bring down him, which led to the professor valuing him, so they became more jealous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew without guessing that the group of people in front of him was a group of bullies who had joined forces to teach him a lesson. While balancing his studies, Alexander also continued to learn combat skills with Peter so that he would not be afraid of them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander raised his umbrella slightly. He lifted the edge of the umbrella, appearing with a pair of fierce eyes and concealing his bloodthirsty killing intent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the killing intent spread, the group of strong men surrounded one after another. Alexander suddenly put away the umbrella in his hand, turned it into a weapon, and, with its sharp end, fiercely stabbed at the surrounding crowd!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With decisive actions and ruthless methods, he managed to knock down a group of people in just a few strokes. Although Alexander was powerful, he could not compete with more and more strong men...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He promised the professor not to harm anyone, but he was about to be knocked down and didn't care too much. Alexander pulled out the golden knife from his waist, aimed it at the strong man's abdomen, and stabbed it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing that Alexander dared to use a knife at a young age, several strong men were surprised for a moment, and then they made efforts to lift the iron rod in their hands and smash it at Alexander's head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The young masters in school had instructed them not to kill Alexander as long as they beat him up. The way to make someone foolish was to smash his head. Even if they did not smash Alexander into foolishness, they would smash him into a vegetative person!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In order to subdue Alexander, the group of strong men divided into two groups. One group exerted to knock Alexander down, while the other group clenched their iron bars and prepared to smash his head...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was exhausted and unable to withstand the opponent's strength, so he was pinned down in the rain. The unpleasant mud smell, as the rain increased, was splashed up bit by bit, splashing into his eyes and mouth...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His other cheek was stepped on by a strong man with his foot. So, Alexander struggled to avoid it but couldn't move. Just as he thought he was going to die tonight, a car light shone over him...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the sight mixed with rain and mud, he saw the Lincoln had come to a stop, and someone slowly opened the car door. Then, a strong figure walked down from inside...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The other party turned on the high beam, so no one could see who the person walking along the light was, only knowing that it was a tall man...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man walked in the light, lowering his head and slowly wearing gloves. Putting on his gloves, he spread out his fingers and suddenly clenched into a fist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The group of strong men had not even had a chance to react as they were punched hard in the face. The man was full of strength, and as he punched, one of the strong men's teeth fell off to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Getting closer, Alexander finally saw who the man was. He was drenched in the rain and couldn't open his eyes, but he exclaimed in surprise, "Father..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James knocked down the group of strong men in a few seconds, then walked over to him, crouched down, and snatched away the golden knife Alexander held in his hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He only glanced at Alexander, then held the knife, stepped on the mud, and walked step by step to the burly man lying on the ground and covering his face and causing pain to roll.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James was like a demon, facing the pouring rain, slowly squatting down, then holding onto the strong man's wrist without even blinking his eyes, cutting open his skin and veins with one blow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a scream that echoed through the sky, Alexander heard James speak like an emotionless machine. "I give you a knife. It's for this purpose, not for decoration."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was shocked and watched James pick out all the strong man's tendons before standing up straight. He took out his handkerchief and gently wiped the bloodstained blade while walking toward Alexander...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Have you learned it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James wiped the knife clean and returned it to Alexander. His indifferent face showed no signs of exhaustion from the fight. That was a calm rationality that Alexander had struggled to achieve throughout his life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He took the golden knife handed by James through the drizzling rain curtain, then looked up at the majestic figure in front of him...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Alexander admired James' abilities in the past, so, from this moment on, what Alexander felt was his omnipotence...</span></p></div>
