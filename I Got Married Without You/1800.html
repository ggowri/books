        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matty didn't say anything, just stared at him coldly, as if he had given an order and Carson just had to follow it, without saying a lot of nonsense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carson didn't argue with the old man, took out his phone, and called the old butler in front of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The old butler, who was really old, had his grandson answer the phone for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carson asked the old butler about </span><span>Sumasa</span><span>, and the old butler rambled on and on, making Matty impatient.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Afraid that Matty would lose his temper, Carson finally shouted, "Hey, can you hear me? If you can hear me, tell me why my grandfather adopted </span><span>Sumasa</span><span>!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The old butler's voice trembled and was somewhat unclear, "Ah... I can't hear you clearly..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carson looked at Matty, "Should we just forget it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matty took the phone and said coldly, "If you don't tell me, I'll have your whole family killed!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a moment of silence on the other end, the voice gradually steadied, "Who are you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matty said, "I'm </span><span>Sumasa's</span><span> father!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The old butler, "So it's you, sir. The master said that if you came looking for her, I could tell you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carson: ...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, was the old butler pretending to be senile just now?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matty said coldly, "Speak!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The old butler was also acting on someone's orders. Carson's grandfather had instructed him that no one should be told about </span><span>Sumasa's</span><span> background unless her biological father came looking for her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now that </span><span>Sumasa's</span><span> biological father had come looking for him, the old butler had followed his master's instructions and told Matty everything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carson's grandfather was a friend of Sophia's. She had entrusted her child to a female friend to take care of. But when her friend fell ill and couldn't take care of the child, she handed the child over to Carson's grandfather and gave him the money Sophia had left behind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sophia's friend was very resentful of Matty because he had killed her first love in order to be with Sophia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that time, Sophia didn't know anything and thought her first love had left her. Under Matty's slow influence, she fell in love with him, only to find out that Matty couldn't marry her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Sophia became pregnant, Matty forced her to break up with him and marry someone else. Angry, Sophia left him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After the child was born, they encountered enemies of the Wilson family, and Sophia was killed. Knowing everything that had happened, Matty was full of pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought Sophia had sent the child away to take revenge on him, but it turned out to be a helpless act. He hated the S organization even more after seeing what they had done to Sophia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it weren't for Amelia, he would have turned James into a bioengineered person and thrown him into a blender!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matty clenched his fists, his veins bulging, and Carson hung up the phone. Seeing this, he instinctively spoke up for James.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This was all done by the original S organization, and it has nothing to do with James. You..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The original S was called darkness, an organization that had been around for a long time. After all the members of darkness sacrificed themselves, it was renamed the S organization.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for why all the members of this organization sacrificed themselves, why it was renamed, and who was behind it, Erebus had been investigating for many years, but knew nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Darkness was quite powerful and had done some cruel things. But at that time, James hadn't even been born, so how could it all be blamed on him?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They are all the same kind of people!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking that his granddaughter had married such a man, Matty was even more resentful!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But James is Amelia's husband. Don't you think, for Amelia's sake, you should let him go?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matty sneered, "If it weren't for Amelia, do you think he would still be alive now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carson frowned, "Amelia is pregnant with his child now, and when the child is born..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matty interrupted him coldly, "Are you complaining that your relatives have not been treated badly enough by the S organization, or that the Evans family's hatred for your family is not deep enough?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carson was at a loss for words, as he should have hated the Clark family and the Evans family, who were enemies, as well as the S organization. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But at this moment, he didn't know why, his feelings of hatred weren't that strong. </span><span>Could it be because his feelings of guilt towards his sister outweighed his hatred?</span></p></div>
