        <h1>Chapter 1910 Begging Her on His Knees</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The way she asked so cautiously made the tall man lower his proud head: "If that's the case, your chances of survival are only 10%. If we remove it now, it increases to 30%."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With his other hand, James caressed Amelia's face, "Amelia, I don't want you to leave again. So, forget about the child, for now, just focus on staying alive, okay?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After hearing this, Amelia felt as if she had fallen into an ice cave. She hadn't expected that whether she had a child or not, her chances of survival were only between 10% and 30%. No matter what, there was a possibility that she could die. The thought of her own death, and the potential death of her child, filled her with sorrow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had faced life and death, and in truth, she no longer feared the end. But James... She lifted her misty eyes, looking at the man's pale face, "It doesn't matter if I die, but oh, how I hate to leave you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thought of leaving James brought tears to Amelia's eyes. They fell like pearls off a broken string, rolling down her cheeks in big drops.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The warm liquid splashed onto James' hand and undoubtedly felt like a knife slicing through his throat, causing it to tighten and ache.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bearing a pain akin to being scraped by a knife, James grabbed Amelia's hand, placing it over his heart. With an incredibly resolute voice, he asserted powerfully, "I won't let you die."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without his permission, not even the Grim Reaper could take her away. If she must be taken, then he would surely follow, transforming into a demon from hell to slay all the Grim Reapers!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at the man's bloodshot eyes, Amelia helplessly tugged at the corner of her bitter lips, "I've had a heart transplant, and now I have preeclampsia, and a clotting disorder. The chances of survival... probably aren't great, so..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia pushed James's hand away, placing it on her swollen belly. With a look of resolve, she calmly met James's gaze, "If I'm going to die no matter what, I might as well let the child live."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every mother thinks of her child first. Amelia hid the sadness in her eyes and pleaded with James, "Please let me carry to term. That way, even if I die, you'll still have our baby with you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing Amelia's decision, a chill rose from the depths of James's heart, freezing his entire body stiff. He looked at Amelia, who only had the child in her heart, and suddenly, somewhat angrily, he grabbed her chin, forcing her to look at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Amelia, listen to me. Whether the child survives or not, I don't care. The only thing I care about is you. If you're thinking of sacrificing yourself for the child, then you better wait for me in heaven!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These words brought tears to Amelia's eyes again: "James, why are you always so foolish? Even if I'm not around, you still have our baby with you. It's the same."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's different!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James's voice suddenly grew louder, almost roaring in anger: "Without you, nothing makes any sense!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After they got married, James had hardly ever lost his temper with her. This was the first time, and Amelia was somewhat frightened. Her eyes, filled with tears, were fixed on him, but she didn't dare to say another word.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James saw fear for him in her eyes. The man quickly reined in his anger, almost breaking down, pleading with her, "Amelia, I beg you, don't make this choice. I really can't lose you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was truly pleading with her, the endless pain in his eyes revealing that he was in a state worse than death. But for her, their baby was also very important. After all, she had been carrying their child for over seven months...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia lowered her head, torn by indecision, and looked at her protruding belly. The child inside was still moving around in her womb, such a vibrant life. How could she bear to give it up?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Amelia."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James gripped her wrist with one hand, used the other to push off the hospital bed and rise to his feet, then immediately dropped to his knees. Without any hesitation, he knelt straight in front of Amelia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm begging you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he knelt and uttered these words, Amelia's pupils suddenly constricted. Most people wouldn't kneel easily, yet here was this man, radiant as the stars, kneeling before her, pleading.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at James, who was in the depths of despair, Amelia felt a pang of heartache. She forcefully broke free from his grip, grabbed his arm, and tried to help him up. But he </span><span>wouldn't get up, nor would he speak. He just stared at her with eyes full of despair, silently watching her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was as if he wouldn't rise from his knees until she agreed. He was betting on Amelia's compassion for him, and her love for him, and in the end, he won that bet. Amelia lifted his face, staring at his stunningly handsome features, and she gave in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No matter what, we must find a way to keep the child alive."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even in her situation, the chances of the child surviving were slim. But she would do everything in her power, exhaust all means, and seek the best doctors to keep the child alive. If the child couldn't survive, then that 30% hope, for Amelia, was as good as none.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia's compromise was James's salvation. The man's tense body suddenly relaxed. Even though a cesarean section also carried risks, it was still a better chance than a mere 10%. As long as there was hope, he did everything to protect her!</span></p></div>
