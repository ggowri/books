        <h1>Chapter 1945 Matty’s last words</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Neil made the announcement, he handed the crumpled paper back to the baby.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The baby, who had received it, held onto the name with one hand and gripped a knife with the other.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sitting in the dimly lit room, he remained silent, engrossed in his own thoughts.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing the baby like this, everyone felt that the name truly matched his cold personality.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, no one dared to criticize it and instead congratulated James and Amelia, saying they had finally found a name that satisfied the baby.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The only one who held two children, Paul, snorted coldly, "This name is not as good as the one I came up with, Buzz Lightyear. I don't know who came up with such a name..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing these words, the Lawrence family members paused.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dylan instinctively glanced at the door.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The estate was quite large, and it was only from a distance that he could see the figure standing straight outside the iron gate.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matty, wearing a black top hat, looked at the joyful scene inside and also wanted to go in and see how the one-year-old baby had grown.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, he knew that Amelia and the Evans family would not welcome him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After standing still for a while, Matty turned around with his cane and limped towards the direction of his car.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>During his previous confrontation with Master Davies, he had been shot in the leg. Although he had recovered, he was left with a limp.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Being older, whether he limped or not didn't matter much to him. It just meant that he walked a bit slower.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he slowly made his way, James' cold gaze passed through the crowd and glanced at his retreating figure.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, Matty struggled to reach the car door and sat down with a sense of desolation.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was about to ask the driver to start the car when a pair of fair and slender fingers reached out from the window.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Following those clearly defined knuckles, Matty looked over and met a pair of cold and indifferent eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The owner of those eyes lowered their eyelashes slightly and looked at him expressionlessly, saying, "Thank you for what happened earlier."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James was referring to the incident in the operating room and saving Amelia's life, but it ended there.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After speaking, James turned and walked away, but Matty stopped him, "I found a doctor who can stabilize the chip in your brain. As long as your tumor doesn't recur, it won't affect the chip. You can live long enough to see your child grow up."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James paused for a moment, slightly turning his gaze to the already moving car, but he </span><span>didn't say anything.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stood still for two seconds, then continued walking towards the mansion.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's name was chosen by Matty, and James already knew, but Amelia didn't.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James hadn't told Amelia and hadn't renamed the child, implying his acceptance.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dylan said that now, aside from not welcoming Matty, the Evans family didn't have much hostility towards them.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Rebecca was still waiting for an explanation from Matty.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After returning home, Matty made arrangements with the doctor to follow James for the rest of his life and paid for it permanently.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He instructed the doctor to take good care of James and Amelia's health.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After arranging the doctor, he handed over the stewardship of the Lawrence family to Dylan, along with Owen's assistance in managing the Sherman Group and the Lawrence family.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He also transferred all his personal assets to Amelia.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matty instructed Dylan, "I'm afraid Amelia won't accept my things. Give them to her after I'm gone. Also, you three brothers must be her strong support."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Dylan, Owen, and Eugene exchanged glances, Dylan reached out and took the will document. "Grandfather, although the Evans family forced you to commit suicide, now that we have established a good relationship with them, the situation will eventually ease."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sitting at the desk, Matty took off his wire-rimmed glasses and put them in a box. Then he raised his gaze and looked at his three grandsons. "I have done everything I should do in this world. There is nothing worth clinging to, so it's time to apologize to your grandmother."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was him who killed Daley, leading to Sophia's tragic death. He was guilty and had to seek redemption.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After finishing his words, Matty stood up from the desk and instructed Owen, "I know you don't want to manage the company. If you don't mind the distribution of power, then from now on, you can leave the company matters to Dylan."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing this, the burden on Owen's shoulders suddenly eased. "Grandfather, you know, under your guidance, we, the descendants of the Lawrence family, don't like power struggles. In my heart, no matter what others say, you are the most open-minded elder who always considers the future generations."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eugene also chimed in, "Yes, if possible, grandfather, please wait a little longer. Use the time ahead to get closer to Amelia. She will definitely see your good qualities, and maybe in the future, she will forgive you."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matty lit a cigarette, held it in his mouth, and smiled, "My subordinate implanted a virus chip in her husband's brain. It can take his life at any time. How can she forgive me?"</span></p></div>
