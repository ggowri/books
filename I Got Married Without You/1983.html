        <h1>Chapter 1983 Miss Him</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James rubbed against her neck and said, "I'm not someone who's afraid of death, but for some reason, after being with you, I always cherish my life."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was because he cherished his life that he had searched the world for doctors and medicine, but he never got the desired result. It seemed that as time passed, James had no choice...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia panicked and hugged James tightly, feeling as if every word James said was bidding her farewell, making her feel very uncomfortable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her fingers were placed on the back of James' head, gently stroking him over and over again. "You have Alexander and me, so you must cherish your life. Otherwise, what should we do?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James didn't tell Amelia what to do this time. Forcibly holding on for five years, he could increasingly feel that his life was passing...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The increasing number of headaches had made him reach the point of tossing and turning. James may have passed away before he could wait to remove the chip. He just needed to arrange everything before leaving...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James felt very heavy. But the most reluctant thing he thought of was Amelia, who was in his arms. As he felt her crying silently again, he lowered his head, grabbed her lips, and deeply kissed her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was another unforgettable intimacy. It seemed that such intimacy could alleviate their painful emotions. The two of them lingered in this physical fusion day and night.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Until Amelia couldn't bear it anymore, he let her go but refused to leave her body. James cherished it and leaned over Amelia, letting her sleep on him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stared at her face, which had not been left by time, under the moonlight shining into the ship and whispered, "Honey, I want you to be with me in the next life. But you promised Ryan the next life before."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia, who had not fallen asleep yet, pressed herself against his chest and whispered, "In this life, if you leave before me, then in the next life, I will never allow you..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James felt a bit sad and hugged Amelia tightly. "After so many years, you are still so ruthless. Don't you know that your husband will be jealous?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia's tears flowed down her face. "Then you live well, I promise you everything in my next life and eternity, okay?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His sad emotions quietly dissipated. "Eternal life seems very long. I want you in the next life. That's enough..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia no longer replied, nestled in his arms, gazing at the bright moon in the night sky, praying in her heart, "Let James live longer, and I am willing to trade my own life for it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, things did not go as she had hoped. James' headache symptoms had already erupted to the point where he could not stop with medication. He almost felt the pain until he could not sleep all night, tossing and turning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia could only stand by the bed every night, tears streaming down her face as she watched the man holding his head in pain, his face turning pale, and his whole body curled up in a ball.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She reached out her hand to help James massage and alleviate the pain. But as long as Amelia put her finger on his head, he could feel the pain until he fainted, so she dared not even touch him again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After each coma, James, who came to his senses, would hug her who had been frightened. He disregarded the pain and reassured Amelia again and again, saying, "I'm okay. There's nothing."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amidst these comforts, Amelia gradually became dazed and lived a whole day in terror, afraid of losing James. Every time he made any movement, she was so scared that she trembled all over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James probably saw Amelia like this and asked the doctor to increase the dosage. But it could easily lead to side effects. As the dosage expired one day, he would experience even more pain, but James did not care at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The doctor had no choice but to increase the medication to suppress his headache symptoms. As the symptoms subsided, James lied to Amelia, telling her that he would no longer have headaches and asking her not to worry anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia did not believe his words and still did not sleep every night. She stayed by his bed until she saw him sleeping soundly every night and gradually felt at ease.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James stabilized slightly and rushed from Jiollerk to Canada. It had been five years since Alexander had been immersed in the laboratory, studying world problems with scholars, and he had never returned home.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They really missed him. Especially Amelia, in the first three years, as James had less obvious headache symptoms, she would occasionally make video calls to Alexander, but Alexander was too busy and often couldn't get through.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia missed him very much and had wanted to visit him many times, but Alexander said that even if they came, he would not have time to meet them, so Alexander asked them to wait for him to graduate at home. Now, James was just taking her to visit him quietly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Peter bought a house not far from the school for the convenience of taking care of Alexander, but Alexander often stayed in the laboratory and hardly came back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Peter asked Alexander to call him as he wanted to go home, and he went to pick him up. For the past five years, Alexander had always called Peter before returning home after finishing his work. But this time, he forgot, and an accident happened.</span></p></div>
