        <h1>Chapter 1942 There is no more sorry</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva could tell what Amelia was thinking, and suddenly she spoke with a serious tone, "Amelia, in the past six months, James has tried every possible way to wake you up. From his words and actions, I can see that he loves you even more than Ryan does. So from now on, be a little nicer to him and let him feel the warmth of being loved by family."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Amelia nodded and gently lowered her gaze, she looked at the sleepy baby in her arms and said softly, "Now, my world only consists of him and the baby. Of course, I will do my best to treat him well. It's just that..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her eyes filled with mist and her heart ached uncontrollably. "Eva, he still has a chip in his brain, and I'm afraid that one day he will..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva quickly reached out and placed her hand on Amelia's shoulder, gently patting to comfort her. "Amelia, the doctor said as long as he doesn't move, there won't be any problems. Besides, Paul and other friends and sisters are looking for doctors. With so much support, nothing will happen."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia responded with a sigh, and tears of heartache still fell. "I hope we can find a doctor soon and remove that chip. Then he won't be in so much pain..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While others worried about James' life being threatened, Amelia was afraid that James would be in pain.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva knew that only a wife would feel such heartache for her husband. "As long as you're by his side, he won't feel any pain."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For James, his biggest fear was not the physical pain, but being abandoned by Amelia. What did a little physical pain matter to him?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking of this, Eva thought of Ryan, the young man who loved Amelia in the same way.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wondered if he, who suffered from severe depression, was licking his wounds alone again.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feeling guilty, Eva took out her phone while Amelia was lost in thought, and sent a message to Ryan: [Ryan, she has woken up, so don't worry.]</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Eva suddenly take out her phone and type with a serious expression, Amelia vaguely guessed who she was messaging.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a moment of silence, Amelia apologized, "Eva, please tell Ryan that I'm really sorry."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had temporary amnesia, and the things she said must have caused him a lot of trouble. Plus, he developed depression because of her. Amelia felt even more guilty...</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva glanced at her and then lowered her head to quickly type another line: [Also, she has regained her memory. She asked me to apologize to you. I hope you don't mind.]</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ryan, sitting in the study, stared at the message for a long time before replying: [Tell her that I lost my memory once, and now she has lost hers. We're even. She shouldn't feel guilty towards me anymore.]</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After seeing this message, Eva's eyes welled up with tears. Before she could reply, Ryan sent another message: [Eva, I wish you happiness, and I wish her happiness too.]</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unable to hold back, Eva's tears fell as she typed: [Ryan, from childhood to now, you have taken care of her and helped her. Even I can't let go of that. How could she?]</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ryan looked out at the snow falling outside the window and sent one last message: [Between her and me, there is no more sorry.]</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he had the accident, he should have died, but James saved him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he tried to commit suicide, James saved him again, James also regained him the family's rights.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These were enough to repay the childhood favor Amelia owed to him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since James had repaid Ryan's favor to Amelia, it was only natural for James to have Amelia.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Ryan still needed to explain himself so that he could completely bridge the gap between James and Amelia.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When James was about to return to the hospital room, his phone vibrated. He took it out and glanced at the message from Ryan: [After she lost her memory, she only remembered things before she turned eighteen. The love between her and you was too painful compared to the past, so she remembers not me, but those carefree years.]</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[Let me tell you a secret, I liked her first. Throughout, she had more of a familial love for me than romantic love. And you, she actively liked and fell in love with.]</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After reading these two messages, James' expression became cold and somewhat complicated.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ryan was removing the thorn from his heart, but James had known since the moment Amelia said she was willing to die with him that she loved him more.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't need anyone to explain it to him, but he respected Ryan's good intentions.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a moment of silence, James picked up his phone and replied: [I understand. Thank you.]</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After replying, the man put away his phone, picked up his pace, and walked into the hospital room.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Amelia holding the baby and smiling at Eva, he couldn't help but ask, "What are you talking about? You look so happy."</span></p></div>
