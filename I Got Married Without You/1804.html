        <h1>Chapter 1804 A chance to explain</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without waiting for Paul to get angry, Eva grabbed his arm and coaxed him softly, "Paul, I was just joking, don't be mad." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eugene glanced at her belly and then left the ward gracefully, catching up with Owen and Dylan's footsteps.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul couldn't resist Eva's coquettishness. She acted cute and he couldn't stay mad at her. He put his arm around her waist and said authoritatively, "Don't chase after these kinds of celebrities in the future." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva nodded three times in agreement, and then Paul carried the thermos and led her into the ward. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After they went in, Eva, feeling excited, walked up to Amelia and asked, "Amelia, just now Eugene called you his cousin, does that mean he and you are siblings?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia had heard the conversation outside, so she nodded and handed the paternity test report to Eva, saying, "That's what it says in here." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva took the report, read it, and then patted Amelia's hand, saying, "Amelia, no wonder you've always been so beautiful, it's all in the genes." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia pointed to her forehead and said, "You only think I'm pretty because you saw Eugene, right?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva waved her hand, "I've always thought you were beautiful, much better than Eugene. They came to acknowledge you as their relative, right?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia nodded, "I don't want to go back and acknowledge them, so the three brothers came to persuade me." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva patted Amelia's hand, "Whatever decision you make, I won't interfere, I'll just support you." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia hugged her and said, "Eva, you're so good to me." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva comforted her, "Amelia, it's great that you've finally found your family." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she didn't know anything, and couldn't help feeling a little lonely and lost. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul noticed her sadness and immediately said, "You have me, you have Amelia, that's enough. You don't need to pay attention to those who abandoned you." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia felt Paul was right, "The director said that it was your parents who disguised themselves and abandoned the child at the orphanage. They basically abandoned us, so we don't need to care." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She finished speaking and then patted Eva's belly, "You have me, you have Paul, and in the future, you'll have a child. Together, we'll be your family, that's enough." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva sighed, "Forget it, let's not talk about sad things, let's eat." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva had cooked before she came, and she had made a pot of hot chicken soup to nourish Amelia. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul was now taking it out of the thermos and placing it on the table. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva helped Amelia up from the bed and then helped her sit at the table. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul, who was serving the soup, was watching Amelia's reaction. "Amelia, the address you provided, Andrew went to look for it. The reward is in an old warehouse, and there are hardly any people around, so it's very difficult to find their location." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul had learned from Eva that James had divorced Amelia, and now he was talking about it, a little cautiously, afraid that Amelia would mind. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Amelia didn't resist, she just frowned slightly, "Erebus is indeed very secretive, so many people haven't found a trace." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul saw that she didn't mind, so he continued, "James had sent people to search in Gold Sea before, but they didn't find anything, so Andrew thinks it's there and went to look again." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gold Sea was an unregulated area, very chaotic, and a casino run by dark forces like Erebus should be built there, but it's particularly hidden and difficult to find. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia just made a sound of agreement and didn't say anything else. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul looked at her face again and said, "Amelia, James loves you so much, he would never abandon you." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mentioning him made Amelia's heart ache, but she still smiled at Paul and said, "I know." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul breathed a sigh of relief and said, "So... when he comes back safely, can you give him a chance to explain?"</span></p></div>
