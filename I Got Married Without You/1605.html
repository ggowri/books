        <h1>Chapter 1605 More hidden truth</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"These old matters?" Stella sneered suddenly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is it just a small matter that you had someone gang rape me?" Karen's face turned cold in response to Stella's attitude.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I already said, I was confused at the time, it wasn't intentional," Karen tried to justify herself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What a statement, Karen really thought Stella was a fool?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stella's tiny bit of affection for Karen turned into nothingness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She slowly turned her head, her face equally cold, looking down at Karen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You say you haven't killed anyone, then how did Bart die?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Karen's face darkened, and she suddenly glanced at Mike sitting silently beside her. If it weren't for this bastard causing trouble, she wouldn't have let Stella, that little girl, notice what she had done.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How should I know how he died?" Karen refused to admit it, but Stella didn't care.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I will find out," Stella declared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing this, Karen stopped pretending and directly laughed coldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What will you do once you find out?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Once I find out the truth..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stella squinted her reddened eyes, stared at the scorching sun outside the window, and said coldly, "I will personally send you to prison."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Karen didn't believe that Stella had the ability to do such a thing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, go ahead and investigate then."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bart had a stroke, she just removed the oxygen tank, no one saw it, and she didn't believe Stella could find out unless a dead person spoke up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stella stopped talking to her, picked up her bag and started to leave, but Karen stopped her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stella, since you're back, let's have a meal first. After all, I've been good to you all </span><span>these years... sincerely."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was using delaying tactics, trying to keep Stella, even though she knew Stella already hated her and would never forgive her. Karen wanted to take this opportunity to send someone to erase what she had done.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stella had no intention of staying, clutching her bag, she confronted Karen who stood in her way. "What, do you have more truths to tell me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Karen crossed her arms and nodded at her. "</span><span>Of course</span><span> I do."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After confidently speaking, Karen raised her chin arrogantly towards Stella. "Do you know why Erin wanted to terminate your pregnancy?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stella's body stiffened. Erin said they hated the child, that's why they wanted to get rid of it. Was there some hidden truth behind this?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Karen said she would tell Stella if she stayed for the meal. Stella compromised for this one truth. When they sat down at the restaurant, Stella noticed Karen sending a servant out to do something. She pretended not to see it, since everything useful was in her own bag.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Stella sit down, Karen muttered, "When you were pregnant, the doctor said you had a severe infection in your uterus, and it needed to be terminated immediately. I didn't tell you because it was a way to force the Simpson family's people to drive Erin away..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was probably the most malicious thing Stella had ever heard. Karen knew she had a serious infection, but still planned to use her for her own benefit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stella's hands trembled uncontrollably. No wonder Erin immediately took her to have an abortion after the examination. She had already been infected, but she thought Erin hated her, which was why they wanted to get rid of the child...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stella lowered her reddened eyes, carefully contemplating. She then remembered what Erin had said at that time. Erin said if she didn't terminate the pregnancy, she would be infected to death. But at that time, Stella was blinded by hatred and didn't investigate the meaning of those words. She only thought Erin was making excuses...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As these details became clearer, she felt her heart being pierced by a thousand arrows. So, it wasn't Erin's deliberate surgery that caused the infection, she had been infected from the beginning...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If an infected uterus wasn't removed, she would surely die. But at that time, how did she not notice these problems...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Stella raised her eyelashes, tears fell down like raindrops.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The person who abandoned me in the wilderness, was it you..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Erin didn't terminate her pregnancy out of hatred, dislike, or revenge, but to save her life. Yet, how could the same person who just performed the surgery abandon her in the wilderness? It definitely wasn't Erin, only Karen would do such a thing...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As expected, while Karen elegantly savored her delicious steak, her expression remained emotionless as she nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If I didn't do that, how could you hate Erin and wish for his death?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stella's hatred towards Erin was the best revenge for him. After all, which man could endure a woman he loved hating him endlessly?</span></p></div>
