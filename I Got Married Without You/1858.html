        <h1>Chapter 1858: Can't Amelia Worry About Me?</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Erebus' signals are blocked too, I can't reach anyone inside," Carson added apologetically. James' expression turned indifferent. As he sought a way out, so did Matty, and it was a race to see who would outsmart the other first.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since he couldn't rescue Amelia ahead of time, he'd have to defuse the bomb first. As long as Matty didn't hold his life in his hands, he could save Amelia. With that thought, James ended the call and looked at Paul: "If we can't stop the detonation, at least delay it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Give me some time, I'll figure out a way to shut it down," Paul, who was working on a simulation, said steadfastly. His eyes could hardly stay open, but he was determined.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't just want to shut it down. Like hacking into surveillance and tracking systems, he wanted to alter the program after cracking it, encrypting it so it couldn't be restarted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While rapidly typing in codes, Paul eyed the man opposite him, who was resting his chin on his hand, deep in thought. He had been wondering whether to tell James about Amelia's trip to Canada to meet her relatives, but it turned out James already knew and had even met Amelia in Erebus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Had he not heard James on the phone, he wouldn't have known that Amelia's grandfather was the founder of Erebus, let alone that Amelia was trapped there. Thinking of Amelia's current situation, Paul was also very worried. But Matty was Amelia's grandfather, wouldn't he harm his own kin, right?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Paul was lost in thought, he heard James' indifferent voice: "Don't tell Eva about the chip in my head."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"James, are you afraid that if Eva knew, she'd tell Amelia?" Paul looked at James over his screen, his expression solemn. James didn't respond, which was confirmation enough.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"James, wouldn't it be okay for Amelia to worry about you? Why keep it from her?" Paul didn't understand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it was a minor injury, it'd be alright for her to worry a little. But a chip in his brain was a matter of life and death. Why would James let Amelia worry over this?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, he didn't know if Amelia would come back after being rescued. If not, it'd be better for her not to know. Why make her worry about a man who was as good as dead?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, the thought of her not coming back caused a dull pain in James' heart. Despite wanting to hold onto her for a lifetime, he felt powerless, unable to grasp her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When James fell silent, the loneliness that radiated from him seemed unbearable to Paul. Maybe Amelia could save him, but would she come back? Everything was uncertain. Paul didn't understand what had happened between them, but he knew what needed to be done - disable the bomb system and buy time for James to exact his </span><span>revenge and save people.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul spent two days and nights creating a simulation to find the bomb system set up by Matty. After countless attempts at decoding and decrypting, he finally succeeded. However, he could only delay the detonation, not disable the system. The enemy could still reset the timer or activate the bomb system directly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On learning that James' hacker had breached and modified the surveillance and tracking system, and even the bomb program, Matty rushed to the control room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Erebus's programmers were still working on decrypting the system sent by Paul. It wasn't difficult, but every time they broke through, a message would pop up on the screen - "Go to hell, one day I'll take you idiots down."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing this sentence, Matty surprisingly smiled appreciatively, "This kid keeps breaking my codes, I wish he worked for Erebus."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But if they've broken our surveillance and tracking system, we won't know when he's coming back. What do we do?" The operator next to him, far from appreciating the situation, looked worried.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Knowing how James operates, he'll be back with his crew tomorrow." Matty, arms crossed, turned to the worried operator.</span></p></div>
