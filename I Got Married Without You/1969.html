        <h1>Chapter 1969 Passed the IQ Test</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chloe had worked with many children with autism and knew they often didn't respond to conversation. So, without waiting for a reply, she just continued speaking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your mother is worried you might be autistic, so she asked me to help talk things out with you. But I don't think you're autistic. I think you're just brilliant. We should test how smart, though. Are you up for that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chloe spoke to Alexander with the straightforwardness of an adult, which finally earned her a look from him as if wondering, "How would we test that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing the eagerness in Alexander's eyes, Chloe became even more convinced of his brilliance. She ensured it was likely causing him to admire the intelligence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without guidance, such children didn't know how to learn correctly. They mimicked the intelligence, learned from books, and absorbed from their secluded worlds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Convinced of her assessment, Chloe pulled out her smartphone, opened the challenging IQ test questions, and held the screen in front of Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Here are some tough questions, tricky even for many adults. Can you solve them?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander initially showed no interest, but upon hearing that even adults couldn't solve the puzzle, he inexplicably raised his eyes and glanced at the phone screen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he saw the first question, unable to resist the urge, he reached out, snatched Chloe's phone, and hugged it close. He lowered his head and began to answer the questions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While he was engrossed in the puzzle, Chloe refrained from disturbing him and settled opposite him. She picked up the scattered books and high-tech models, examining them one by one.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The time she seemed to slip away unnoticed until Chloe felt a gentle tap on her arm from the phone. Looking up, she met the gaze of Alexander, whose chin was held high, his eyes condescendingly surveying her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Looks like you passed the test."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander remained silent, and Chloe didn't mind. She reached out and took the phone, glancing at the screen. It was indeed a passing score on an IQ test, but to get a precise assessment, he would need to visit a professional institution.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Alexander Evans, you're undoubtedly smart, a real little genius. But you're still a bit behind some other geniuses."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Where are they?" Alexander's arrogant expression immediately fell when he heard someone was better than him, and his eyes flickered with defiance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They are in my institution," Chloe replied. "If you are interested, we can arrange a time for me to take you to meet them."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After finishing speaking, Chloe got up and walked away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at her back, Alexander, averse to asking for favors, nonetheless spoke up. "I'm free now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing Alexander's words, Chloe turned back and offered him a warm, gentle smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then let's go."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia was surprised to hear Chloe say that her child had a very high IQ and was a genius. She knew Alexander was brilliant, but she had never thought of him as a genius. Now that Chloe proposed to take the child to a professional institution for testing, she was utterly stunned, especially after the professional test and the results came out...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mrs. Evans, your son has no psychological issues. It's just that his IQ is exceptionally high, exceeding 150. With such a high IQ, he will likely feel that everyone around him is a fool."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia stared at the test results for a long time, struggling to accept the fact that her son was indeed a genius. But once she did, she was plunged into a state of uncertainty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Does he... think I'm an idiot too?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She often talked to Alexander, and he would usually ignore her. At that time, did Alexander also think of her as an idiot?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Compared to him, if you talk to him in the way you talk to a child, then he will think you are an idiot."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These words left Amelia completely perplexed. Thankfully, Chloe was there to explain that the specialist doctor, despite having an IQ of over 138, often lacked emotional intelligence and struggled with social communication. However, there was no malice in his words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia didn't mind whether the doctor had emotional intelligence or not. What bothered her was that Alexander would think of everyone around him as fools. He was only five years old! He would grow up to be even more inarticulate than the doctor!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia couldn't quite wrap her mind around it, but the verdict was in. There was no use in denying it. As they stepped out of the professional institution, Amelia bid farewell to Chloe and turned her gaze towards Alexander, who settled into the car with an air of detached coolness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She stared at Alexander while silently reminding herself never to treat him like a child again lest she was deemed an idiot by a child.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia sent the test results to James, who was in a meeting at the company. He didn't seem too surprised, simply replying: [He is my son. He is certainly different from the rest.]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia quickly typed: [Chloe says that geniuses tend to be arrogant and that it's not a good thing. She thinks we, as parents, need to guide him properly, or else he might go astray when he grows up!]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James, while listening to the financial report data, immediately replied to Amelia: [Don't worry, honey. I'll be home as soon as the meeting ends.]</span></p></div>
