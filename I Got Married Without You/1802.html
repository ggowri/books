        <h1>Chapter 1802 Amelia refused to go back to the Lawrence Family</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The way men and women approached their ideas about love was different, and Dylan cannot fully understand Amelia's perspective. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He simply said, "I don't know what Sophia was thinking at the time. If you want to know the specific reasons, come back with me and ask my grandfather." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia handed the report back to Dylan and said, "Dylan, thank you for coming to see me and letting me know about my mother's background." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dylan's face stiffened, "Cousin, I came to do the identification for you, not just to let you know about your mother's background, but also to take you back to the Lawrence family." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia smiled, "Thank you for your kindness, but I have my own home now." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dylan looked at her abdomen and said, "Although you are married, it doesn't prevent you from returning to the Lawrence family to recognize your relatives." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia replied, "I think it's enough for us to know who each other is. There's no need to recognize each other." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was not surprising that Amelia was indifferent to family ties, mainly because she didn't feel much affection when she was young, and now that she was past the age of longing for family affection, she didn&rsquo;t care too much. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dylan still wanted to persuade her, and Amelia said, "You said that the decision is up to me after the identification results come out, so my decision is not to go back to the </span><span>Lawrence family with you." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dylan asked, "Is it because my grandfather didn't marry Sophia, you think he's a bit unfeeling, that's why you refuse me?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia neither nodded nor shook her head, "I don't know about what happened between your grandfather and your grandmother, and I have no comment, but his actions were indeed a bit inappropriate." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dylan agreed, "I also think what he did was wrong. If it were me, I wouldn't let my family force me to do anything." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia smiled, "Then why didn't you marry the person you wanted to marry?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had heard from Edith that Dylan's love interest was already married, so he must have had a story of his own. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dylan shrugged helplessly, "She didn't like me. I couldn't force her to marry me, could I?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was quite humorous, and Amelia's eyes curved into an arc. "You are quite respectful of others." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dylan said, "I have no choice. My mother and father taught me not to take advantage of my power to seize things by force." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, Amelia thought the Lawrence family was not bad, but even if she had a good impression, she wouldn't recognize them. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dylan understood her thoughts and didn't immediately force her, but instead advised her to rest well before leaving to make a phone call. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia thought Dylan respected her decision, but the next day at noon, she saw Dylan with the Lawrence family's eldest and second young masters at the door. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The eldest, Owen, was well-dressed, with a sharp appearance and a strong aura, clearly exuding the demeanor of a corporate president. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The second young master, Eugene... </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia was stunned. She had no concept of celebrities before, but upon seeing the Lawrence family's second young master, she was instantly captivated, as if a breath of fresh air had brushed her face. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His outstanding features, perfect facial structure, and thick eyebrows also gave off a soft ripple, as if he was always smiling. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Eugene saw Amelia staring at him in a daze, he raised his elegant hand and waved to her, "Hi, little cousin, I'm your cousin, Eugene." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia snapped out of her daze and forced a stiff smile, "Hello."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Compared to Owen, Eugene was much more at ease. He naturally sat down at Amelia's bedside and reached out to shake her hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Out of politeness, Amelia shook his hand and remained silent. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing her bewildered expression, Eugene found it cute, "The few girls adopted by my family are not as pretty as you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He not only spoke well, but his voice was also full of magnetism. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No wonder Eugene was an international superstar, exuding charm that attracted the opposite sex in every move. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fortunately, Amelia had seen James' appearance and was not dazzled, "You are quite handsome too."</span></p></div>
