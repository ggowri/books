        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man turned around and saw Hugh carrying a medical kit, rushing towards them with heavy steps.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James quickly stepped forward and grabbed Hugh's wrist, pulling him into the operating room...</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hugh glanced at Amelia's condition and realized that her heart had only stopped, she hadn't experienced brain death yet.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He swiftly took the hemostatic forceps and began to stop the bleeding...</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Everyone, get out!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Nurse, clean up the operating room!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Doctors, come and assist me!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Hugh continued to stop the bleeding, he ordered the half-strangled Dr. Tenny:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"After I stop the bleeding, you continue with defibrillation until the mother's heartbeat is restored!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Hugh's arrival, the entire operating room once again became chaotic.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They all put in their utmost effort to save someone who had just entered the gates of death...</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, James and the latecomer Eva didn't want to leave.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They wanted to stay by Amelia's side, but Paul forcefully pulled them out...</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the group of people anxiously waited outside the operating room, Dominic, with a cold face, turned around and walked through the corridor, entering the operating room through another passage.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hugh, save the baby first."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hugh, who was busy saving Amelia, paused for a moment when he heard Dominic's voice. Then, in disbelief, he looked up at Dominic.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dominic, an adult's life is more important than a child's."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I know, but she's already dead. It's not worth wasting time trying to save her. The baby's heartbeat is still there, just not breathing. With your skills, you can definitely revive the baby..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's just a cardiac arrest. If we act within the critical time frame, we can continue with CPR and save her."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She's bleeding uncontrollably. Even if we revive her, she'll only live for a short while. It's better to use this time to save the baby."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a moment of hesitation, Hugh's actions didn't stop. In just a short moment, he managed to stop the bleeding in Amelia's uterus.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hugh, we've been friends for many years."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Listening to Dominic's words, Hugh struggled internally for a while before handing the hemostatic forceps back to Dr. Tenny.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You handle the bleeding in Amelia's abdomen. Other doctors, increase the defibrillation power and never give up!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying that, he quickly walked to Dr. Gilbert's side, reached out and took the baby, placing it in his palm.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He used his thumb to press on the baby's heart, alternating between the front and back, and then started patting...</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dr. Tenny still couldn't stop the bleeding. He kept looking at Hugh, hoping that this respected senior in the field of gynecology could come and help.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But clearly, Hugh, who was stretched thin, could only focus on the baby...</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James, outside the operating room, saw Dominic instructing Hugh to save the baby first through the glass. He fell into despair.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately, the operating room door was locked from the inside by Dominic's people...</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James clenched his fists and desperately pounded on the operating room door.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The doctors and nurses inside wanted to open the door when they saw him, but a sharp look from Dominic made them hesitate.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anyone who dares to open it, I'll make sure they never see the sun tomorrow!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The people inside didn't dare to move. James' hands were covered in blood as he pounded, abandoning all dignity, begging Dominic...</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Grandfather, I beg you, save my wife first..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva, who was already crying uncontrollably, cried even harder when she heard James' weak plea to Dominic.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul's eyes were also red as he pleaded with Dominic.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Grandfather, please have mercy on James. Let Hugh save Amelia first. We're begging you..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To Dominic, Amelia was not important. James' son was the most important.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Faced with the pleas of his two grandsons, he resolutely turned around and refused to look at them.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James looked at that determined figure, despair filling his eyes. Through the thick window, he looked at the woman lying on the operating table.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>You live, I live.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>You die, I die.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia, wait for me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When James decided to sacrifice himself, a voice that had weathered the test of time echoed in the corridor:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"James, step aside, I'll break the door!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing the voice, James turned his head and saw Matty leading the Lawrence family, Carson leading the Clark family, Johnny with bodyguards, and rows of doctors in white coats walking quickly towards him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing them, James didn't hesitate. He swayed his body and took a step aside...</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, as long as Amelia could be saved, even if they were enemies, he would trust them.</span></p></div>
