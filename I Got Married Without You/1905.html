        <h1>Chapter 1905 She Fell Down</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James, struggling to keep his emotions in check, instinctively took a step forward, as if he wanted to get a clear look at the child. His waist slowly bent forward in the process.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though James was good at controlling his emotions, Amelia, who knew him well, could still see the touch of emotion in his eyes. She reached out, took his slender hand, and placed it on her belly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The spot where he rested his palm was exactly where the baby's fingers were moving. Their hands, separated only by the belly, were pressed closely together. It was as if the child was greeting its father, a silent and perfect understanding between them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James felt the tiny hand on his palm, and the tears he had barely managed to hold back welled up in his eyes again, especially when he heard Amelia ask him, "Isn't our baby adorable?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could feel his heart tightening. If it weren't for the presence of the dean, he would have certainly held Amelia, laying on her belly without care for appearances, feeling their child while telling her, "I love you both so much."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James's excitement was evident in his slightly trembling fingers. Yet, he was afraid of losing his composure and tried hard to control it. Amelia looked at this man and couldn't help but smile, "Do you think it's a boy or a girl?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James' affectionate gaze moved to the ultrasound screen, staring at the clearly visible baby for a long time. Unable to tell whether it was a boy or a girl, he said, "Whether it's a boy or a girl, as long as it's a child you've given birth to, I'll love them."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The main reason was because the child's mother was Amelia. Any man who loved her would naturally love everything about her. As for the child, to James, it was the embodiment of their love. It was important, but not as important as Amelia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia's thoughts were the exact opposite of James'. She loved James, and she loved their children just as much. The result was always the same, whether the child was a boy or a girl. As long as it was James' child, she loved them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The couple could have easily asked the dean to find out the gender of their child, but they chose not to. To them, the gender didn't matter. All they cared about was the child being healthy. Everything else, they decided, would be a delightful surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thankfully, after a series of tests, the child was healthy and had no issues. All they needed was a follow-up check next time. James then helped Amelia into the car and they headed home.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After they returned, a somewhat tired and sleepy Amelia dozed off on the small sofa. When she woke up, she just happened to see James coming out of the shower. The man was only wrapped in a towel, his upper body exposed. His skin was fair and slightly flushed, incredibly enticing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a while, Amelia shifted her gaze to the shoulder. Whether it was the shoulder or the chest, they were all gunshot wounds. The back was even worse, densely covered with tiny scars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every time she looked, her heart ached. Unable to bear it any longer, Amelia threw off the blanket, got up from the sofa, walked over, and hugged James from behind. "Don't get hurt anymore," she pleaded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man, drying his hair with a towel, felt the warmth radiating from his back. A slight smile tugged at his lips. He then put down the towel, turned around, and wrapped his arms around </span><span>Amelia, pulling her into his embrace. "Don't worry," he reassured her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James still had a chip in his brain, he didn't know how much longer he had to live, and he didn't dare to make too many promises. All he could do was hold the woman in his arms tightly, filled with guilt: "Amelia, I'm sorry. I always make you worry, and you've suffered so much because of me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even when Amelia went for her prenatal check-ups, it was his first time accompanying her. She had to endure all the hardships of early pregnancy alone. Not only did he not help, but he also hurt her twice emotionally. As a husband, he was quite a failure for behaving this way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia inhaled the faint scent that wafted off the man after his bath, feeling a sense of peace. She didn't feel tired at all. "As long as you stay with me for the rest of our lives, I won't feel worried or weary," she said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James stiffened slightly. After a few seconds, his slender fingers moved from his lower back to the top of her head, gently caressing it with a tender touch. He didn't do anything else, nor did he say anything more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Amelia was about to ask him why he wasn't speaking, a gentle male voice came from above her, "Alright, I promise you, I'll stay by your side, for a lifetime."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A content Amelia tiptoed up and kissed James on the lips, "I saw two baby rooms at Eva's today. I'm thinking of designing one and decorating it a bit. What do you think?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Such a gentle kiss, how could James be satisfied? He held Amelia, bent down to lightly bite her lip, then passionately kissed her for a while before he finally let go and responded, "You can do whatever you want."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia started preparing the baby's room, designing two plans, one for a girl and one for a boy. Then she began to decorate. James wasn't idle either, he personally went to pick out baby items, such as clothes, pants, bottles, baby beds, and so on...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After the couple had prepared everything they could possibly need, they began to patiently wait for the birth of their baby. However, despite being extremely careful, Amelia still accidentally fell.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That night, there was a bit of a hiccup at the Evans Group's experimental center. Christopher gave James a call, asking for his help. After instructing the servants to keep a close eye on Amelia, he made a trip to the company.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he returned after sorting things out, he found Amelia collapsed on the bathroom floor, unable to move. James was terrified, his face turning pale. He scooped her up and, like a madman, rushed her to the hospital.</span></p></div>
