        <h1>Chapter 1207 Don’t give me up, Amelia</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This statement undoubtedly hit James hard, like a gunshot, making every breath painful for him: "So, Amelia, are you thinking of giving up on me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he asked this question, his clear peach blossom eyes, as cold as snow, were filled with glistening tears, as if he would cry if Shu Wan nodded even slightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia felt that James didn't fully trust her, perhaps because she didn't provide enough security for him, which made him so afraid of losing her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, if Herb hadn't told her in advance that one of the three sisters was not from the Clark family, she would have chosen to give up on James.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In her opinion, siblings cannot be together. Her moral values do not allow her to do so, and she cannot live with her own brother.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James thought she had agreed since she remained silent, and his body went cold, and his heart stopped beating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He lowered his head, and in his despairing eyes, only her face could be seen: "Amelia, without you, I would die."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had said this sentence many times, and every time it moved her deeply, "But I am the same, aren't I?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just a sentence like this could relieve the pain in his heart that made him suffocate. Amelia was really his destiny.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He raised his hand and stroked her eyebrows and eyes, "Since you feel the same way, can you not easily give up on me because of these things?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia nodded at him and said, "I won't give up on you. And I suspect that my mother is not from the Clark family. Herb told me that one of the three sisters, Alice, Ashley, and Sumasa, is not from the Clark family. So, honey, let's do a DNA test now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James, who heard this sentence, gradually lost the painful expression in his eyes...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why didn't you tell me earlier?" He was almost scared to death just now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia blamed him with a tilted head, "I just wanted to tell you, but you interrupted me, and you interrupted me twice. How can I tell you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It turned out that she just wanted to talk about this matter. He thought she wanted to ask for a divorce or say something hurtful to him, so he interrupted her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After he learned about this matter, his tense nerves suddenly relaxed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He put down the barrier with his slender hand and said coldly to Andrew, "Go to the hospital right away."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Andrew replied, "Yes," and the car turned around and headed straight to Stella's hospital.</span></p></div>
