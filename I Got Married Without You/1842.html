        <h1>Chapter 1842: Hopes Were Crushed</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia left the room and walked down the corridor until she heard angry shouting from a nearby conference room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She peered inside to see Matty berating the puppeteers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Group 2 from Zone B, no more betting in the mid-zone. Good luck making money now!" he roared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Spotting Amelia, he lowered his voice and dismissed the others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once they were alone, Matty beckoned her inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hesitantly, she entered and took a seat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matty pulled out a can of sour plums and set it before her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You done here?" he asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before she could respond, he called over James who was passing by.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You done with your tasks?" Matty asked him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James, who understood his intentions, clenched his fists but nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay, there's an issue with your group's invites. You need to head to Paris."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia was wary of Matty, suspecting he knew about James and was manipulating her. However, Matty's words eased her suspicions. If he knew about James, he wouldn't have let him go so easily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matty was always one step ahead. James only caught on when summoned. Given the opportunity, James played the part of a good underling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll head out now," he said, turning to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll see you out," Amelia insisted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James knew she was checking his exit route from Erebus, so he didn't resist and went with her to the elevator.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As James walked away, Matty's eyes darkened, seemingly unhappy with his mild farewell to Amelia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once at the elevator, James went through a series of biometric verifications which he passed smoothly, proving Matty had given him access in advance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When James stepped into the elevator and the doors closed, Amelia's hopes were crushed, like a blown-out candle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tears welled up in her eyes but she held them back, joining him in the elevator.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The ride was silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When they finally reached the residential area surrounded by greenery, Amelia turned to James.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I thought Matty knew who you were, controlled your moves, and used me to pressure you into splitting up."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James knew this was his last chance. He could confirm her suspicions and she would return to him. But he realized Matty could control him anytime, anywhere now that his chip</span><span>'</span><span>s range was expanded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the ticking countdown in his head accelerating, he gently stroked Amelia's hair. "Amelia, I told you, Matty doesn't know who I am. If he did, he wouldn't let me leave," he said sincerely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Staring into his honest eyes, Amelia's hope evaporated. Her heart was heavy, her eyes swollen, and she felt uncomfortable. "I understand, but..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But what? Regardless of the reason, James was leaving her. There was no 'but'.</span></p></div>
