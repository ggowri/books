        <h1>Chapter 1215 counterplot</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jonny raised his hand and gave him a hard slap, "Can you beat him up? Why do we have to kidnap him together? Can't you use your brain?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nick rubbed his forehead and thought seriously, "How about this, you go in and distract James, and we'll take the opportunity to take Amelia away!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jonny's anger subsided, "Remember, wear a hood and disguise yourself as a kidnapper, and take Herb with you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before James led Amelia into the cafe, Andrew whispered beside him, "Sir, there's a suspicious car across the street."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia wanted to turn around and take a look, but James held the back of her head with one hand, "It should be Jonny..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She looked up and asked him, "Could it be that he knows I'm meeting with Herb and is hiding outside to follow me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James held her hand and walked in as if nothing had happened, "His purpose in looking for you is definitely not just to let you see Alice again. Otherwise, with his personality, he wouldn't have the patience to hide in the dark."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Andrew, who was always vigilant, analyzed, "There are several cars following him, and there should be many people with him. It seems that he wants to kidnap Amelia."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James sneered and instructed Andrew, "If Jonny comes in and distracts me later, you protect Amelia and don't let him take her away..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Andrew understood the plan and nodded respectfully, "Okay, leave it to me, no problem..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Herb, who was sitting in the VIP room, saw that Amelia had come in with James and his face suddenly darkened. "Sister, why did you bring him here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Herb saw James, he remembered the incident where he was slapped in the face last time. James wasn't his elder, so why did he have the right to teach him a lesson? He had to find a way to fight back these four slaps, or else he couldn't let go of this grudge!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James glanced at him expressionlessly and sat down opposite him with a powerful aura that suddenly emanated from her. Herb couldn't help but feel scared when he met James&rsquo; gaze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He touched his chest and comforted himself that it was probably because of the psychological shadow left by James&rsquo; slap last time that he felt scared when he saw him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia was much gentler than J. "Herb, I was afraid of danger, so I asked my husband to come with me to see you. Don't mind him too much..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How could Herb not mind? "Sister, next time we meet, just come secretly without bringing him. I get annoyed when I see him..."</span></p></div>
