        <h1>Chapter 1909 I Disagree</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The dean on the other end of the phone took a few seconds to carefully respond, "Mr. Evans, considering Mrs. Evans' health condition, it's almost impossible for a child induced prematurely to survive. Therefore, we plan to perform a cesarean section to try and save the baby. However, Mrs. Evans has undergone several major surgeries, including a heart transplant, and she has poor eyesight. She also suffers from pregnancy-induced hypertension and coagulation dysfunction. Her pregnancy is high-risk. Under these circumstances, the survival rate of a preterm baby delivered by cesarean section is also extremely low. Moreover, performing surgery on a pregnant woman in this condition is very risky. No one can predict what unexpected events might occur during the operation. We fear that in trying to save the child, we might endanger the life of the mother, or even worse, lose both lives..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Dean couldn't make any promises, which was why he proposed a choice of two options. If they chose to have the child, they would use all available medical resources to help the mother carry to term and give birth normally. However, with this method, the mother undoubtedly died after giving birth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Old Mr. Evans also considered that whether it was induced labor or a cesarean section, the child would have a hard time surviving. So, he hoped to keep this from Mr. Evans and let Amelia give birth naturally, then deal with the situation after the child was born. However, as a doctor, she would definitely prioritize the pregnant woman's well-being first.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James called the dean, his main goal was to save both the pregnant woman and the child. But now, hearing the phrase "one body, two lives", he didn't hesitate and said coldly, "No matter what, my wife's life is the priority. Nothing else matters."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From the very beginning, he didn't want a child, he only wanted Amelia. Even though the baby's movements, the baby's features, touched his heartstrings, how could the unborn child compare to Amelia?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After making up his mind, James hung up the phone, put away his mobile, and turned back to the hospital. He pushed open the door of the ward, step by step, walking heavily towards Amelia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia, who was just using Andrew's phone to send a message to Eva, saw James return. She quickly put down the phone and looked at him, "Did something happen with the Evans Group again? Why did it take so long for you to come back?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James fell silent for a moment, pulled up a chair in front of the hospital bed, and slowly sat down. He then extended his slender fingers, taking hold of Amelia's hand, "Amelia, there's something I need to tell you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia gave a slight nod, then took a closer look at James's expression. Seeing his lips pale, she couldn't help but frown, "You look unwell, is it something serious?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man looked into her eyes, those clear and innocent eyes untouched by the world's corruption. He found himself unable to utter the harsh words he had intended to say.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He lifted his other hand, placing it on Amelia's belly. Through the fabric of her clothes, he could feel the presence of their child. With a cold voice, he said, "Amelia, can we not keep this child?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia froze, staring incredulously at the aloof and arrogant man. "What are you talking about? How can you suddenly not want the child that we've struggled so hard to conceive?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every question she asked was like firing a shot straight into James' heart, causing him such distress that he didn't know how to face her, let alone continue the conversation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stared at Amelia, hesitating for a long time before finally saying, "The Dean said that you have sudden onset pregnancy-induced hypertension, accompanied by a coagulation disorder. After evaluation by the hospital's experts, everyone unanimously recommends a cesarean section to deliver the baby."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The cold words seeped into Amelia's ears, leaving her momentarily dazed. It took her a while to come back to her senses, only after James repeatedly squeezed her hands tightly. She slowly asked, "Can the child delivered by cesarean section still survive?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James saw the lost look in her eyes and felt a pang in his heart. He couldn't help but reach out, caressing her face, "The dean can't guarantee your health condition, but she will definitely do her best."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James made an excuse about having something to take care of and was gone for such a long time before he returned. This situation was definitely not as simple as he made it out to be. Amelia tightly gripped James's hand, pleading, "Give me a straight answer, can our baby survive?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James averted his gaze, unable to meet Amelia's eyes. "I'll bring in the best doctor in the world to perform the surgery. I promise we'll save the child's life. You have my word."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They asked for the best surgeon, which meant the child's chances of survival were slim. How could Amelia possibly have accepted this?"I disagree," she said. "My baby has been in my belly for over seven months, always so well-behaved. I can't let him be sacrificed because of me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia, a bit angry, pushed James's hand away, only for him to grab it back immediately. She tried to pull away again, but James tightened his grip, holding her hand firmly in his palm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man gripped her hand tightly, lifting his eyes that were bloodshot. He stared at her tear-streaked face, "Amelia, the issue at hand isn't whether the child can survive, but whether you can!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With her hands restrained, unable to move, Amelia stared blankly at the man whose face was cold and slightly angry. "Preeclampsia, coagulation function, they can all be treated. With proper treatment, can't we wait until it's safe to give birth to the baby?"</span></p></div>
