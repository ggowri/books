        <h1>Chapter 1591 Subtle changes</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Henry didn't suffer any serious after-effects, and he had made a good recovery. He should be able to leave the hospital after some more rest and recuperation. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Stella entered, Henry quickly asked his parents, who were by his bedside, to leave. After glancing at Stella, his parents got up and left. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stella walked over and sat down in front of Henry's bed. "How are you today? Can you move your hand?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Henry nodded and looked at Stella with gentle eyes. "My hand can recover to normal. Don't worry..." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stella held Henry's hand and checked it. Seeing that it had recovered well, she replied, "You can recover, but you probably won't be able to perform surgeries in the future." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Henry didn't mind. "I've been working at the Evans' pharmaceutical company for a while and I've realized that I'm more interested in the field of medicine than performing surgeries." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stella still felt a bit regretful. "You're an excellent surgeon. It's a pity to lose the opportunity to operate." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At these words, a faint smile appeared in Henry's eyes. "Being a doctor, whether it's developing drugs, performing surgeries, or helping patients with rehabilitation, it's all about healing and saving lives. As long as we can save people, there is nothing to regret." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The last sentence fell into Stella's ears, pulling her back to the past as if something had grabbed her, leaving her standing there... </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Erin, who was only eighteen years old, once said the same thing. At that time, he stood with his hands in his pockets, leaning against the escalator, listening quietly to the Simpson family discussing his career direction... </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His grandfather said Erin shouldn't waste his talent and must become a doctor. Thomas, on the other hand, said Erin was the talent needed in the finance industry and must pursue a career in finance. The father and son argued fiercely about this, and in the end, Erin's grandfather couldn't convince Thomas and became very angry. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Erin comforted his grandfather, saying, "No matter what industry I work in, I can heal and save people. As long as we can save people, there is nothing to regret." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was because Erin promised Thomas that he studied finance in college. Thomas then decided to let Erin become the heir and formally enter the Simpson family's business field after graduating from university. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately, before Erin could graduate from college, he committed an unforgivable mistake while still in high school. He violated her and faced the resistance of everyone in the Simpson family, losing his qualification as the heir. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it weren't for that incident, Erin wouldn't have inherited his grandfather's profession and chosen to become a doctor. Instead, he would have become an elite in the finance industry, leading the Simpson family to great success in the business world. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stella comforted herself, saying that Erin's downfall was his own doing and had nothing to do with her. When Henry asked her what was wrong, she gently shook her head, saying, "I'm fine, just tired. Sometimes I space out." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Henry stared at Stella's face, trying to read any signs of change in her expression, but she remained calm as if Erin's death hadn't affected her at all. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After contemplating Stella for a moment, Henry asked, "Stella, I told you before that once we sent Erin to prison, we could be together again. Now that he's dead, there's no longer any obstacle between us. Can we start over?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Henry hadn't forced Stella, but he believed that Erin was the one standing in their way of being together. He wanted to send Erin to prison first, to protect Stella from harm and to be able to restart their relationship. However, he never expected things to escalate to the point of someone's death. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Henry felt that it was inappropriate to ask about getting back together at this time, but his selfishness made him blurt it out. He had a feeling that something was quietly changing after Erin's death, but he couldn't quite grasp it...</span></p></div>
