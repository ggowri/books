        <h1>Chapter 1870 The final trump card</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at the chaotic crowd in the passage, James slowly stopped in his tracks. "Holden, it's up to you now." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Holden immediately waved his hand and led his members to quickly catch up. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The black-clad men who stayed behind to cover their retreat ran and fired their guns backwards. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Holden shouted loudly. "We only kill the </span><span>manipulators,</span><span> we won't kill anyone else who works for Erebus. Clear? Move aside!" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a life-or-death situation, everyone chooses to protect their own lives, especially the black-clad men who were only working for Erebus. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When the black-clad men saw Holden pass by them and head straight for the manipulators at the front, they slowly stopped shooting. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing the black-clad men switch sides, Lewis, who couldn't run anymore, suddenly stopped and turned around to confront the members of S.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lewis drew his gun and aimed directly at Holden's forehead, but his speed was no match for Holden's. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His massive body fell to the ground, and the other nine manipulators, seeing Lewis dead, also stopped running. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Everyone, open fire!" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The manipulators of Erebus were also well-trained. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as Lewis died, 1-7 took command. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Following 1-7's orders, the nine manipulators raised their guns and opened fire on the members of S. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the moment Lewis fell, they were already prepared to die together, but Holden had no intention of dying with them. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Save yourselves, kill them!" With Holden's command, the members of S also went crazy, aiming at their opponents and firing desperately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The intense battle between the two sides lasted for about five minutes before all nine manipulators were finally defeated. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After they fell, James walked over the bodies of the fallen manipulators. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>10 down. 39 more to go. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James looked towards the escape passage that led to Zone B. "Let's go to Zone B--" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The monitoring of the escape passage in Zone A was not destroyed, so the manipulators in Zone B could naturally monitor the situation here. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing that James and his group were coming to Zone B, the manipulators prepared themselves for the worst. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Be ready, as soon as they enter the blast range, detonate!" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>1-8, the main person in charge of Zone B, planned to blow up all the members of S in the escape passage. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, James suddenly looked up. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With his eyes filled with killing intent, he looked at the monitor, and the screen instantly went blank. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the blink of an eye, all the monitors were shut off!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After cursing in anger, 1-8 gave the order again. "Detonate, block their path!" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately, just as they were about to detonate, James and his group had already returned along the same route. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, 1-8 saw James' figure appear on the monitor at the entrance of Zone B.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unlike Lewis' determination to die together, 1-8 clearly valued his own life more. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before the battle even began, he sought help from Matty. "Boss, Zone A has fallen, and James has also reached Zone B. What should we do now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matty, who could see all the monitors, was well aware that Zone A had fallen, but he chose not to say anything. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clearly, in the current situation, even if the manipulators in Zones B and C were to die together with the members of S, it would only buy them some time. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To minimize casualties, there were only two options: either break through the enemy's hackers and </span><span>blow up</span><span> James' head, or reveal their trump card and negotiate. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the first option would clearly result in a prolonged stalemate. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matty no longer had time to waste on the detonation program. He could only... </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although he had previously claimed to use Amelia as the final trump card to silence all the manipulators, Matty didn't actually have that intention. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now... </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unable to watch himself be defeated, Matty left with a final remark of "Hold on, I'll be right back," and quickly headed to the escape room below the biochemistry area. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, James adopted a different approach. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He commanded Holden and Emelyn to enter Zones B and C respectively, while he himself headed to the biochemistry area. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because he knew that there was an escape room in the biochemistry area that no one could break into. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he were Matty, he would definitely place his </span><span>final trump card</span><span> there. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That's why, after James entered, he didn't immediately go to find Amelia.</span></p></div>
