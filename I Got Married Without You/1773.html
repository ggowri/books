        <h1>Chapter 1773 A temporary truce</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though there are still a lot of uncertainties about James, 1-2 still made an exception to give him the status of an invitee. Even though he is controlled by a chip and handed over the controller to Mr. Ben, 1-2 still values him a lot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When all this was happening, Carson was not in Erebus. At that time, he was reported by Emily because the authority to pick up and drop off invitees was with him. Emily wanted to take away his authority and take away the people he was leading. 1-2 told him to endure it for the sake of the S member list, and once Emily and her group spit out all the names, 1-2 would get rid of them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emily and Mr. Ben are pretty smart too. They only reveal one or two names each time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When James first came, Carson was punished by 1-2 and transferred to Zone C after being reported by Emily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Erebus is not just one </span><span>area,</span><span> it is divided into three major zones: ABC. Each major zone is further divided into three zones: upper, middle, and lower. The permissions for these three zones are all locked down, with one layer of monitoring after another. Nobody can walk around freely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their rules are simple. The invitees in the middle zone watch the life-and-death duels of the players in the lower zone, while the people behind the scenes in the upper zone are concerned with the fairness of the betting by the invitees in the middle zone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Biochemical Zone is an area outside of the ABC zones, specifically targeting S members, and is managed by 1-3. 1-1 is responsible for the programming and chip development for all zones, and 1-2 is responsible for management and game programming.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>1-1 and 1-3 don't come often, so 1-2 is the one in control most of the time. Now that James has cracked 1-1's permissions, 1-2 will definitely have to consult 1-1, and when he does, who knows what means he will use to deal with James.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If only they had known that James would act so impulsively for </span><span>Sumasa's</span><span> daughter, they should have told him directly about the double protection, and neither of them would have ended up locked in a closed area now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that time, Carson didn't trust James, after all, their families were enemies. If it weren't for him finding out that James was tampering with the monitoring of the player rooms for </span><span>Sumasa's</span><span> daughter, Carson would never have had any contact with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After thinking about it, Carson knocked on the wall again: "Is Amelia your secret wife?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Touching the bite marks on his teeth, James moved his fingers away and put them on the wall: "Yes."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Venom had vaguely guessed it before, and now that he got the accurate answer, he felt a bit depressed: "I didn't expect our two big enemies to be married."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James had no expression on his face: "</span><span>Sumasa</span><span> is not from the Clark family, and Amelia is not from the Clark family either."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since Amelia is James's secret wife, he naturally knows the other's background.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carson didn't care about this, but he felt guilty about </span><span>Sumasa</span><span>. He lowered his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Although </span><span>Sumasa</span><span> is not from the Clark family, she has always been like a sister to me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sumasa</span><span> has always been the sister who loved him the most since he was young.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But because he believed his older sister's words, he spoke coldly to </span><span>Sumasa</span><span>, and even ignored her. He only found out later that she had starved to death on the street.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In Carson's eyes, the youthful beauty of </span><span>Sumasa</span><span> and the first time he saw Amelia's face on the monitor were the same. After the two faces overlapped, he raised his hand again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I will treat Amelia as my niece in the future, so for her sake, the Clark family and the Evans Family will temporarily cease hostilities and no longer seek revenge or kill each other."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James responded to Carson's promise with indifference, and the two fell silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James leaned against the wall, touching the bite marks above his collarbone, lost in thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It's not clear how long had passed when the door to James's confinement suddenly opened, and a beam of white light shone in, hitting James's cold, snow-like face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After being in the dark for so long, suddenly encountering light is always uncomfortable. He subconsciously turned his head slightly to avoid the dazzling light, then raised his cold eyes and looked at the person who walked in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>1-2, who was not wearing protective gear and was wearing a full-face mask, walked in with steady steps, followed by Emily, Mr. Ben, and a group of black-clad people who had previously subdued James.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After this group of people came in, they coldly stared at the man who should have been in a sorry state but still maintained his former elegance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After 1-2 came in, he didn't say anything, just paced back and forth with his hands behind his back, probably hesitating on how to deal with James. Once he made up his mind, he raised his hand and gestured to the black-clad people.</span></p></div>
