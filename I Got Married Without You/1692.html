        <h1>Chapter 1672 Everyone's got a bond</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia didn't respond, so Herb touched his greasy, shiny pompadour and strutted past both of them into the wedding hall. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beside him, Zack nervously led Gigi to James and said, "Mr. Evans, my wife's family is a bit strange." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before James could react, Gigi slapped Zack on the head and said, "Who are you calling strange?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zack held his head and looked at James with a pitiful look that seemed to say, "Sir, do you think they're normal?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James averted his gaze, pretending not to see, and Zack knew what he meant. He had chosen his path, and he would have to bear it. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zack's face gloomy, Gigi dragged him into the wedding hall, saying, "Wow, this place is so beautiful, Zack. I want a wedding like this, no, I want a wedding even more beautiful than this..." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite being slapped, Zack still fulfilled all of Gigi's demands, saying, "Okay, whatever kind of wedding you want, I'll make it for you, as long as you're happy..." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gigi hugged Zack's arm, smiling with great happiness, saying, "I knew you would be the best to me." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As James watched Zack and Gigi walk away, his cold expression gradually softened. Zack had found his place, Andrew took his wife back to the Simpson family, and Paul got married too. The important people in his life had their own bonds, and he could finally let go, but... </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James raised his long, powerful hand and touched Amelia's hair. He wondered if the assets he left behind were enough, if his 30% stake was sufficient, and if he had made the right arrangements for Peter to protect her. He also wondered if her brothers would keep their promises and take care of her... </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia sensed that something was off with James and hugged his waist, nestling into his embrace, saying, "Honey, Johnny and Herb are just trying to provoke you. Don't let it bother you." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James didn't say anything in response. He moved his hand down and gently patted her back, saying, "I'm a bit possessive." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After he left, if Johnny and Herb dared to have any intentions towards his wife, he would come back and teach them a lesson! </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia couldn't help but laugh when she heard him call himself possessive. "You jealous husband, the wedding is about to start, let's go inside..." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James not only didn't mind Amelia calling him possessive, but he also indulged her. He embraced her, kissed her, and then let go, intertwining their fingers as they walked into the wedding hall. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inside, the carpet was covered in red roses, leading all the way to the wedding stage, which was adorned with numerous flowers. The atmosphere was fresh and full of romance. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Above the hall, crystal chandeliers in the shape of wind chimes hung, emitting a sparkling glow. The sound of the wind occasionally created a pleasant tinkling sound as it passed through the windows. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone who saw this elegant and romantic wedding venue couldn't help but exclaim how beautiful it was. Paul not only put effort into it but also used computer technology to create two AI models. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One was Eva, labeled as number 33, and the other was Paul, labeled as number 77. These two humanoid AIs stood inside the wedding hall, welcoming each guest that entered... </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Eva didn't like these two AIs, to be precise, she found them so ugly that she couldn't bear to look at them. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul, on the other hand, thought his creativity was excellent and insisted that Eva hug them. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wearing a wedding dress and delicate makeup, Eva reluctantly hugged each of them, thinking about her own wedding day.</span></p></div>
