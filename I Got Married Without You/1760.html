        <h1>Chapter 1760 James came</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia didn't realize it was her turn to face death until the mechanical voice sounded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She forced a stiff smile, clutching the apple </span><span>Johnny</span><span> had left for her, and walked out of the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alone in the hallway, she wished someone would come out, smile, and say, "What a coincidence, I'm still alive too." But no one did.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Following the mechanical voice's instructions, she arrived at the ninth round of the casino. This room was completely different from before, no longer all white, but dazzling with gold and jewels.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The opulent room symbolized the identity of Erebus' mastermind. The more luxurious </span><span>the room, the </span><span>more lowly</span><span> the people who entered it, to meet their demise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Filled with anger, Amelia approached the control panel and randomly selected an option. She didn't even bother to listen to the rules, just chose without fear, knowing that whatever she picked, it would lead to her death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If she lost, she planned to ask the man in black if James was now working for Erebus. If she won, she would continue to challenge the games in other areas until she found James. At this point, she no longer cared about her own life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With this despair, she pressed a button, and the door in front of her slowly opened, indicating she had chosen correctly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She felt fate was playing a cruel joke on her. In the eighth round, she needed to choose correctly but didn't, and now, when she wanted to lose, she chose right.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Player 2-7, codenamed Cross, congratulations, you have successfully completed all the levels. You can choose to leave and receive a substantial prize from Erebus, or stay and continue to challenge games in other areas. If you choose to leave, enter the door, and Erebus will escort you home. If you choose to stay, press the confirmation button on the control panel, and Erebus will open a direct passage to other areas."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia listened and sneered, then without hesitation, pressed the confirmation button&mdash;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't press it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A clear, magnetic voice came from behind her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia's pale, slender fingers suddenly froze in mid-air. Despite the passage of time, she would always remember his voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She stood still, listening to the steady footsteps approaching her. She didn't dare to look up, but slowly raised her eyelashes to see the man standing in front of her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wore a mask, so she couldn't see his face, but his proportions and the cold aura emanating from him confirmed that he was James, the man who promised to come home in a month but never did.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia gazed at </span><span>him,</span><span> her pale face unable to muster a smile. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wanted to smile and throw herself into his arms, telling him, "Honey, I finally found you," or coquettishly saying, "Honey, do you know? I'm pregnant with our baby."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But at that moment, Amelia couldn't say anything. She just reached out to remove his mask.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wanted to take off the mask, but he grabbed her wrist and shook his head, preventing her from doing so. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This action made Amelia angry, and she disregarded his resistance, taking off his mask.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His chiseled face, deep and profound features, vast blue eyes like the starry sky, and the golden hair combed back were etched in Amelia's heart. Even if she had amnesia, she would still recognize him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tears uncontrollably streamed down her face. Looking at her, he too became teary-eyed. They gazed at each other, as if it had been a thousand years since they last met.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia raised her trembling hand and touched his face. She wanted to say, "Honey, I </span><span>missed you so much," but it came out as a question.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She heard herself ask him, somewhat angrily, in a cold voice. "James, why don't you go home?"</span></p></div>
