        <h1>Chapter 1846: Watch Out for Your Child</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emily was left speechless after hearing what was being said. She felt like it was her parents' sins that were being repaid.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite having everything in life, she could never have the man she loved. Worse yet, Amelia, the one her father abandoned, had him. Was this her karma?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But all these sins were committed by my parents, I was just a kid! Why should I pay for their mistakes?" Emily retorted, feeling wronged.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Because," Amelia pinched Emily's cheek, "you're just as wicked as them, if not more."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emily, who had hurt Simon, the man who loved her, was indeed wicked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Amelia finished speaking, she let go of Emily's face, only for Emily to attempt a punch at her stomach, but was stopped by a swift bodyguard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Amelia, be glad. If it weren't for me luring you to Erebus with James, you wouldn't have found your family. You wouldn't be here, shouting at me!" Emily fumed, her face turning red.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you, Emily. If it weren't for your revenge plot, I wouldn't be sitting here, watching your true colors." Amelia nodded knowingly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Emily was about to retort, the bodyguard slapped her across the face, "Watch your mouth in front of my lady, or I'll feed you to the snakes!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emily was green with envy at the thought of Amelia not only winning James' love but also becoming an influential member of the Lawrence Family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia had said what she wanted to say. Now it was time for her to exact her revenge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bind her up and throw her into the sea. Let her taste the fear of drowning." Amelia commanded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matty walked in and suggested, "Let's not let her off that easy. Throw her into the lower district first, let her experience the game of life and death. Then throw her into the sea."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emily believed that Matty would keep his word for the list of S members she had. So, she stayed silent, planning her revenge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matty then turned to Amelia, "Let's go and watch this in the control room."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The bodyguard unchained Emily, dragging her out like livestock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Watch out for your karma, Amelia. It might affect your bastard!" Emily cursed as she was being dragged out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Emily, if you call James' child a bastard, then you never really loved him. Stop using that as an excuse to express your wickedness!" Amelia shot back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emily didn't respond, instead, she just laughed eerily. This frightened Amelia's unborn child, causing it to kick about.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry, baby. It's just a mean lady trying to scare you. Mommy will take care of it, don't be scared." Amelia gently comforted her bump.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matty seeing that Amelia was affected, quickly comforted her, "Your baby is telling you to get rid of Emily. She's a threat to others. Let's go and do what's right."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Matty helped Amelia up and they went to the control room. His eagerness was not only to avenge the </span><span>Sumasa</span><span> but also to eliminate the </span><span>Moores</span><span> who knew the truth.</span></p></div>
