        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, Matty had adjusted his emotions and picked up the report again, handing it to Dylan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Take this report and bring Amelia back home. After she returns, change her name to Amelia Lawrence. Also, bring my daughter </span><span>Sumasa's</span><span> ashes back from the Clark family."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After making these arrangements, Matty instructed Dylan, "I just found out that Skender's child is buried at the Sherwood family. Bring her ashes back and change her name as well."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After receiving the report, Dylan looked down at it and then back at Matty. "Grandfather, the way we treated James, Amelia probably won't want to come home with me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matty raised his hand, loosened his tie, and leaned back in his leather chair. "Don't tell Amelia about Erebus. If she knew we had hurt James, she wouldn't willingly return to the Lawrence family."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What about James?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matty's eyes showed a moment of hesitation, but it quickly vanished, and he made a decisive decision. "Don't tell James that Amelia is alive. Also, have someone watch over Carson and prevent him from obtaining permission to enter the biozone. Let the doctors treat James, but never let him leave the biozone."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James was Amelia's husband and the leader of S, so they wouldn&rsquo;t kill him, </span><span>and</span><span> keeping him alive would help Matty get information about S's mastermind. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for Emily, they would keep her alive for now, as her existence was the reason James was still alive. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As long as the hatred remains, James would continue to live. Matty's decision seemed somewhat cruel to Dylan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Grandfather, Amelia is pregnant and went to Erebus to find James, showing how much she loves him. Is it too cruel to separate them like this?" Dylan asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matty's eyes darkened. "I watched the video. James has divorced Amelia, and she said she would never see him again. </span><span>Let them never meet again</span><span>."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matty had always been stubborn and set in his ways, unwilling to consider things </span><span>from others' perspectives. Dylan couldn't persuade him and didn't dare to try. As Dylan was about to leave, Matty called him back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bring Carson here. I need to ask him how </span><span>Sumasa</span><span> ended up at his house."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matty had previously asked Carson about </span><span>Sumasa</span><span>, but Carson claimed not to know anything. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matty suspected that Carson didn't want to reveal family secrets and was being evasive. Matty wanted to question Carson further to find out more about </span><span>Sumasa's</span><span> past.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Dylan left, Matty's frosty expression faded, and he retrieved a photo of Sophia, gazing at the woman with a smile that could charm a hundred men, his eyes moistening.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sophia, I lost. I lost to your relentless cruelty."</span></p></div>
