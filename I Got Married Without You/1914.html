        <h1>Chapter 1914 James compromised</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tall and imposing, James had changed out of his surgical gown and into a black suit.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked like a messenger from hell, cold and pale, with a hidden anger in his eyes that he couldn't suppress.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He walked over to the passenger seat, peering down at the woman inside through the tinted windows. "Are you going to get out on your own, or do I have to smash his car and carry you out?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia looked out the window, feeling the overwhelming rage emanating from the man.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She slowly lowered her eyelashes and then raised her hand to open the car door.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before she could step out, her wrist was grabbed by his icy fingers.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If she wasn't pregnant, she might have been forcefully pulled out of the car by now.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He held onto her wrist and helped her out of the car.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, he lowered his cold, menacing gaze and glanced at Johnny, who was furrowing his brows.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that moment, Johnny saw the murderous intent in James' eyes, but it quickly disappeared. He took Amelia's hand and walked towards the Bugatti.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suppressing his anger, James opened the passenger door and waited for her to get in. He then bent down, took off her seatbelt, and fastened it for her.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at James, whose jaw was tightly clenched in anger, Amelia opened her lips to speak, but before she could say anything, he straightened up, closed the car door, walked around the front of the car, and got into the driver's seat.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once he was inside, he didn't even glance at Amelia and started the car.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They drove away from the road, probably to take care of her, as the speed was slow and aimless.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Watching James, who seemed to have no idea where he was driving, Amelia slowly spoke up, "Honey, when I was lying on the operating table, the baby moved vigorously, as if resisting. I really couldn't bear it, that's why..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She saw that James still hadn't looked at her, so she didn't explain further.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She just lowered her head and whispered, "I'm sorry, I didn't want to have a abortion, so..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you didn't want the surgery, why did you run away with him?" James interrupted Amelia's words in a fit of rage.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia froze, staring at the man who had stopped the car by the side of the road. He approached her with his eyes burning crimson.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Amelia, if it were before, I would have crushed the hand that held yours when you were with Johnny!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia's heart trembled. Perhaps because James had been too gentle to her since they got together, she had forgotten that James was originally a fierce and ruthless person.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She knew not to provoke him when he was angry, so she lowered her head and remained silent.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Prolonged silence could hurt each other even more.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James, who had been silent for a long time, lowered his proud head and pressed his forehead against Amelia's.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Never mind, why am I getting angry with you?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She only had a 30% chance of survival, and she could leave him at any time.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In this situation, he was still getting angry at her. It was really childish.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia raised her eyelashes, her long lashes brushing against his, and the distance between them was so close that their breaths mingled.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was because she could feel his gentleness that she dared to speak.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm sorry, I was afraid you would insist on me having a abortion, that's why I didn't tell you. As for Johnny... I just happened to run into him."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In this relationship, as long as Amelia spoke gently, James would lose his temper. Being deeply in love with her, he slightly raised his chin and kissed her cheek before releasing her slowly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you really that unwilling to let go of the baby?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia grabbed James' hand and placed it on her belly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The baby inside was still moving. It was a life that already existed. How could she bear to let go?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Whether I have a abortion or not, my chances of survival are slim, but the baby has a chance. As long as we wait a little longer for him to develop more, he will definitely survive. So, let's bet on that 10% chance."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As James felt the presence of the baby through Amelia's belly, his eyes, filled with hostility, gradually softened.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't because of the baby, it was because of Amelia.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, since you're willing to bet on that 10% chance, I'll accompany you."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, his chip could explode at any time, and he didn't know how long he would live.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her chances of survival were also very slim, so if she died, he would die with her.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia didn't expect James to suddenly compromise, but she could guess that he had made a decision. She couldn't help but reach out and touch his face.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"James, if we lose the 10% chance, you're not allowed to follow me. You have to live well and take care of our child until they grow up. Only then will I wait for you in heaven. Otherwise, you won't find me."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James smirked and laughed coldly, "You can abandon me for the sake of the child, so you might as well be more heartless and not care about whether I live or die."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was still sulking, and Amelia could tell, but she didn't argue with him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She just reached out and hugged James tightly. "You and the child are equally important to me. That's why I want both of you to be well."</span></p></div>
