        <h1>Chapter 1639 A jinx who caused harm</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kate couldn't understand Eva, and Eva had no intention of persuading Kate. She just tried to see things from Kate's perspective and acknowledge her point of view.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mrs. Evans, if I were you, facing a woman who is nothing compared to your own son, I would be just as dissatisfied as you are. I understand you, but please also think about Paul. It was his idea to marry me, not mine to marry him. If you want me to back off, it's better to talk to him. If he is convinced and no longer wants to marry me, just let me know, and I won't bother him anymore, even avoiding him in the future&hellip;"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva said all this in one breath, her heart pounding. This was her first time standing firm against someone for Paul, even though she knew she was not as good as him or deserving of him. But because he loved her and she couldn't let go of him, she was determined to fight for their relationship.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kate scrutinized Eva and after a while, she suddenly smiled. "You just said you don't love my son, and now you're saying you don't have to marry him. It seems that you don't care much about my son. If that's the case, why would you insist on marrying him just because of his passion?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kate's question was quite profound, and Eva found it difficult to express herself and lowered her head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing her reaction, Kate continued, "Setting aside your personal background, academic abilities, and all that, just this point alone, I think every mother would want their future daughter-in-law to wholeheartedly love their son. If you can't even do that, what makes you think I can convince my son?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing this, Eva's lowered eyelashes trembled slightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it weren't for the one-night stand, she probably wouldn't have considered marriage again. But after the one-night stand and hearing Paul say he must marry her, she couldn't help but waver in her determination. However, the root of her wavering was not just Paul's words of wanting to marry her. It was her realization that deep down, she hadn't let go of Paul yet, which made her want to take another risk.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, in terms of deep love, it couldn't compare to Amelia and James. At least in Eva's eyes, her relationship with Paul was fragile. Paul was used to being fickle; she didn't know if he would continue to love her in the future.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva had no sense of security about this, so she dared only say she liked Paul, not that she loved him. She wanted to control her feelings, so as not to completely collapse or go crazy if she was betrayed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't want to become a hysterical woman or an abandoned wife. She could only remain calm by restraining her emotions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But obviously, these words were something Kate couldn't understand. Kate was born into a wealthy family, had a comfortable life since childhood, and even had a husband who loved her wholeheartedly. She naturally couldn't empathize.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva didn't want to speak ill of her son in front of Kate either.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva's silence made Kate feel even more sorry for Paul. "Ms. Miller, I'm speaking here. I've always been direct. Besides what I mentioned before, there's another thing that really bothers me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva slowly raised her head and asked Kate in confusion, "Did I do something wrong to you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kate shook her head, but there was a hint of anger in her indifferent eyes. "Before, my son got into an accident because of you, crashing into Johnny's car. It was the first time I saw him injured. After managing to save him and sending him to the hospital, he was provoked by your ex-boyfriend and needed rescue again. Do you know how angry I was when I received that rescue call in the middle of the night? My perfectly fine son, getting injured for you once was bad enough, but you actually allowed your ex-boyfriend to make him suffer a second time. Seeing him lying helpless in the hospital bed, it broke my heart."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In Kate's eyes, Eva was a jinx who caused harm. However, at that time, she had no right to say anything to Eva and could only let Paul do as he pleased. But now that the matter of marriage was brought up and it reached her, she had to intervene. At the very least, she wanted to make these things clear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anthony, at least, loved Edith wholeheartedly and was willing to give everything for her. But what about you? You don't love my son, and you don't cherish him. How can I, as his mother, feel at ease letting him marry you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva felt guilty about Paul being provoked to the point of needing rescue. She deeply regretted it and lowered her head. "I'm sorry. I misjudged people and caused trouble for him, making him suffer and get hurt..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In this matter, Eva didn't try to defend herself. It was only natural for a mother to be heartbroken for her son in such a situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She also agreed with Kate's words. She hadn't really cherished Paul before and always thought of their relationship as a casual fling that would eventually end. She forced herself not to care about him, but people you don't care about are easy to neglect...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, when Paul talked to her, he was indifferent and didn't take her seriously. Even when they broke up, it was just a simple "okay," quickly ending their relationship that could be considered insignificant. Who could have known that after the breakup, he would become entangled and even insist on marrying her...</span></p></div>
