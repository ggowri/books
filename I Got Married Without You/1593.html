        <h1>Chapter 1593 Thanks for being decisive</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Stella finished speaking, she didn't wait for Henry to respond. She got up and left directly, just as decisive as when she fired at Erin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stella was never a person who hesitated or wavered. When she made a decision, she would tell the other person directly and then cut off all ties. But Henry knew that Stella wouldn't cut him off like that. At least until his hand fully recovered, she would still care for him as she always had. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To Stella, he was still an important person in her heart, just not as important as a lover. But the weight of his presence wouldn't diminish to the point of being strangers. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Henry knew too well what kind of person Stella was. He looked at her back and slowly spoke, "Stella, if I hadn't gone to find you, would you have gotten along well with Erin on the island for a month?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stella's footsteps slowly paused, but she didn't turn around. After standing in place for a few seconds, she continued on her way. No one knew the answer in Stella's heart, but Henry could see it. If he hadn't gone, Stella would have gotten along with Erin for a month and then returned safely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Henry lay back on the pillow of the hospital bed, looking at that figure standing in front of his parents, his expression gradually turning pale... Did he indirectly cause Erin's death?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After greeting Henry's parents and reminding Henry not to get wet, Stella planned to leave, but she was stopped by Henry's parents.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stella, we heard what you just said to Henry," Henry's mother said with a gentle face, with a few uncertain emotions flickering, but ultimately firming up. She smiled and thanked Stella, "Thank you for being decisive."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They couldn't afford any more trouble. They hoped their son could have a peaceful life in the future and not go through such dramatic events again. Stella was also a good woman, but Henry's mother felt that Stella, who had loved someone so deeply and even shot and killed her beloved, would never be able to get past this hurdle in her life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stella would always carry an indelible mark in her heart, which couldn't bring Henry a stable life. Even if he didn't mind, as time went on, if Stella never fell in love with him, he would inevitably feel a bit resentful. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If this resentment grew, wouldn't Henry start to have grievances against Stella? And once grievances arose, how could the two of them live peacefully together?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Henry's mother didn't want her son to blame Stella in the future, argue with her, and then abandon her. In the end, the one who would suffer would still be Stella.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A woman understood another woman most. What Henry's mother worried about was exactly what Stella was thinking. Stella smiled and said, "This is what I should do, and also..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stella sincerely bowed to the two elderly people. "I'm sorry."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I'm sorry for causing your son to get hurt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I'm sorry for heartlessly rejecting your son.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I'm sorry I can't be your daughter-in-law...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Henry's mother approached and helped Stella up, then gave her a hug. After hugging her, Stella let go and waved goodbye to the two elderly people, stepping away in her high heels and leaving the hospital ward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When she returned to the outpatient department and was about to ask which department needed help, someone tapped her shoulder from behind. Stella turned around and saw a man in a blue suit. He looked familiar, but she couldn't remember. "Who are you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man smiled with a clear smile and said to Stella, "Stella, I'm Mason. Don't you remember me?"</span></p></div>
