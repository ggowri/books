        <h1>Chapter 1806 I was right to hit you</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia instinctively covered her red and painful face, which had been scalded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva rushed over and hugged Amelia, protecting her in her arms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul quickly pushed away the porridge in Gigi's hand, while Johnny grabbed Gigi's wrist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What are you doing?" Johnny furrowed his brow and glared at Gigi. "Zack sacrificed himself for James willingly, it wasn't James forcing him. It was his own choice. And if you want to blame someone, blame James. Why are you splashing porridge on Amelia?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gigi, who had lost her composure, completely ignored Johnny's words and pushed him away like a madwoman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Johnny, who was still recovering from his gunshot wound, was almost knocked out by the pain when she pushed him and strained his wound.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Johnny had to steady himself by holding onto the table, and the pain from his wound left him speechless for a moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Zack died because of her husband, shouldn't she have to endure this?" Gigi, who was in a fit of madness, couldn't distinguish right from wrong.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's all because of her husband that Zack died!" She stared at Amelia, tears streaming down her face, and struggled to control her urge to hit someone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She knew she was wrong, but recently she didn't know what was wrong with her, always losing her temper and hitting people.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one owed her anything in this world, and she shouldn't have to endure her own abnormal behavior, but what could she do?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zack was dead, she was sick, what was she supposed to do?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gigi couldn't figure it out, and couldn't control herself. She picked up the soup bowl from the table and was about to continue splashing it on Amelia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luckily, Paul was there. Unlike Johnny's mercy, he was much more ruthless, grabbing Gigi by the neck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a cold face, he firmly restrained Gigi and then turned to look at Amelia, who was covering her eyes and couldn't open them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Eva, go call the doctor!" Eva snapped out of her daze and quickly pressed the call button for the doctor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Paul was trying to drag Gigi out, but she suddenly calmed down, tears streaming down her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing her like this, Paul furrowed his brow, then let go of her and stood by, keeping a close eye on her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ignoring his own injury, Johnny walked up to Amelia, feeling a bit helpless, and asked if she was in pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia was in so much pain that she couldn't speak, so Johnny stopped asking and just looked at her with concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The doctor quickly came in, cleaned the soup from Amelia's eyes, and she finally opened her eyes, which were in unbearable pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her vision was a bit blurry, but she could still see clearly. However, her face was red and swollen from the hot soup.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The doctor said the temperature of the chicken soup was so high that it had burned off a layer of her skin, and told them not to fight in the hospital room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After treating the burn, the doctor left some ointment and instructed Eva to apply it to Amelia, then quickly left the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After the doctor left, Gigi curled up in a corner, staring blankly at Amelia's red face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's because of your husband that Zack died, so it's not wrong for me to hit you..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Through her hazy and scattered eyes, Amelia looked at the lonely Gigi.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Gigi, I'm sorry. I don't think James did it on purpose either. He probably didn't expect Zack to do that."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She believed in James' character. If he could, he would rather it be him in the snake pit than sacrificing Zack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Gigi didn&rsquo;t understand, and she didn&rsquo;t see it clearly. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In her view, it was James who made Zack sacrifice himself. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He is Zack's boss. Whatever he tells Zack to do, Zack has to do it..." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's not like that. In that situation, he really didn't have time..." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He didn't have time to find another scapegoat?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia choked up, and Johnny, who was next to her, wanted to explain, but he was </span><span>interrupted by Gigi's mocking laughter.</span></p></div>
