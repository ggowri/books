        <h1>Chapter 1196 Amelia, you are really lucky to have escaped (1)</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>J</span><span>ames</span><span> didn't want to talk about it, and A</span><span>melia</span><span> didn't ask any further. She took the coat handed to her by the servant and helped him put it on. She then considerately tied his tie for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When they were living in No.8 Mansion, A</span><span>melia</span><span> used to help him put on his suit jacket and tie before he left, just like a wife would. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that time, J</span><span>ames</span><span> would fantasize about how great it would be if she were his wife. However, he suppressed the urge to stay and constantly warned himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The person she loved was only R</span><span>yan</span><span>, and he was afraid of G</span><span>loria</span><span> finding out and couldn't marry her. Their relationship was destined to be a short-lived marriage where they had each other for a brief moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Who would have thought that his unwillingness to give up would eventually make her his wife? Now, everything she does is so beautiful and heartwarming.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After finishing adjusting his shirt collar, A</span><span>melia</span><span> looked up and smiled at him, "Go quickly, I'll be waiting for you at home."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>J</span><span>ames</span><span> didn't want her to know about his dirty past, but yesterday he only went to the company and D</span><span>ominic</span><span> hurt her, leaving her alone at home. He was worried, so he grabbed her hand and said to her, "Come with me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Compared to the ugly and bloody past, A</span><span>melia</span><span>'s safety was much more important.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A</span><span>melia</span><span> didn't refuse when he wanted to take her with him. She nodded and put her hand in his palm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She followed J</span><span>ames</span><span> to the prison.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>J</span><span>ames</span><span> didn't let her wait in the car, but took her directly to see G</span><span>loria</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When she saw G</span><span>loria</span><span> through the thick glass for the first time, A</span><span>melia</span><span> was stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had never </span><span>seen</span><span> G</span><span>loria in person</span><span>, only seen </span><span>her</span><span> in the news.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The former chairman and head of the Leinster family is sitting in a wheelchair, holding a book in her hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her surroundings are pleasant, with green trees shading the area. Sunlight filters through the branches, casting dappled shadows on her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her face was not masked or covered in any way, but rather burned and twisted with lines resembling the shape of insects, covering her skin densely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even in the sunlight, her appearance was still enough to make one's heart skip a beat...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As if sensing someone looking at her from outside, Gloria's gaze moved away from the book and slowly raised.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When she saw James standing outside the door with his hands in his pockets, her eyes were suddenly filled with hatred.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While Amelia may feel empathy for the burned skin on her face, it was impossible to ignore the deep-seated sinfulness in her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her eyes are like those of a murderer hiding in the corner...</span></p></div>
