        <h1>Chapter 1919 Complications were triggered</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James stared at the woman lying on the operating table with a pair of dark red eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had reminded her to remember to come back home, and she had listened to him, cooperating with the doctors, and came back from hell...</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia, you are truly strong, and thank you. Remember to come back.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James had never been so grateful, nor had he ever been so afraid, but luckily, she had fought through it with determination.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James's hands were propped on the ground, his palms covered in blood that had spilled onto the floor.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he looked at the blood, the fear still controlled his body, rendering him unable to even stand up...</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't until a baby's cry echoed in the operating room that James lifted his eyelashes and looked at the baby in Hugh's hands.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The tiny body, no bigger than a palm, had also fought through with the same strength as its mother...</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Listening to the baby's cries and the sound of the heartbeat coming from the electrocardiogram, James felt the greatness of life for the first time.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sourness in his eyes welled up, causing him pain.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Placing the baby in an incubator did not guarantee its survival, it only meant that it was alive for now and still required the doctors' utmost efforts for further treatment.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dominic tried to step forward, but as he passed James, the man's cold hand grabbed his ankle...</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dominic lowered his head and met the bloodthirsty eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before he could react, James flipped him over and rained down punches on him like a torrential downpour...</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James swung his fists like a madman, pouring all his strength into each punch, relentlessly pounding Dominic.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, fresh red blood began to trickle from Dominic's mouth...</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The people Dominic had brought wanted to rush forward and save him from James's grip, but they heard the man's bone-chilling rebuke:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Whoever dares to save him, I'll make sure you never see the sun tomorrow!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dominic, who heard these words, never expected James to have such a strong desire for revenge.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he didn't regret it. If it weren't for him telling Hugh to save the child first, the child wouldn't have survived!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"James, you bastard!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The biggest bastard in this world is you!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If James had a gun in his hand right now, he would have shot him dead instead of using his fists to vent the raging fire in his chest!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dominic didn't last long before James knocked him unconscious with his fists. However, James had no intention of letting him off; he continued to pummel him mercilessly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul had initially wanted to save Dominic, but Eva grabbed his hand and stopped him. "Don't go. You, as a grandfather, have no humanity. It's better if he dies!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva glared at Dominic, filled with righteous indignation.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it weren't for this damned old man hiding in the first place, Amelia wouldn't have gotten pregnant and wouldn't have gone through all this suffering.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul was afraid that James would go too far with his killing, and since Dominic had treated him fairly well, he wanted to save him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Eva disagreed, leaving him in a dilemma.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Paul didn't know what to do, a voice of urgency and panic suddenly came from the operating room:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The pregnant has a cerebral hemorrhage. Prepare the surgical knife. I need to perform a craniotomy immediately!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James, who was still venting his anger, froze in place upon hearing the doctor's words.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The aura of killing all dissipated in an instant, replaced by a despair that plunged him back into hell.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What did you say?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matty, standing outside the door, couldn't believe it and walked in.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why did she suddenly have a cerebral hemorrhage again?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The old doctor quickly glanced at James and Matty.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A pregnant with preeclampsia undergoing a cesarean section surgery can easily trigger complications such as cerebral hemorrhage and heart failure."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This patient has also had a heart transplant, and she just had a major hemorrhage, which caused cardiac arrest. It's not surprising that she has a cerebral hemorrhage."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After the old doctor finished speaking, he took the surgical knife handed to him by a nurse, and in a cold voice, he said:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The situation is urgent now, and there's no time to transfer the patient to another operating room. To prevent infection, I need everyone unrelated to the surgery to leave. Other doctors, guard the door and don't let any family members in. The remaining nurses, clean the operating room again."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After giving the instructions, the old doctor called Dr. Tenny to help turn the patient's body and ordered Dr. Gilbert to use a razor to shave Amelia's hair before stabilizing his fingers and quickly performing the craniotomy.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, James and Matty were forcefully escorted out by the doctors, and Dominic, lying on the ground, unconscious, was also dragged out...</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hugh had initially wanted to leave, but the old doctor stopped him. "Later, the patient will definitely develop complications such as heart failure and renal failure. You need to take over and perform hematoma evacuation and decompressive craniectomy."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hugh's ability to save the baby showed his skill, so performing a cerebral hemorrhage surgery shouldn't be a problem.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The old doctor was a general practitioner with great confidence in heart failure and renal failure. Just in case, it was better to have more doctors around.</span></p></div>
