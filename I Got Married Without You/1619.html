        <h1>Chapter 1619 Saying goodbyes</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia held the letter left by Stella, crying uncontrollably. Even though Stella herself </span><span>was in pain, Amelia's concern was still for her family and friends.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had promised Stella to be her family, to always be by her side and provide her with the warmth of a home, but she hadn't fulfilled these promises yet, and Stella had left like this...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In Amelia's memory, from the moment she met Stella, she had been helping her, whether it was curing her illness or standing up for her in times of danger. Stella was always at the forefront. How could such a good person like Stella be gone...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She couldn't accept it. Kneeling in front of Stella, she tightly embraced her stiff body, thinking that if she held onto her, Stella wouldn't leave...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She held on tightly, not letting anyone get close, trying to warm up Stella's cold body with her own body heat, like what Eva did. But everyone knew that Stella had already died, she couldn't come back to life. Amelia was just doing her best, trying to save her one last time...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva, sitting next to her, also kneeled and cried until her eyes were swollen. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She remembered when she chased after Stella with a bank card, determined to pay back the money to her. Stella had promised to leave a lot of money for Eva, and she actually left her life savings to Eva. It was foolish, but kind...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They didn't expect that such a kind person would end her own life. She was only in her thirties, the age of blooming flowers, yet she left in despair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For Eva, this scene was the second time she had experienced the pain of losing a close friend. The first time was Amelia, and now the second time was Stella. Eva's pain was no less than Amelia's, but she didn't know what to do. She could only kneel beside Stella, covering her lips and silently shedding tears...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Among the people in the birdcage room, Andrew cried the most heart-wrenchingly. Stella was his only family. He didn't understand why Stella would follow Erin. Did she feel guilty for killing Erin, or did she really love Erin so much that she was willing to abandon her family and friends to leave with her...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Andrew didn't quite understand this passionate love, he only knew that Stella was very foolish and pitiful. Her once bright life was ruined by his mother. Stella's tragedy was all because of his mother...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Andrew stared at Stella's pale face, tightly clenched his fists, and swore in his heart: Stella, don't worry, I will definitely make that old witch pay. I will avenge you...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James looked at Stella's stiff face and said in his heart, Stella, rest in peace. If there is a next life, may you find the love you deserve and live a happy life without having to sacrifice for anyone...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone said their goodbyes to Stella but hesitated to move her body. They were waiting for someone to arrive. Only when that person arrived could they cremate her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though everyone now knew that Stella didn't love Henry, Henry had given everything for Stella.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Henry received the news, he was still unwrapping the bandage on his wrist and applying medicine. When he heard that Stella had passed away, his eyes turned red almost instantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't believe it, but he immediately boarded the private plane arranged by James and hurriedly rushed to Panama, stumbling and falling along the way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Almost crawling, he entered the birdcage room and froze when he saw Stella in Amelia's arms. He couldn't believe that the person in front of him, who had no color in her face, was the same Stella who had been helping him change his bandages just a month ago.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had been laughing and talking with him during the bandage changes. Even when he asked her if she would have dinner with him once he got better, she had smiled and agreed. At that time, Henry thought he still had a chance, that he could take it slow. Who would have thought that in such a short time, she would...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was only at this moment that Henry realized that Stella loved Erin to this extent. If he had known that she loved Erin so much, he would never have come to the island and taken Stella away. Then Stella and Erin would have had a chance to reconcile, it was him...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was because he thought Stella didn't love Erin that he impulsively came to Panama and took Stella away, causing Erin's death and indirectly causing Stella's death...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Henry couldn't bear it. He knelt on the ground, unable to approach Stella, just staring at her with his bloodshot eyes...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm sorry, Stella. It's all my fault..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He shouldn't have come to the island, shouldn't have disturbed her and Erin. If it weren't for him, Erin wouldn't have died, Stella wouldn't have died...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Henry blamed himself for everything, overwhelmed with guilt and remorse. It made him feel icy cold all over, even his blood.</span></p></div>
