        <h1>Chapter 1634 Stay at home and wait for me</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After watching Koenigsek drive away, Eva returned to the master bedroom. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inside, Paul stood by the floor-to-ceiling window like a male model, unmoving, staring at the car that had disappeared in the distance downstairs. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva couldn't help but cough lightly when she saw him. "They're gone. When are you leaving?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul, who was smiling brightly like he had won a victory, quickly put away his smile and turned to look at Eva when he heard her voice. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing her neatly dressed, he squinted slightly. "I don't have any clothes to wear. How about you let me stay for another night?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was a hidden emotion in his eyes, somewhat obscure, but Eva understood clearly what he was suggesting. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She pretended not to notice and turned to open the closet in the master bedroom, taking out a set of men's clothing and handing it to Paul.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Paul saw that there were other men's clothes in her room, his expression darkened, but he knew he didn't have the right to question her at this moment, so he gritted his teeth and refused. "I'll have my assistant send clothes over later."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Implicitly, he meant that he wouldn't wear other men's clothes. After glancing at him, Eva shook out a shirt, turned the collar out, and held it up to Paul's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Paul's eyes touched the brand, he felt a surge of joy and quickly reached out to take it. "Why are you still keeping my clothes?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the day when Eva returned everything to Paul, she didn't know what happened, but she inexplicably left behind a set of clothes, probably as a memento. She didn't expect it to come in handy now, but she wouldn't admit to secretly keeping a man's clothes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mandy forgot to pack it, so I kept a set." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul stared into Eva's eyes, unable to determine whether her words were true or false. He simply reached out and hugged her along with the clothes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva struggled a few times, but Paul's strength was too strong, and she couldn't break free. She could only let him come close to her ear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Consider it the clothes you can't forget about me." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva pushed him away forcefully. "Hurry up and change your clothes and leave. I'm annoyed."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing her turn to leave, Paul grabbed Eva again and hugged her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Eva, I still want you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He deliberately rubbed his cheek against Eva's neck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"One more time, okay?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The tingling sensation from the friction made Eva's body stiff, and her ears gradually turned red. She raised her hand to push Paul's head away, but he didn't listen. He leaned in and captured her lips, kissing her with desire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Compared to the madness of last night, Paul was obviously much gentler at this moment. However, just one kiss suffocated Eva and made her body go weak...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were two conflicting thoughts fighting in her mind. She had been drunk last night, which made her do irrational things. Now that she was sober, she needed to push him away quickly...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva hesitated, but before she could make a decision, Paul pushed her down onto the sofa. Outside the floor-to-ceiling window, the sunset faded away, and darkness gradually descended...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva pushed Paul away with some difficulty, panting for breath. She clenched her small fists and waved them in front of Paul's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you mess around again, be careful I'll punch you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at her fierce appearance, the smile in Paul's eyes deepened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He grabbed both of Eva's hands with one hand and pressed them onto the sofa, making her unable to move. Then, he leaned close to Eva's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Eva, thank you for still having me in your heart..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Amelia had said that Eva still had him in her heart, he couldn't feel it. Now he felt it. Eva didn't resist him after what she had been through, which meant that he still had a place in her heart. As long as she had him in her heart, everything was worth it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With his other hand, Paul brushed away the messy hair that covered Eva's face. Then, he lowered his head and kissed her forehead with utmost sincerity and seriousness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll go inform my parents and propose to you again. Stay at home and wait for me, okay?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A strange emotion rippled in Eva's heart...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't respond to Paul verbally, but in her heart, she silently agreed. Paul couldn't hear it, but he took it as her approval.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After kissing her forehead and cheek again, Paul let go of her and, still smiling, deliberately loosened his towel...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva, who had previously felt somewhat touched, screamed in fright at the sight and jumped up, slapping his head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're asking for death!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After slapping him, Eva pushed him away and covered her face, running out of the master bedroom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Watching her fleeing figure, Paul rubbed his slightly sore forehead and the curve of his lips deepened...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From last night until now, the smile on his face hadn't faded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul thought that this moment might be the happiest moment of his life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After changing his clothes, Paul left the villa and didn't see Eva, but it didn't matter. They would see each other again soon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul returned to his own home, cleaned up, randomly picked a car from the garage, and headed towards the old house...</span></p></div>
