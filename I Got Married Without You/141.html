        <h1>Chapter 141 Defending Amelia</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jackson gazed over Lena. "Miss Weil, I brought my female companion to your house as a guest, but you slapped my woman publicly. Is this your upbringing?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing that Jackson had found out so quickly that she had hit him, Lena's heart skipped a beat, but her anger quickly dispelled it.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jackson didn't even bother to ask and was already defending Amelia. This was too much!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Miss Weil couldn't hold back her temper anymore. "Jackson, you didn't even ask who hit her before blaming me. How can you do this?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jackson's expression turned to darken. "So you didn't do it?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lena felt a little guilty, so she corrected herself. "Even if I did, you didn't ask me why. Isn't it too indistinguishable for you to say that about me?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jackson snorted, "I know Ms. Garcia very well. What's the point of asking?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lena didn't expect Jackson to talk to her like that for a female companion. She was so angry that her face turned pale. "Jackson, how can you do this to me..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jackson couldn't be bothered to watch her act. He said flatly, "Apologies to Ms. Garcia!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Harry was his good friend, he was not familiar with Lena. They had only met a few times, so he naturally would not show her respect.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing that Jackson wouldn't let her go until she apologized, Lena was so angry that she burst into tears. "Jackson, you're bullying me!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The little girl's cry soon attracted the attention of the crowd. Everyone was holding red wine and standing aside to watch the show, but no one came forward to help Lena.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing something was wrong, Lena quickly pointed at Amelia and slandered, "She was the one who scolded me first. I was so angry that I lost my mind and slapped her. I wouldn't have done this if it weren't for her stirring up trouble. I didn't do anything wrong!"</span></p></div>
