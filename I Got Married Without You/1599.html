        <h1>Chapter 1599 Mike sold out Karen</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Karen was determined that Erin had admitted to being the mastermind behind everything. But Stella didn't hear it firsthand; she was in the hospital at the time and Karen was the one who told her all the news.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because of this, Stella was shocked when she saw Bart giving money to those thugs. But at the same time, Stella wondered why Erin would admit it if she didn't send them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stella wanted to clear up these doubts, but it was clear that Karen wouldn't tell her. After hesitating for a moment, Stella stood up and walked over to Karen. Just like when they were kids, she squatted down next to Karen and placed her hand on her leg, looking up at her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aunt, I am your beloved niece. I have always treated you like a mother. We both came from a small town, and we should love, help, and trust each other. You know Mike is still young, and his cousins are all eyeing the position of heir. The Simpson family is a corporation, and who knows if one day those cousins will take over. If that happens, Mike's position as heir will be in danger."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even though I am in Arcadia, I have some influence behind me. If you trust me and tell me the truth, I will definitely help Mike become the heir of the Simpson family in the future."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These words were truly touching and struck a chord deep within Karen's heart. Before Erin died, Karen feared that Erin would become the heir. Now she had to fear Mike's cousins for the sake of her own son.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The corporate structure of the Simpson family was truly despicable, as if anyone could interfere. Thomas was the chairman, so why should others have a say in the position of the heir?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Karen was furious inside, but she didn't show it. She looked into Stella's innocent eyes and felt that Stella wasn't trying to deceive her into revealing the truth. But regardless of whether Stella was trying to deceive her or not, Karen couldn't reveal the truth. On the contrary, she had to stabilize Stella and make her help Mike in the future, using the power of the Evans family as her strong support.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With this in mind, Karen raised her hand and placed it on Stella's hand, gently patting it. She praised Stella for being sensible, saying, "Stella, I am so grateful to have a niece like you. If you are willing to help Mike, I can't shortchange you. How about this, when the Simpson family redistributes their shares, I will talk to your uncle and let you join in."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This way, Stella would have a share, and Mike would have a large portion. When it came time to choose the heir, Mike would definitely be ranked first and no one would be able to surpass him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mike, who was sitting next to them reading a book, blinked when he heard this. The Simpson family's shares were already divided, and now if Stella joined in, his share would be even smaller?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What if Stella found out the truth and chose not to help him, but instead helped someone else? That would be making enemies for him. Instead of taking this risky step, it would be better to completely cut off Stella's path to the Simpson Group, to avoid future trouble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking of this, Mike put down his book, took off his glasses, and looked coldly at Karen, who was inconsistent. "Karen, didn't you have Bart send someone to rape our cousin? Why don't you admit it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One sentence completely shocked Karen. Her widened pupils seemed to be saying, "How did you know?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was as if Mike could see through her thoughts. Expressionless, he said, "Two years ago, when you were arguing with Bart in the room, I happened to overhear."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Indeed, Bart had approached her two years ago, but she didn't want to give him money anymore. Bart then used the past incident to threaten her, and they had a heated argument. But she didn't expect Mike to hear it...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Mike was only five years old at the time. How could he have such a good memory? And why didn't he tell her at the time, but instead mentioned it when she suggested giving shares to Stella? Did he feel that his interests were being threatened?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Karen's shocked pupils, upon seeing the coldness in Mike's eyes, made her heart race nonstop. And then it sank heavily...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She suddenly felt that this son was so unfamiliar, even more unfamiliar than when Andrew angrily called her a mistress. At least Andrew thought she had wrong values and blamed her for not fighting back. But the feeling Mike gave her was cold to the bone...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She suddenly felt afraid. Someone like him could very well betray their own family for personal gain. Especially when this feeling came from a seven-year-old child...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Karen wanted to stand up and educate Mike, but her hand was held by Stella. Karen lowered her gaze and looked at Stella, who had turned pale with red eyes, trembling all over. It was only then that she remembered that Stella knew the truth. She quickly shook her head and denied, "I didn't do it. Mike misunderstood. He was only five at the time. What did he know?"</span></p></div>
