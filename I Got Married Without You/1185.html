        <h1>Chapter 1185 The story of James’ father (2)</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dominic felt guilty towards Gloria, it all started when the Leinster family married Gloria to his son for a business alliance, and he did it to completely cut off Clark's illegitimate daughter from his son's mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"On their wedding day, I drugged your father, not long after, Gloria became pregnant with your older brother, but your father was still obsessed with the woman from the Clark family. Gloria probably found out and was hurt, causing conflicts with your father throughout her pregnancy."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your father said Gloria was too controlling and a bit neurotic, and wanted to divorce her. Gloria loved your father deeply and had admired him since childhood. She naturally disagreed with the divorce. Your father was forced to stay out late often and sometimes stayed abroad for half a year..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's also my fault for being too soft-hearted at the time and not directly taking the girl's life. I just sent her away. Now, the two of them met again abroad. After </span><span>experiencing Gloria's violent temper as a wife, and encountering the woman he once loved but couldn't have, your father went crazy and it was simply unstoppable."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Speaking of this, the old man glanced at James with a gloomy expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He got the mistress pregnant. When Gloria found out, she went abroad and had the child aborted. Your father refused and even used the child to blackmail Gloria into divorcing him. "</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What could I do? On one hand, my son was begging me on his knees, and on the other hand, it was my personally chosen daughter-in-law. I was in a difficult position, but to be honest, people tend to favor their own. So I advised Gloria that the child was innocent. Gloria agreed, but said that either the child should be given up for adoption or the whole Evans family should be informed and they would punish the Clark family woman."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How could I let the Evans family know? So I agreed to give up the child for adoption, but your father refused and kept begging me on his knees. I had never seen him like that before, so I hesitated. Gloria saw my hesitation and directly took evidence of their affair and sent it to all the Evans family members."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Things escalated quickly. The Evans family forced me to execute the Clark family woman. I had no choice and was under too much pressure, so I didn't care about your father's life and had the Clark family woman kidnapped. When we were dealing with her, she cried and begged me to wait until she gave birth and she would fulfill her promise to commit suicide. I hesitated, but then G appeared and agreed to let the woman give birth."</span></p></div>
