        <h1>Chapter 1598 Two faces</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Karen glanced at the documents and felt a twinge in her heart. She hadn't expected Stella to investigate this after so many years. But she quickly composed herself, pretending not to know anything, reaching out for the documents with a surprised expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, I don't know. Why would he give those thugs money?" Karen took the documents, furrowing her brows and flipping through them. Stella sat opposite her, silently observing Karen, trying to detect any hint of emotions on her face. She could sense a hint of anger in Karen's eyes and eyebrows.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That bastard Bart, why would he give those bullies money who used to torment you?" After finishing reading the documents, Karen became so angry that she threw them away. Her elegant body trembled, clearly furious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If that bastard hadn't died two years ago, I would definitely bring him here and ask him why he did this." Indeed, Bart had passed away, making it impossible to confront him. Otherwise, Stella could have simply sought help from Andrew, captured Bart, found evidence, and then confronted Karen. Karen would have had nothing to say. So why bother coming here to extract information from her?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stella stared at the furious Karen and remained silent for a few seconds before saying softly, "Aunt, Bart transferred money to those people after they were released from prison. This proves that he was the one behind it. Otherwise, he wouldn't have a reason to give them money."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Karen's emotions flickered in her eyes, but she didn't show it. "Wasn't Erin the mastermind? He admitted it himself when we interrogated him. How could it be your uncle? Maybe Bart owed those thugs money, so he sent them the money after they were released. You know what desperate people like them are capable of. Perhaps your gambling-addicted uncle was afraid of being hunted down by them, so he gave them the money."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Karen found a reasonable excuse for Bart, but Stella didn't believe it. "Aunt, those thugs were associated with Erin. They're much younger than your uncle. How could your uncle borrow money from them? Besides, your uncle always gambles abroad. How could he dare to have any dealings with these people? And those thugs don't have much money. Why would your uncle borrow money from them?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Karen was somewhat speechless under interrogation but refused to admit it. "Stella, I really don't know much about your uncle's affairs. He never told me who he associated with, who he gambled with, or how much money he owed. He always just asked me for money... Perhaps your uncle did have contact with Erin's people in secret. Perhaps Erin bribed your uncle and made him do something to hurt you. You know your uncle had a lot of gambling debts. When I refused to lend him money, he got angry and went to see Erin. It's possible they conspired together."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stella knew it would be very difficult to get the truth about why Bart made the payments from Karen. So she decided to play the emotional card. "Aunt, you should know about Bart's situation. He relied on you his whole life. If he really was bribed by Erin and did something bad to me, he would have definitely told you. Now that Erin is dead and our grievances have been settled, I won't argue with you over his actions or blame you for hiding anything. I just want to know the truth."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Karen calmly looked at Stella and saw the respectful and friendly gaze, just like before, without a hint of hatred. Her heart softened slightly, but she shook her head. "Stella, I really don't know why your uncle would give money to those thugs."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying that, she let out a long sigh. "Now that Bart is dead, no one knows why he did this. But if you say he was the mastermind, I find it hard to believe. After all, Erin really did admit to sending people back then."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Karen now agreed with Stella's words and said that Bart was the mastermind, Stella would suspect that Karen was somehow involved herself. So Karen decided to push the blame onto Erin. After all, Erin did have such intentions back then, even if it was just to scare Stella. What harm would it do to go along with it?</span></p></div>
