        <h1>Chapter 1711 Will you come back safely?</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just hearing the words "leaving" made Amelia's heart race with nervousness. "Where are you going?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James gently touched her face, his expression filled with reluctance. "I'll tell you when I come back."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were other people in the car, so James couldn't speak freely. Amelia guessed that it had something to do with S, so she didn't ask any further questions. Instead, she got out of the car and sat next to him, remaining silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After they got married, Amelia rarely became quiet and reserved. This was the first time it had happened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James felt nervous when he saw Amelia like this. He couldn't help but reach out and tug on her clothes, "Amelia..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia ignored him and turned her head to look out the car window. The emotions stirring inside her were all fear. Even though she didn't know what S's mission was, she knew that anything too secretive was always unpredictable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She loved James so much that she couldn't bear the thought of losing him. She wished he could break away from the organization and stay by her side forever. But she also knew that James was the leader of the organization and he couldn't leave or be with her all the time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She ignored him, and James felt very anxious. "Amelia, I..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia turned her head and interrupted him, "Let's talk about it later."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She only said this before turning her head to look outside the window again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As James gazed at her cold profile, he suddenly hesitated to get any closer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They traveled in silence all the way to the airport."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Until they boarded the plane, James didn't let Amelia hug him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James had no choice but to withdraw his hand and sit on the side, silently watching Amelia's figure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She must have sensed that she was about to do something dangerous. She didn't want him to go, but she also knew he had to. She was at a loss and could only choose to be stubborn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James knew exactly what she was thinking, but he didn't care whether she wanted it or not. He simply reached out his bony hand and tightly embraced her from behind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His scorching chest pressed against her back, warming her icy skin and slowly thawing her heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia was hopeless. She turned her body and hugged James tightly, burying herself in his arms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They couldn't bring up the matter on the plane, so they just held each other in silence, like a couple about to face a heartbreaking separation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they arrived home, it was already late at night. The two of them stepped into the room, one in front and one behind, standing still and not saying a word to each other.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the end, Amelia finally let go of all her exhaustion and turned to James, asking, "When are you leaving?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James put away the sadness in his expression and stepped forward to wrap his arms around her waist. "In ten days."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The time was already set, indicating that he had been prepared to leave long ago, but he only told her now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia was a little angry, "How long do I have to leave for?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James said lightly, "One month."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He only gave himself one month, and only allowed Amelia to wait for one month.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia lowered her gaze, seemingly lost in thought. What would happen in this month without James?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought for a long time, but couldn't come up with an answer. He was still there, and they had never been apart since they got married.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She held her breath and remained silent for a long time. Then, she clenched her fists and asked the most feared question, "Will you come back safely?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James froze for a moment. Last time he went to Erebus, he almost lost half of his life. This time... Emily and Mr. Ben both knew his identity, but he didn't know what would happen. He was very uneasy, but he wouldn't tell her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't respond for a long time. Amelia, feeling anxious, pushed his hand away and turned around. With tears in her eyes, she asked him, "James, will you come back safely?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James felt a pang of sympathy when he saw the tears in Amelia's eyes. He nodded and said, "I will, I'll come back safely."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His promise was just a promise, no one can predict the future. Amelia felt very uneasy and couldn't help but rush forward, tightly hugging James' waist. "Honey, can you not go?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Could he stay and just be her husband, living a peaceful life together forever?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James raised his slender hand and gently stroked Amelia's back. "Master Davies promised me that if I complete this task, I can finally break free from S and spend the rest of my life with you by my side."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He made the final deal with Master Davies in order to spend the rest of his life with Amelia. James was not heartless, in fact, he valued loyalty and friendship. Even in a trade, he was willing to risk his life and not just to repay Master Davies for his teachings, but also to save the lives of countless others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James didn't want to choose between loyalty and love, so he decided to make them coexist. He spent a month fulfilling his loyalty and the rest of his life devoted to love. This was what James believed he should do.</span></p></div>
