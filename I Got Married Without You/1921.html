        <h1>Chapter 1921 She must be in so much pain</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The staggering man grabbed Amelia's cold hand and pressed it against his own face.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her fingertips were covered in blood, quickly staining James' pale face red.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James lowered his gaze, slowly taking in her bloody body. She must be in so much pain, he thought.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For the first time, he realized that caring for someone meant more than just feeling sorry for them.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It meant wanting to take their pain and suffering upon oneself.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it were possible, he would take on all of her burdens.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was willing to endure any punishment as long as it meant sparing Amelia from torment. He would do anything, even die for her.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James lowered his heavy and exhausted face, holding onto Amelia's hand as he leaned over the operating table.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His tall and imposing figure bent down in a posture resembling a penitent worshipper.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even from outside the operating room, one could see the trembling of the man towering above.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one could guess if he was crying at that moment, but everyone knew that he was suffering beyond words.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To be alive yet wishing for death, that was the greatest agony.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, James had experienced the life and death struggles of his wife and child.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one knew how he had endured these past twenty hours, but they knew that someone like him must be in immense pain.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva cried out in anguish, her heart torn apart. If it weren't for Paul supporting her, she would have collapsed on the ground.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rebecca, hearing Eva's cries, reached out and tightly held her hand, silently giving her strength.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Evans family sympathized with Amelia's ordeal and felt for James' helplessness.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After learning about their own grandfather's actions, they felt a chill in their hearts.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Knowing that Amelia was James' life, Dominic still went ahead with his plan. Such a grandfather was rare in the world, and how could his grandchildren not feel chilled by his actions?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Compared to the Evans family's concern for James, the Lawrence family's concern was solely for Amelia, especially Dylan.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just a few days ago, they had met at the airport, embraced each other, and Amelia had even asked him to name their child.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How could it be that in such a short time, seeing his sister again would be in such a bloody state?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dylan, with a gunshot wound in his chest, could hardly believe his eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He grabbed Owen and Eugene's hands, asking them to support him as he walked into the operating room. Being closer now, he could see even more clearly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he saw that Amelia's hair, which used to cascade down to her waist like seaweed, had been shaved off, Dylan's eyes turned red.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew that his sister loved her appearance, but now, her once beautiful hair was gone.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her whole body was covered in wounds, with no good place left, just blood everywhere.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, the all-capable old doctor by their grandfather's side said that Amelia was in a deep coma and essentially beyond saving.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was his sister, whom he had only recently recognized, how could she just be gone like that?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matty felt heartbroken, leaning on his cane, turning away and not wanting to stay here.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The smell of his granddaughter's blood and the sight of her being neither alive nor dead were unbearable.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Outside the door, Carson saw Matty leave and his gaze shifted back to Amelia. Seeing her condition, he couldn't help but wonder about Sumasa's daughter.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She truly had a tumultuous fate. He just didn't know if she would be as lucky this time as she was when she survived the sea incident.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he thought this, Carson noticed Johnny, a young man of similar height to James, who had followed him into the operating room when James entered.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But it seemed that Johnny didn't know how to approach Amelia, so he could only stand there like a statue, not far from the operating table.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carson didn't go in, so he couldn't see Johnny's expression, but he could see his trembling figure swaying several times.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it weren't for Herb supporting him, Johnny might have been scared unconscious.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just from that swaying figure, Carson could sense Johnny's thoughts, but it seemed that these thoughts would forever remain hidden in his heart.</span></p></div>
