        <h1>Chapter 1948 Use your mouth</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>During this period, Amelia had been sleeping with her son and was reluctant to let go of him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, she also knew that she couldn't ignore her husband's feelings.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So she nodded and said, "Okay, tonight I'll help him take a bath and then let Grace put him to sleep."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James raised an eyebrow with a good mood and reached out his finger, wanting to touch his son's face.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Alexander turned away and hugged Amelia tightly, not giving him a chance to touch him at all.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James's finger froze in mid-air for a moment, then he patted Alexander's bottom. Alexander was not happy about it and kept squirming and resisting.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James could see through the little baby&rsquo;s thoughts, but he didn't expect Alexander to understand him at such a young age.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, even if he understood, what could he do? He couldn't even speak, let alone compete with him for Amelia.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After the family had dinner, Amelia took Alexander to take a bath.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although they had a nanny, Amelia felt that she had been absent for too long and wanted to make up for it by taking care of her baby herself.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With James's help, Amelia carefully washed the baby and wrapped him in a small towel, then used other towels to dry his hair.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing the clean and fragrant baby, Amelia couldn't help but lower her head and kiss his little head. "Honey, look how cute Alexander is. I can't bear to let go of him every day."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James, who had just fetched his pajamas, glanced at Alexander sitting on the bathtub, looking very content. "Darling, my knee has been hurting lately. You'll have to spend some time massaging it for me tonight."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing that his knee was hurting, Amelia became nervous and turned around. "Then you should go back to the bedroom and lie down. I'll put the baby to sleep and come back to help you with the massage."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James didn't listen to her and instead walked over to Alexander, picking him up and holding him in his arms. "I'll put him to sleep."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander, who was forcefully pressed on his shoulder by James, struggled wildly, but he was soon carried by James to Grace's room.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing that Alexander would be sleeping in Grace's room tonight, Frank added a crib to the room.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James wanted to put down Alexander, but his little arms clung to his neck and refused to let go.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James was in a hurry to go back to sleep with his wife.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't have time to comfort his son. He grabbed Alexander's little arm and quickly put him into the crib.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James casually pulled over a small blanket and covered his belly, then raised his hand to close his eyes. "Your sister is still practicing calligraphy in the study. She'll come back when she's done. You go to sleep first."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a hurry, James left after saying that.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After the door closed, Alexander squirmed his body, stared at his legs, grabbed the high crib rail, and used it to climb up...</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When James came back, Amelia reached out and patted the sofa at the end of the bed. "Honey, lie down quickly. I'll apply some ointment for you and massage your knee."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His knee was strained and would occasionally hurt.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia consulted a doctor who told her to use some pain-relieving ointment and massage it to alleviate the pain.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James could endure the pain in his knee, but what he couldn't endure was that he and Amelia hadn't made love for so long.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>First, Amelia hadn't fully recovered, so James didn't dare to touch her and was afraid she would get pregnant again.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, after this period of adjustment, that concern had been resolved.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Second, every night, there would always be a sleeping baby between them.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James had been holding it in for too long. Before Amelia could pull him down, he bent over and carried her to the bed. "Darling, tonight, give me a few more times."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Amelia was pinned to the bed, she saw him spread his knees apart, kneeling beside her, and then lowered his head to passionately kiss her.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She couldn't help but worry, "Can your knee handle it?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James rolled his Adam's apple and made a low sound before lowering his head to passionately kiss her. "Darling, get a condom."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Afraid of getting pregnant, James had prepared a lot of condoms and put them in the bedside table.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were so many that Amelia felt embarrassed to look at them. But James grabbed her hand and asked her to get one.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While enduring the frenzy of the man trying to take off his clothes, Amelia reached out and opened the drawer, pulling out a plastic wrapper.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wanted to tear it open, but James lowered his voice and whispered in her ear, "Use your mouth."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia couldn't resist James biting her ear, as it was very sensitive.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She instinctively dodged, but the man captured her wrist and couldn't wait. He took off her underwear and then lowered his head to kiss her chest...</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This position was even more sensitive than her ears.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With just a few teasing touches, Amelia's body turned into a puddle of water, and certain parts of her tightened.</span></p></div>
