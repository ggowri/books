        <h1>Chapter 1832: A Beacon</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James felt fate was mocking him, laughing bitterly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Matty was unfazed by his wild appearance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You </span><span>got ten</span><span> minutes," he said, exiting the lab, followed by his men in black.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dylan stayed back, advising, "Just agree for now. You can explain to Amelia once you're free."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dylan! I'm not deaf," Matty's chilling voice stopped him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Startled, Dylan quickly shut up and left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Outside, Matty unmasked, showing his icy eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Twenty lashes for you," he ordered Dylan, who complied fearfully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matty then gave out tasks, "Dylan, start the program in the control room. Others, transfer the chips, then destroy the chip room."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After, Matty warned everyone not to talk about the chip or James' ordeal in Erebus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He specifically mentioned Carson, who was puzzled by Matty's irrational orders far away in Chiang Rai.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once everything was set, Matty led the remaining men to the bio-lab, resuming his position of dominance overlooking James.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Made up your mind yet?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James' eyes quivered slightly but he gave no response.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matty wasn't in a hurry, instead, he sat back on the couch, patiently waiting for James' answer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James knew that to remove the chip's control, 1-1 had to contradict his conditions of not limiting James' freedom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This condition seemed beneficial for James, but the real winner would be 1-1. He was smart, advantageous to himself yet holding James' Achilles heel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Having been a business tycoon for years, James knew he had met a formidable adversary this time. Yet, he merely curled his lips into a hollow smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're a curse to Amelia," he said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Perhaps. But without S, she wouldn't be in this mess."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sophia had been killed by S. If she hadn't been murdered, then Amelia's mother wouldn't have married Brandon, and Amelia wouldn't be suffering like she was now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James eyed the masked man. He briefly wondered about the link between Amelia's woes and 'S', but resentment for Matty took over. Anyway, his brothers' deaths wouldn't go unpunished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that thought, James' icy gaze hardened even more, his eyes burning with hatred towards 1-1. Though he was in a vulnerable position, he hid his rage well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Remove your mask if you want my compliance."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tomorrow, Amelia will come and she'll spill everything."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matty knew his secret role as Erebus's founder wouldn't stay hidden but revealing it too early would tip off Amelia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Self-protective, Matty swapped identities with James in a negotiation, keeping his own a secret.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He suspected Amelia knew who 'S's founder was, planning to use James to subtly test her. He controlled everything, not caring about James' fate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James' piercing eyes stared back, predator-like.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you release me, I'll leave her, but won't be cold," James offered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aware of Amelia's fear of his frosty manner, he vowed not to repeat it, promising to treat her kindly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was James' compromise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Matty overstepped, he risked awakening a sleeping lion, causing unforeseen trouble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Deal," Matty agreed, blocking James, "But if you try to reconcile or explain, I'll trigger the end - terminate her pregnancy, even kill the baby if born!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a stern warning, Matty bolted from the couch to the control room, aiming to tweak James' brain chip for better control.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once he was gone, James tilted his head, his thick lashes casting a large, lonely shadow under the light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dominic once said his love was his Achilles heel; he was right. Amelia and their child were his weak points.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But as a husband, he couldn't stand Amelia's slightest suffering. So, his weakness also became his strength, a beacon guiding him through the darkness.</span></p></div>
