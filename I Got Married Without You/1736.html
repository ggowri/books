        <h1>Chapter 1736 Invitation Cards</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia said, "Mr. Brook, I'm not there to have fun, I'm there to see my husband."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Johnny glanced at her for a second, "What's wrong with you looking for your husband and me looking for my brother-in-law?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia was dumbfounded by the dislike and Johnny asked her again, "I know the specifics of what's going on inside Erebus, do you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was afraid Holden would sense she was going to Erebus and hadn't approached him for specifics, she shook her head, "I'll just know the address."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Johnny's goggle-eyed demeanor grew cold, "How did you know Erebus's address?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia hesitates for a moment before choosing to trust Johnny, removing the gold leaf and note and handing it to him, " I don't know Erebus's address, but there was a little girl, who gave me these two things." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Johnny took it, glanced at the note, then picked up the gold leaf and examined it, "This gold leaf, is an invitation card for Erebus, and the letter E on the back, is the code name for Erebus."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He tore his eyes away from the gold leaf and looked to Amelia, "The people behind Erebus send invitation cards to people if they're particularly interested in them, and the fact that you've got this means they've got their eye on you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia frowned softly, "Is the fact that they're on to me a sign that James isn't dead and they want to use me as a threat as a way to control him?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Johnny shook his head, "I'd like to think they're using James as a threat to lure you in, after all, James is already deep in Erebus and they can just control him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia sniffed and breathed a deep sigh of relief, as long as her presence would not threaten James, "And why would they want to lure me in?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Johnny handed the gold leaf back to her, "Inevitably, there is value in keeping an eye on you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia wondered, "What value can I have?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Johnny reached out with thin white fingers and tapped her steering wheel, "Go to the docks and I'll tell you on the way."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia stared at Johnny, hesitated for a moment, and then, without further ado, started the car and drove straight toward the docks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Johnny doesn't tell Amelia on the way what value she has to Erebus, because he doesn't know either.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he did give a full account of what was going on in Erebus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>First of all, there was the origin of Erebus. Erebus was ostensibly a place for the rich and gamblers to have fun, but in actuality, it was set up initially to target the S. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, after failing to find out for a long time which members of the S were involved, no action had been launched.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Abuse, like Holden was talking about, was also recent, and it's due to the fact that within S, a member named Mr. Ben defected, took a list of some of S's members, and defected to Erebus, and that's why S was brutally abused.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for the hatred between S and Erebus, and why Mr. Ben didn't expose James and their identities, Johnny said that Holden wasn't sure either, and only knew that the manipulator behind the scenes of Erebus was even more powerful than S's founder, Master Davies, or else Master Davies wouldn't have been at his wits' end to the extent that, time and time again, he sent his members in to work as an undercover, and even sent James in the end.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The fact that a leader liked James had to go undercover personally to find the mastermind behind the scenes only meant that a manipulator like Erebus, who played with high tech and was mysterious and unpredictable, was bound to be either an even match with or above them, but it's hard to say who exactly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, there were many others who were equal to them, or above them, all over the world, such as the invisible rich in Central Europe, the low-profile aristocrats in Southern Europe, and the Scandinavian royal families, as well as the momentum in North America, Australia, or the uncharted territories, there were just too many, and anyone could be a manipulator of Erebus.</span></p></div>
