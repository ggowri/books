        <h1>Chapter 1596 Mia was pregnant</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Standing in front of her, Andrew felt something strange when he saw Bart's name, and immediately reminded Stella, "That thing back then was likely Karen's doing. Otherwise, her cousin wouldn't have coincidentally sent money to these people, and the amount in each account is the same... Even though it was divided into several transactions, they all went through similar routes. If the person behind this is Erin, then she must have directly opened foreign bank accounts for these people and manipulated them so that no one could trace anything. Only someone like Karen, who lacks education, would transfer money to multiple accounts in a gradual manner..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stella's mind was a bit hazy, and she leaned on Andrew for support to steady herself. She grabbed Andrew's arm and slowly sat down on the couch...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing her like this, Andrew immediately pulled out the small knife he had tucked at his waist and was about to go to Imperial Capital to kill someone. "I'll go and bring that woman here and find out what's going on?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stella stopped him with her hand. "I'll go myself."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wanted to ask Karen why she transferred money to these people and why she laughed when she saw Erin's urn, but cried at the funeral after returning to Imperial Capital. She wanted to ask her loving aunt why she had two faces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With great effort, she supported herself and stood up, but Andrew was worried about her and wanted to go with her. Just then, Mia's phone call came in...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Stella saw the corners of Andrew's lips gradually lift and heard him repeatedly say, "Really?" she vaguely guessed what the good news was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sure enough, after Andrew hung up the phone, his face lit up with joy as he said to Stella, "Stella, your sister-in-law is pregnant!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stella's heavy heart was unable to contain its joy upon hearing this good news. "That's great!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Andrew was overjoyed and wanted to rush to the hospital to pick up Mia, but when he saw Stella, he quickly suppressed his excitement. "Let's go, I'll accompany you back to Imperial Capital first."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was rare for her brother to go this far, but Stella had to be sensible. "Mia just got pregnant and needs company. You should go and be with her. I'll go find Aunt myself..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Andrew had already established a family. Now, this family had added a new member. The role Andrew played in Stella's life was not only her brother, but also her husband and father. He was already busy enough, so she shouldn't burden him with her own issues.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Furthermore, Andrew had cut ties with the Simpson family, while she had a close connection with them. She could even say that she was raised by the Simpson family. It was normal for her to ask questions. It would be better for Andrew not to get involved in the relationship and situation with the Simpson family to avoid any conflicts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Andrew's intention was to go to Imperial Capital with her after he picked up Mia from the hospital, but Stella refused. She was only going to find Aunt and clarify what was going on, not to fight with Karen. Nothing would happen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Andrew also believed that Stella wouldn't conflict with her beloved aunt because of Erin's matter, so he didn't try to persuade her further. Instead, he assigned a few bodyguards to protect her and instructed Stella to call him if anything happened. Stella agreed with a nod, and then she went to Imperial Capital with the bodyguards.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Andrew went to the CEO's office to ask James for an extended leave. Maybe because of Mia's pregnancy, he was overly happy. When he pushed open the door, he couldn't contain his smile, even with his hand covering it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James, who was reviewing documents, raised his cold eyes when he heard Andrew occasionally burst into laughter. He coldly glanced at him and asked, "What's so funny?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Andrew, who was waiting for Mr. Evans to ask, quickly moved his hands away from his covered smile and rushed to James's desk, using both hands to support himself. "Mr. Evans, my wife is pregnant. I'm here to request a few days off..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James, with eyes as cold as snow, had been staring at Andrew's hands on his desk. But when he heard what Andrew said, he slowly moved his disdainful gaze away and looked at Andrew's smiling face...</span></p></div>
