        <h1>Chapter 1721 Why don't you dare to look me in the eye?</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia sat on the windowsill, clutching the letter, waiting silently for James. Suddenly, Frank burst through the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ma'am, Holden has returned."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing these words, Amelia was momentarily stunned. Then, a glimmer of hope suddenly appeared in her otherwise dull eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't even bother to put on her shoes, and ran barefoot past Frank, quickly stepping onto the revolving staircase and rushing into the living room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sitting straight on the couch, Holden heard the sound of someone coming downstairs behind him and slowly turned around...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as Amelia saw Holden's familiar face, tears welled up in her clear and pure eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Holden returned safely, did that mean James also returned unharmed?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia took a step forward and walked up to Holden.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Where is he?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Holden lowered his eyelashes, hiding the sadness in his eyes, and said softly, "He... hasn't come back yet."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia's heart sank as the hope that had just ignited was completely extinguished. "When will he be able to come back?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Holden tightened his fingers on his knee. "Didn't he write to you and tell you to wait another two months? There's still 22 days left, just hold on a little longer."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia's eyes were fixed on Holden's pale face, "Holden, why did you come back, but he didn't?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Holden's already pale face turned even whiter at the sound of this question, draining all color from his cheeks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He gritted his teeth in pain and guilt, looking at Amelia. "He still has a mission to complete, so he asked me to come back and let you know that he's safe."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Did he send Holden back to report his safety because he was afraid she would worry?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If that was the case, it meant he's okay, he was still alive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia's heart clenched, but she managed to calm down a bit. "So how is he? Is he injured?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All she worried about was James getting hurt, getting into trouble, or not coming back. As long as he was okay, she didn't mind waiting however long it took.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Holden's fingers trembled as he gripped his suit pants, but he forced himself to let go and put on a strained smile to reassure Amelia, "He's fine, he didn't get hurt."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If anyone else had said this, Amelia wouldn't believe it. But it's coming from Holden, who went with James and came back unharmed. That proves that what he's saying is trustworthy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia finally relaxed and took a step back, sitting down on the couch. "So, can you tell me where you've been during this time and what happened?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under Amelia's eager gaze, Holden awkwardly lowered his eyelashes again. "I can't tell you where we're going. And even if I told you what happened, you probably wouldn't understand."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia looked at Holden, who seemed unwilling to reveal any information. She couldn't shake the feeling that he was hiding something from her. "Mr. Davies, if something bad has happened, please just tell me directly. I can handle it," she said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had also experienced life and death, so what couldn't she endure? If something really happened to James, she would just go and be with him. It wasn't a big deal, just a regret that their time together was too short.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Holden couldn't bring himself to meet Amelia's gaze, but he still kept the truth hidden. "Mrs. Evans, our mission is not something we can share with anyone. I hope you can understand and forgive us. And as for why I am here, it is at the request of Mr. Shawn. Please trust him, and trust me as well."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He spoke sincerely because James had indeed entrusted him with this task, and Amelia would never have guessed that Holden and the letter were all part of James' calculated plan to keep her from worrying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia looked at Holden, who was always too afraid to meet her gaze, with confusion in her eyes. "Why are you so afraid to look at me directly?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Holden was taken aback by Amelia's words, but he quickly composed himself and looked up at her. "Mrs. Evans, your clothes are disheveled. It's probably best if I stay away."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia followed his gaze and glanced at her clothes, which were indeed a bit messy. She quickly gathered her coat and wrapped it around herself. Despite feeling embarrassed, she forced a smile at Holden and said, "Sorry, I thought you were back, but then he came back, so I got a little excited..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't even bother to tidy up her clothes before running downstairs, but she still couldn't find her James.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Holden tried to remain calm and waved his hand, "It's okay."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying that, Holden stood up and said, "Since I've let you know I'm safe, I'll be on my way now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia also stood up and asked, "Mr. Davies, when will Zack be back?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Holden's body stiffened suddenly, and he didn't even dare to turn his head. "He stayed there with Mr. Shawn."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia couldn't understand the hidden meaning behind this statement, "So after 22 days, will they come back together?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Holden stood tall, his back showing a hint of exhaustion but he forced himself to stay steady, nodding lightly. "Yeah."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia's anxious heart gradually calmed down. "If Gigi knew that Zack would be back soon, she would be able to relax and take care of herself."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Holden turned around abruptly, looking at Amelia in disbelief. "Gigi is pregnant?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia noticed his surprised expression and also became suspicious. "Yeah, it was discovered after Zack left. What's wrong?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Holden stared at Amelia, his mind blank for a moment before slowly coming back to reality. "That's great, Zack became a father."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia was about to ask him again when Holden suddenly pulled up the corners of his mouth and gave a bitter smile. "Congratulations for me," he said.</span></p></div>
