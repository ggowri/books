        <h1>Chapter 1646 Paul dismantled the house</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Back at Paul's place, he demolished the old house. He smashed everything inside, including centuries-old antiques. It was like he was a madman, unstoppable and wreaking havoc. Kate, seeing her own son's intense reaction, was both angry and furious. "Paul, do you have no conscience? Treating your own parents like this just for a woman?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul, holding a baseball bat, continued smashing things while speaking coldly. "You knew I wanted to marry Eva, yet you still had to interfere. So where is your conscience?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing everything on the antique shelves knocked to the ground, Eric, filled with anger, couldn't hold back any longer and rushed forward. "Paul, what do you think you're doing?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Make my mom apologize to Eva, or I'll smash everything you've collected. I won't leave a single bottle for you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eric, who usually had no authority, was infuriated by these words. He was out of breath from anger. "Your mother did it for your own good. If you can't appreciate it, fine. But how can you make her lower herself and apologize to a stranger?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing this, Paul swung his bat again and shattered a row of vases on the antique shelf. "If you really cared about me, you should have helped me with the wedding instead of going behind my back to meet the woman I want to marry and </span><span>saying all sorts of cold-hearted things!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Witnessing his beloved vases turning into fragments, Eric felt immense pain. "These vases have a history of over a hundred years, some worth millions. And you just smashed them all, you wasteful child..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eric was so angry he almost fainted, but the servants held him up just in time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing her husband in such a state, Kate rushed forward to stop Paul, but he pushed her away. "Mom, you better apologize to Eva. Otherwise, I'll come here every day to smash things. If you won't let me live well, I won't let you live well!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you want to smash, then go ahead. I won't apologize to her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kate had never heard of a situation where an elder apologizes to a younger person. This was the first time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Besides, proud as Kate was, how could she possibly bow down to a nightclub girl?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dream on!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you don't apologize, I'll come here every day to smash things!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul was also stubborn. If his parents wouldn't let him have a good life, he wouldn't let them have one either. Let's see who could outlast whom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Watching Paul wrecking their home, no matter how angry Kate was, she forced herself to calm down. "The more you act like this, the less I'll agree to let her in."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul sneered, "It's not about whether you agree or not. It's about me not agreeing to let you bully her. You better apologize to her in Germany right away!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing this, Kate's face turned red with anger. "And you expect me to go to Germany to apologize to her? Is she even worthy?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul snatched a painting that Eric was protecting in his arms and tore it to pieces. "If you care about my dad, then have the audacity to apologize to her!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing the paper scraps flying everywhere, Eric couldn't contain his anger. "Paul, if you have conflicts with your mother, why destroy my things? I didn't do anything to you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Watching Eric squatting on the ground picking up pieces of paper, Kate gave Paul a cold look and said, "You should be thankful that your father and I don't have violent tendencies."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In any other family, if a child had destroyed the house like this, they would have started beating the child long ago. How did it come to this, with Paul swaggering around and causing chaos?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul couldn't be bothered with Kate anymore. After demolishing the collection room, he dragged the baseball bat and smashed the living room, kitchen, lounge, bedroom, one by one, making a mess of everything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Afterwards, Paul violently dismissed all the household staff and made his parents serve him, doing his laundry and cooking for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In addition, he took the opportunity to come home every day and smash things while cursing the couple. Whatever irked him, he would do it.</span></p></div>
