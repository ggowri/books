        <h1>Chapter 1981 There He Is</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia had no choice but to send the doctor away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Peter, who had been waiting outside, immediately asked, "Grace and Alexander just came asking about Mr. Evans. What should I tell them?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Amelia could answer, James' cold and indifferent voice came from inside. "Tell them I have a cold. They don't need to worry."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Peter acknowledged and left, leaving Amelia standing alone, hands and feet icy, outside the bedroom door. She didn't know how much longer the man behind her could stay with her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From this night, she was suddenly engulfed in the fear of losing James at any moment. Even though he was still there, she couldn't sleep day or night...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the day Alexander went abroad for his studies, both the Evans family and the Lawrence family came to see him off. The garden was filled with people, just like on his first birthday celebration. But ten years had passed, people had changed, and the children had grown up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander perfectly inherited Amelia and James' excellent genes. Although he was only ten years old, his refined features and upright posture already showed signs of future grace. With an IQ of 180, anyone who saw him couldn't help but exclaim, "What a gorgeous boy!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Especially Paul, who, upon seeing Alexander descend the spiral staircase, dressed in a white sweater with one hand in his pocket and a single-strap bag slung over his shoulder, couldn't help but gasp.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then he glanced at his own children, still in their elementary school uniforms, fighting over cake. He took another deep breath. "They're both ten years old, yet he's going to a world-renowned school while these two fools are still in elementary school. It's driving me crazy!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva rolled her eyes at him. "The apple doesn't fall far from the tree. I've told you this many times, haven't I?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul ground his teeth and walked over to the kids, snatching the cake they were fighting over and stuffing it into his mouth. "If you two don't skip grades to high school by the end of eighth grade, I'll kick your ass!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxwell and Margot deflated like punctured balloons. "Dad, aren't your expectations for us a bit too high?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Paul was about to shout, a vase fell in the living room. It was knocked over by Beth, and all the people immediately surrounded her, lifting her up and asking if she was okay.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beth shook her head while looking at Alexander, who had already descended the spiral staircase. When her eyes met his sharp features, it was as if she had been burned, and she instinctively lowered her head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When she saw Alexander coming down in his white sweater, she suddenly panicked, feeling both afraid and heart-struck. She hadn't expected to feel this way upon seeing him again, which caused her to knock over the vase.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feeling embarrassed, she didn't dare to look at him again. Yet, as Alexander walked past her, he sneered at her in front of all the people, "Idiot."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beth felt extremely embarrassed. Grace quickly comforted her. "He has always been that nasty. Don't take any notice of him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beth lowered her eyes, thinking he was right. She was an idiot. But she swore to herself that if she ever looked at Alexander again, she would blind herself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she made this vow, a refined and gentlemanly figure entered from outside. "Grace, did you steal my textbook?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grace had been shadow-boxing at Alexander's retreating figure, but upon hearing the voice, she quickly composed herself, adopting a ladylike posture.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beth was shocked. Grace tucked her hair behind her ear and said, "How could I possibly steal your textbook?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing this, Beth realized who this was and couldn't help but smile. She and Grace often video-called each other.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>During Grace's infatuation phase, she had often talked about a boy named Phil Sherwood. Now, seeing him in person, she thought Grace had good taste.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Beth sized up Phil, he had already walked up to Grace, extending his long fingers towards her. "Return it now, or I won't be able to explain to the teacher at school tomorrow."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grace and Phil had grown up together, but he never seemed to like her and was always harsh. Despite her crush, she didn't tolerate him now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I told you, I didn't take your textbook. If you're going to accuse me, at least come up with a better excuse. If you can't, then get out of my house and don't humiliate me in front of my friends."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Phil glanced at Beth. "Sorry."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a polite apology, he quickly looked back at Grace. "Stop messing around. If it makes you happy, I won't change seats next year. We can stay desk mates."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grace raised an eyebrow at him. "Promise? Next year in senior year, you'll stay my desk mate, and we'll apply to the same university."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Phil nodded reluctantly. In reality, he secretly changed his college application, and it took him five years of pursuing her before she finally turned back to him.</span></p></div>
