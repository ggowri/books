        <h1>Chapter 1667 Eva got pregnancy</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva didn't know what to say when she looked at Elsie like this. She lowered her long eyelashes and stared blankly at the voice recorder in her hand. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They all said that Paul loved her, even Elsie said so, so it must be true... She believed that Paul loved her too, but... </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Did you and Paul actually have a relationship that night?" For Eva, it didn't matter what Kate, as a mother, did for her son. She only cared about Paul. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elsie couldn't help but laugh at her words. "Ms. Miller, do you still have a trace of hope for Paul?" "Yes." Eva laughed along too, the warm sun shining on her face, making it bright. "I hope all of this is just fake, so..." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After pausing for a moment, Eva took a deep breath. "Can you give me a reasonable explanation like earlier?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elsie saw that Eva's eyes were red when she said this sentence, and she could imagine how upset she must be right now. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Elsie had a kind heart, she would surely sympathize with her, but unfortunately, she didn't. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As a woman like her, she didn't have sympathy, she only destroyed things she couldn't have at all costs. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Miller, think about it. What can a drunk man and a woman deeply in love with him do when they stay together for so long?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva's face, bathed in sunlight, gradually turned pale, and even the hand holding the voice recorder tightened. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Paul was never a faithful person, he..." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He said he will be faithful to me in the future." Elsie was interrupted firmly by Eva, and she curled her lips, sneering. "Is that so?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She looked mocking, as if she had heard a joke. "If he were faithful, he wouldn't have had a relationship with me, and he wouldn't have his mother solve the problem with me..." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After speaking, Elsie looked back at Eva, who was tightly holding the voice recorder. "If you're willing to forgive Paul for betraying you, then believe that he will be faithful to you in the future." Elsie left these words behind, put on her sunglasses again, and walked away. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at her retreating figure, Eva's eyelashes slowly lowered... </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't know how long she had been sitting on the bench until Zoey walked over, and she finally reacted. "Eva, you don't look good, is something wrong?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva shook her head, and seeing this, Zoey understood that she was feeling down and didn't ask any further. "Zoey, I need to make something for Ryan, can you take me back first?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although the hospital was close to their residence, she didn't have the strength to walk now. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sure, I'll go get the car." Eva nodded, and when Zoey drove the car to the hospital entrance, Eva bent down and got into the car. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She returned to her residence, made pumpkin porridge, had Zoey take her back, and sat down on the sofa herself. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She curled up, bent her legs, held her knees tightly with her hands, and rested her weak chin on her knees. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That's how she sat on the sofa, dazed, all night. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next day, when she got up, she suddenly felt dizzy. She thought it was because she had been overworked recently and didn't pay attention to the subtle changes in her body. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Supporting her tired body, she washed up as usual, made some breakfast, and carried it to the hospital. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ryan had breakfast, Zoey went to handle the discharge procedures, and Eva was busy packing up things in the hospital room. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She took out clothes from the cabinet, squatted to put them in the suitcase, quickly stood up, and grabbed the second piece. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But as she reached out, she suddenly felt dizzy, followed by darkness in front of her, her body went limp, and she fainted to the ground, unconscious. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ryan, who had just finished breakfast, heard a dull sound and suddenly turned around, only to see Eva fainting. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He turned pale with fright and quickly pressed the nearby emergency button. Doctors and nurses rushed in quickly. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Eva opened her eyes, she saw Ryan sitting in front of the hospital bed, staring at her with an indescribable look in his eyes. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ryan, what happened to me?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If she didn't remember wrongly, she should have collapsed from exhaustion due to not sleeping all night. But it was just a moment of dizziness, Ryan didn't need to look at her like that, right? </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ryan stared at Eva for a long time, hesitating, before calmly speaking. "Eva, you're pregnant." "What?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva, shocked like thunder out of a clear sky, suddenly sat up from the bed. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm pregnant?"</span></p></div>
