        <h1>Chapter 1989 When the First Snow Comes</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His research of robots couldn't be kept from Paul. Before he came, Paul was standing in front of the machine, constantly debugging its functions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Through the glass, James slowly smiled when he saw Paul quickly typing code, and the robot next to him, under his control, spoke like a real person.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Paul..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing James' voice, Paul stopped what he was doing, turned sideways and looked at his brother. In recent years, James had been enduring the pain and working day and night in order to develop this robot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul couldn't bear it, so he took the initiative to help him. Although his ability was far inferior to James', after his repeated efforts, the last step was finally completed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"James, when should we let him meet Amelia?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James pushed away Andrew's supporting hand, stood up straight, walked step by step to the robot, reached out to turn on the switch behind its head. When he saw that it spoke in the same tone as himself, he smiled again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This way, she won't feel lonely after I'm gone..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The chip developed by James was not meant to kill, but to record words, including the words of the next ten or twenty years.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Amelia wanted to hear all of what he said, she had to keep living, otherwise she wouldn't be able to hear it. James did this because he expected that Amelia would follow him, so he tied her up in this way to prevent her from doing stupid things.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was very grateful that this robot could be completely perfected before he died, so that he wouldn't have too many regrets. The only regret was that the time he spent with her was too short...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James' smile gradually faded as he thought of leaving Amelia. "Paul, bring the robot to her after I died. Also, please help Alexander manage the Evans Group..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing James' last words, Paul, a grown man, couldn't help but shed tears. "James, is there really nothing we can do?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James had consulted many famous doctors and even thought about head transplantation, but they were all impossible, so he no longer held hope. "I hope we can still be brothers in the next life."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not to mention Paul who couldn't hold tears, even Andrew outside the door had tears in his eyes and turned his back. No one could accept that James, who was less than fifty years old, would pass away like this. No one!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James, however, was calm. He raised his hand, placed it on Paul's shoulder, and patted it gently. "It will be Alexander's coming-of-age ceremony in two years, I will hold on until that day."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul lowered his eyelashes and sighed deeply, "James, if possible, I would like to sacrifice twenty years of my life so that you can stay with Amelia and Alexander until the age of seventy..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At least not until Alexander reached adulthood, but wait until Alexander got married and had children. Even if he couldn't see his grandchildren, at least not dying at such a young age...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But things always go against one's wishes. Even though Amelia prayed to God every day, even though Alexander practiced and researched the surgery countless times, even though Paul was willing to sacrifice twenty years of his life, what was supposed to happen still would happen...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That day, when the first snow fell and the sun was shining brightly, Amelia sat on the rattan swing, swinging slowly while looking at the figures of a big and a small man playing golf on the lawn...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eight years ago, Alexander was ten years old. At that time, James taught him how to use a knife. Alexander was not even as tall as his chest yet. Now, he is already as tall as James...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at the equally tall figure, Amelia would always think of James when he was young, and would marveled at how time flew. In the blink of an eye, Alexander was already eighteen years old. After his coming-of-age ceremony, he would be an adult.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man holding the golf club and trying hard to keep his body steady, although his posture was still as straight as before, he always felt a sense of fatigue due to that damn chip.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had been holding on for so many years because he couldn't bear to leave Amelia and he hadn't arranged everything yet. Now his son had successfully become the president of the Evans Group and was about to be crowned. No matter how tired James was, he now had a sense of relief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After James swung the club and scored, he asked Alexander who was standing next to him, "It's your turn... Also, where do you want to hold your coming-of-age ceremony?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander aimed at the hole, swung the club, then hit the hole with one shot before finally answering, "Wherever you want."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Over the past three years, Alexander had completely shed his former arrogance and had become extremely obedient. He was a very filial son, but James felt that he lacked a bit of courage and uprightness. "Sometimes, as the ruler of the Evans Group, you need to have a stronger opinion."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was not without courage. He just wanted to be a child protected by his father in the last time of James. "Just tell me where you want to go."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James, holding the golf club, slowly turned around and looked at Amelia, who was sitting on the swing with her long hair swaying in the wind. "Your mom has always wanted to go to a snow mountain. Why don't we hold the ceremony there..."</span></p></div>
