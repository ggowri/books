        <h1>Chapter 1791 The only chance to confess love</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at the despondent Amelia, Johnny remained silent for a long time, so long that Amelia thought he wouldn't respond. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There's nothing to be ashamed of, everyone has different perspectives and thoughts," he finally said. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Perhaps," Amelia agreed, her eyes shifting to the window, her face filled with sadness, which tugged at Johnny's heartstrings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Johnny didn't say anything more, he just sat quietly with her. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a while of silence, Amelia seemed to remember something and turned back to look at Johnny, who was sitting next to her. "You said something to me in lip language that day, but it was blocked by blood stains, I didn't see it," she said, holding the cup in her hand, looking at Johnny with a puzzled expression. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What did you say?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Johnny was taken aback, seemingly not expecting Amelia to remember, and he blushed slightly. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's nothing," he said. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia tilted her head slightly, looking at Johnny with a skeptical look. "You'd better tell me, otherwise I'll keep thinking about it." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Johnny could have confessed 'I like you' to Amelia, but he knew she would follow James if he reached out to her. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the face of such a life-and-death love, Johnny's feelings didn't really matter. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, it was better not to tell her, to avoid burdening her in the future. "I told you to remember to send the bonus to my house," he finally said. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought she would say something touching, but it turned out she was only concerned about the bonus. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you so short of money?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Johnny, with red eyes, nodded slightly. "Yes." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He missed his </span><span>only chance to confess love</span><span>. It would be false to say he didn't regret it, but their current distance was just right. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Johnny turned away from the light, and Amelia couldn't see the faint mist in his eyes. "Do you have paper and pen? I'll write down the address where Erebus will send the bonus, and you can go get it yourself." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No rush," Johnny replied, putting away all the complex emotions in his eyes, taking the cup from her hand. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He placed the cup back on the bedside table and then took a clean cup, poured some </span><span>warm water, and handed it to her. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Have some water first, I'll go inform the others." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When she heard that he was going to inform the others, Amelia quickly asked, "Do they all know I'm back?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They all know," Johnny replied. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are they okay?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Not very well." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before leaving, Amelia left a letter. On it, she wrote that she was going to find James and Zack, and asked Eva and Gigi not to worry. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But even James and Zack hadn't returned safely, so how could Eva and Gigi not worry? So, the two pregnant women, one in tears every day, the other hovering between madness and weeping. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only Paul, Peter, Andrew, along with Holden and Emelyn, were searching Erebus's location, but they had found nothing. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva was due to give birth in two or three months, and she was exhausted, but she was still holding on at the bedside, wanting to wait for Amelia to wake up. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul couldn't bear to see her like that, so he forcibly carried her back. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gigi also waited, wanting to ask Amelia if Zack was still alive, Johnny had told her that Zack was dead, but she didn't believe it and wanted to hear the answer from Amelia. After hearing Johnny's words, Amelia felt guilty. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's my fault that they're worried about me." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Johnny shook his head. "They'll understand you." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying that, Johnny helped Amelia lie down and covered her with a soft blanket. Amelia felt that he was right and obediently followed his advice, closing her eyes again. "When they come, remember to call me," she said. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay," Johnny replied, his voice unexpectedly gentle, even to himself. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stared at Amelia's sleeping face for a moment, then took out his phone. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He sent a message to the people below to order some light meals to be sent up, and then he informed the others. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the person who appeared in the ward was not Eva and the others, but Dylan from the Lawrence family. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Johnny's sharp eyebrows and eyes had a hint of hostility as he asked, "Who are you looking for?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dressed in a gray suit, exuding an air of nobility and elegance, Dylan raised his chin towards Amelia. "I'm here to see her."</span></p></div>
