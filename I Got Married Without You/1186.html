        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your father didn't know about the deal between Gloria and Clark's daughter. He thought we let her go and started treating Gloria kindly. Later, Gloria used some means to establish a relationship with your father. Not long after, she claimed to be pregnant."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span> "No one knows that Gloria, who claimed to be pregnant, started plotting from here. She pretended to be gentle and generous, and sent chicken soup to Clark's daughter every day. When she met your father, she didn't say anything, which was completely different from her previous quarrelsome, conflicting, and crazy behavior."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span> "This made your father feel more and more guilty towards her, and Clark's daughter also felt sorry for Gloria. Therefore, when Gloria proposed that Clark's daughter leave your father after the child was born, Clark's daughter agreed. Gloria promised that Clark's daughter would not be in danger and she would send her away."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span> "The two of them seemed to have become sisters, which confused me. Later, Clark's daughter's child was born, and Gloria bribed the doctor to tell your father that the child was stillborn. Your father was sad for a while because of this. Gloria promised Clark's daughter that she would reunite with the child after Clark's daughter left, as long as she didn't tell your father about the child."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"After having a child, Clark's focus was no longer entirely on your father. Coupled with moral constraints, she decided to leave your father and Gloria's marriage. After her body had recovered, the once committed Clark said some hurtful things to your father and did some things that made him give up on her completely. Your father </span><span>thought that Clark didn't want him and had betrayed him, so he let her go completely."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"However, Gloria did not keep her promise. On the way to take the first wife to see her child, Gloria strangled her with a rope. Your father didn't know and lived in the pain of being abandoned, drinking heavily every day. When you were about five years old, your father finally learned the truth and broke off his marriage with Gloria."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Gloria still didn't want to divorce your father, so she came to me and asked me to persuade him. I went to see him and said some unpleasant things. Your father became angry and we had a big argument. That night, after drinking heavily, your father set himself on fire. Your older brother was still in the room..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Gloria rushed in to save them, regardless of her own safety. Her face and body were burned, and her disabled legs were broken by the burning beams. She did everything she could to save your older brother, but couldn't save your father. He was completely buried in the fire..."</span></p></div>
