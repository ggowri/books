        <h1>Chapter 1641 Let Paul make the decision</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva mentioned Edith and Anthony, and Kate, who always maintained a gentle smile, looked slightly serious as if she had thought of something, and she let go of Eva's hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't blame me for being heartless. Which parent wouldn't worry about their own child? If you were born into a better family, had a higher education, and were more virtuous, how could I not accept you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kate had learned her lesson from Anthony and Edith's situation and didn't want to interfere in her son's affairs anymore. But from her perspective, Eva couldn't compare to even Anthony's pinky finger, yet she wanted to be her daughter-in-law. How could this work?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Miller, in fact, wealthy families really emphasize the match between social backgrounds. Because of the different upbringing, thoughts, vision, values, and knowledge, it's only the hormones that attract you to each other now. Once that passion fades, you'll realize the importance of differences."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Out of everything Kate said, this sentence hit Eva's self-esteem the hardest and left her unable to argue back. Eva clenched her fist, then slowly released it and looked up at Kate, her eyes showing a hint of exhaustion...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't speak, appearing hesitant and deep in thought. Kate couldn't see through her, so she continued:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Although James and Amelia are the best example of social mismatch, James is different from Paul. He can tolerate Amelia without limits, regardless of her own shortcomings or whatever mistakes she may make. I dare say that even if Amelia were to cheat one day, James would still love her. But Paul wouldn't."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He's still childish and immature. In his eyes, what he can't have is the best. Once he gets it, the novelty wears off. When that happens, think about what you'll do."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kate's words struck deep within Eva's soul, laying bare all her fears and making her feel tightness in her chest. It also made her waver, but she couldn't find any words to say in response...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Eva's hesitating expression, Kate knew her words had an effect. She let go of Eva's hand and reached for her expensive bag on the couch. She opened it and took out a black card, handing it to Eva.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's all I have to say. Go home and think carefully about whether you want to marry my son or not. If you choose not to, the card is yours. But if you still choose to marry him, be prepared for interference in your store and your future life. The decision is in your hands..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying this, Kate left, her elegant figure swaying and her footsteps light and graceful, but in Eva's eyes, it felt like a heavy mountain pressing down on her, making it hard for her to breathe...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feeling suffocated, she couldn't help but pick up the black card. The dim light imprinted on Eva's face, revealing a pale, bloodless complexion...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She sat in the caf&eacute; for a long time, finally putting the card back in her bag and getting up to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When she returned home, she filled the bathtub with water and relaxed her tense nerves as she lay in it. Her mind flashed with the image of Paul holding her in the bathtub...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Did Paul want to marry her out of responsibility for sleeping with her, or was it because of love? Why couldn't she differentiate anymore?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With her thoughts in disarray, Eva buried her head in the water, washing away her exhaustion and clearing her mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Regardless, she had to let Paul know about Kate's visit and let him make the decision himself. Whether Paul ultimately chose his mother or her, it was Paul's business.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he still insisted on marrying her after knowing about this, then she would go all out and seek his mother's approval. After all, asking for help wasn't a big deal. But if Paul chose his mother, then they would have no future...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was simple, no need to overthink.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After coming to this realization, Eva got up from the bathtub, dried her hair, and dived into the bed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a night of turmoil two nights ago and another night of turmoil last night, she was exhausted and quickly fell into a deep sleep.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next day, when Eva woke up, it was already evening, showing just how tired she was. She got up and freshened up, then picked up her phone and removed Paul from the blacklist. She called him, but he didn't answer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Glancing at the time, Eva thought Paul should be at home at this hour, so she got in the car and headed straight to Paul's villa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When she arrived, the butler said Paul had been busy lately and was staying in an apartment close to the company, not at the villa. He told Eva to go to the apartment area to find him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva could only turn the car around and drive towards the city center.</span></p></div>
