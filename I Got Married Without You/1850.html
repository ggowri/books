        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Dylan turned and walked out, his tall silhouette radiating strength and warmth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dylan, thank you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without looking back, Dylan raised a muscled arm in a casual wave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia watched him go, smiling slightly at the sight of the bag full of snacks he left behind. She wasn</span><span>'</span><span>t even hungry, but the gesture made her feel loved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A few seconds passed before Amelia left the command room and entered the control room where Matty was working at his console.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why are you here, Dylan? Shouldn't you be overseeing the central area?" Matty asked, not looking up from his work.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I thought you promised the </span><span>Moores</span><span> a way out?" Dylan asked, feigning nonchalance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matty paused, looking at Dylan, "Can't you see what I'm planning?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Of course</span><span> I can. But aren't you afraid Amelia will find out?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She'll figure it out eventually. But I have ways to assuage her suspicions."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But some truths can't stay hidden forever. What will you do when she finds out?" Dylan continued.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're here to persuade me, Dylan? Afraid of a few more lashes?" Matty retorted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I just don't want her to be your enemy when she learns the truth." Dylan replied calmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just keep your mouth shut, and she'll never know." Matty shot back coldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But you've restricted James's freedom, threatened to separate him from Amelia using their unborn child. James knows all this." Dylan countered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matty was about to reply when something caught his eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Out," he commanded, not to Dylan, but to Amelia, who he had detected lurking outside the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I had my suspicions about you restricting James, but I didn't expect your acting skills to be so good." Amelia admitted, stepping into the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now that you know, I have nothing to hide. Ask whatever you want." Matty responded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're using my child to threaten my husband to leave me. What kind of grandfather are you?" Amelia blurted out, her heart aching.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"James is the leader of S, my enemy, and therefore your enemy. I can't let you be together."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Other than blood, you're a stranger to me. Who are you to interfere in my life?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I am your grandfather. I have the right and the authority to interfere, just like I do with Dylan."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You raised Dylan, he respects you. But did you raise me? Did you feed me? Did you help me grow?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You've done nothing for me, yet you want to control me, to intimidate me, to drive away my husband. Who are you to do that?!" Amelia continued, her hand shaking with anger but her voice remained steady, "You're just a stranger. Who are you to do that?!"</span></p></div>
