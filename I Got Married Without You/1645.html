        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia quickly realized what was happening and called Eva.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva answered the phone, "Amelia, what's wrong?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Relieved to hear Eva's voice, Amelia asked, "Where are you, Eva?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva, wearing sunglasses, replied calmly, "I'm in Germany."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Huh?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Confused, Amelia asked, "Why did you suddenly go to Germany?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After hesitating for a moment, Eva finally told her, "Ryan just had surgery and needs someone to take care of him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Ryan was mentioned, Amelia's expression paused for a moment, but quickly returned to normal. "Is his surgery successful?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nodding, Eva replied, "The surgery went well, but we'll have to wait and see how he recovers. However, there's a good chance he'll be able to walk again."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Relieved to hear that Ryan has hope of walking again, Amelia sighed, "As long as he can walk, that's all that matters. When do you think he'll be able to come back home?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva replied, "He just finished the surgery, so it will take some time for him to recover. Probably about a month. Once he's recovered enough, he'll come back home for rehabilitation treatment."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After understanding the situation, Amelia brought up the topic of Paul, "Eva, did you reject Paul because his parents approached you privately?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Taking a deep breath, Eva said, "His mother was right. Paul and I are not suitable for each other."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Amelia was about to advise Eva, she was interrupted, "Amelia, it's impossible between Paul and me. Don't worry about him anymore."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying that, Eva looked into the distance and saw Zoey waving at her. She quickly waved back and then said to Amelia, "Zoey is here to pick me up. I have to go."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Amelia could finish her sentence, Eva hung up the phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking for a moment, Amelia called Paul to let him know that Eva was in Germany and not to worry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking that it was his own parents who caused Eva to leave the country overnight, </span><span>Paul slammed the accelerator and drove straight to his old house.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sitting in Zoey's car, Eva took off her sunglasses, revealing a pair of swollen, red eyes. Even though she was wearing colored contact lenses, the bloodshot veins in her eyes couldn't be hidden.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She turned her head and looked out of the car window at the blue sky and white clouds. The weather was nice, but she couldn't appreciate the beautiful scenery. Her mind was filled with the images from last night...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wondered, what's the difference between herself and Elsie?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She got drunk and slept with Paul, receiving a promise from him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He got drunk and slept with Elsie, also giving her a promise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In Paul's eyes, what was the difference between sleeping with her or sleeping with her? What was the difference between loving her or loving her? </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After thinking for a long time, Eva realized the only difference was that she knew how to set Paul free.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Someone like Paul, a playboy, was meant to roam freely without the constraints of marriage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for herself, after crying and seeing her tear-stained, distorted face in the mirror, she felt ugly, like an abandoned woman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had always been afraid of becoming like this since she started following Paul. But when her fears became a reality, she had no choice but to accept it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, she couldn't understand why, even though she only gave 50% of her love, she still felt so heartbroken that she had to escape to numb herself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unable to figure it out, Eva comforted herself, it's okay. After hiding for a month, she would be able to let go of him and move on, no longer going back and forth.</span></p></div>
