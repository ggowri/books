        <h1>Chapter 1828 Matty punished Dylan</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dylan didn't explain or plead, he directly walked to the middle of the study, turned his back to Matty, took off his coat, and knelt straight down. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matty, holding a riding crop, got up from the sofa and without even blinking, lashed Dylan's back with over twenty strokes. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The wounds on his back, large and small, burst open, and fresh red blood gushed out, causing excruciating pain, but Dylan didn't make a sound. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After the beating, Matty threw the riding crop aside and coldly stared at Dylan. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't want you to reveal to Amelia about the chip in James' brain or the injuries he's sustained. Otherwise, next time it won't be just twenty lashes." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Enduring the pain, Dylan put on his clothes, turned around, and with a pale face, nodded at Matty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You can rest </span><span>assured,</span><span> I won't meddle in the next steps." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had already betrayed his grandfather once, and he couldn't do it again. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After dealing with Dylan, Matty got up from the sofa. "Now, let's go to Erebus. You must be back before 6 am tomorrow. You go and make the arrangements." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Dylan agreed, he opened the study door and saw Amelia waiting outside. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He quickly wiped the sweat from his forehead before she noticed him. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The study had good soundproofing, and Amelia didn't hear what the grandfather and grandson had discussed inside. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Besides, there were two bodyguards outside the study, so she couldn't approach. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When she saw Dylan coming out, she hurriedly asked if Matty had given him a hard time. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dylan smiled and said that his grandfather wouldn't do anything to him, and she shouldn't worry too much. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia wanted to ask more, but Dylan interrupted her, saying, "My mother isn't feeling well, I need to go back and check on her." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing his urgency, she nodded, "Then go back quickly. If Matty gives you a hard time, remember to tell me, I'll go and reprimand him." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, Dylan couldn't help but smile. If twenty lashes could earn him his sister's trust and protection, it was worth it. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After arranging everything, Dylan left with Matty from the backyard. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A group of people dressed in black and wearing masks quickly arrived at Erebus. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the biochemistry area, numerous transparent glass chambers were arranged in rows on the ground. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking down from above, one could see the bodies lying inside each chamber. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These bodies couldn't exactly be called corpses, as they were being used as biological specimens. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each specimen had the letter "S" carved on its forehead. All the bodies inside were members of S. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking from the entrance, one couldn't see the end of the row of glass chambers. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In these chambers, there was a tall man sitting on the floor, one knee bent, his long and elegant hand resting on his knee... </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Following those well-defined fingers, he looked up slowly, revealing a face with sharp angles and extraordinary beauty. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, that face showed no emotion, only a deep, desolate emptiness in his eyes. That despair came from the loss of his wife and from the sight of the biological specimens in front of him... </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All these biological specimens were people he knew. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was forced to watch them slowly succumb to bacterial infections and turn into corpses, unable to do anything. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had thought about following them, but the deep-seated hatred in his bones always woke him up on countless cold nights, urging him to persevere. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was like a walking corpse, giving up several times, only to survive the infections... It turned out that surviving was the right choice. At least tonight, he was finally meeting the person he wanted to take revenge on. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The electronic sound of the authorization being lifted echoed in the biochemistry area, and the heavy door opened from both sides. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James, leaning against the wall after receiving medical treatment, had changed into clean clothes and cleaned his wounds. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't show any emotions and gazed up at Matty, who was standing high above him. Matty, wearing a full-face mask and protective suit, looked down at James with his hands behind his back, taking slow steps towards him. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Let's make a deal</span><span>. I'll give you information about Amelia in exchange for a promise from you."</span></p></div>
