        <h1>Chapter 1823 Sophia was killed by S</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They clearly knew that she had been to Erebus and what she had experienced inside, yet they could still deceive her as if nothing had happened. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They even lied to her, claiming that she had impersonated Skender, and it was only after they discovered her resemblance to Sophia through Erebus surveillance footage that they came to find her for the family reunion. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How could they deceive and conceal the truth from her and still have the audacity to come and seek her for the family reunion? </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And... James had been separated from her for half a year in order to investigate the founder of Erebus, and Zack had even died inside because of this mission. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were doing such outrageous things behind her back, and yet they came to find her for the family reunion. How was she supposed to face Gigi in the future? </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia held the gold leaf in her hand, and the emotions surging in her heart were nothing but disappointment and anger. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She suppressed her anger and contemplated what to do when footsteps were heard outside the door, followed by the opening of the study door from the outside. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matty, dressed in a white suit, had already guessed that she had come to the study when he couldn't find her downstairs, but he didn't expect her to be here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matty sighed deeply in his heart, but his face remained unchanged as he walked up to Amelia, reaching out to take the glittering gold leaf from her hand. "Since you've discovered it, I won't try to deny it," he said. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Taking the gold leaf, he turned and walked to the desk, sitting down naturally. "But I want to make it clear that I only found out about your existence after you left Erebus, and what your husband and you experienced inside cannot be attributed to me." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His implication was that he had created Erebus as his own business, and it had nothing to do with Amelia. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Therefore, he didn't feel guilty because he didn't know about Amelia's existence at that time, and if he had known, he wouldn't have let her go. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But it was only after Amelia left that he discovered her existence, and in order to facilitate her family reunion, he chose to deceive and conceal the truth. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After understanding this, Amelia steadied her emotions and walked up to Matty, sitting on the sofa opposite the desk, facing him. "Even if that's what you say, you shouldn't have let Dylan come and deceive me," she said. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matty looked at Amelia with the eyes of a child, watching her with a pure gaze. "Child, what I did was not a good thing. How could I possibly show you such a dark side and let you see it?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Moreover, your friend had an accident inside, and if I hadn't deceived you and kept it from you, how could you have agreed to come back and recognize me?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing such self-righteous words, Amelia couldn't help but sneer. "Do you think that by deceiving me into recognizing you on the family tree, I will accept you?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matty could see the vigilance in Amelia's clear eyes, a vigilance reserved for dealing with bad people. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The current Amelia clearly regarded Matty as a demon from hell and would certainly not be willing to recognize him. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matty's eyes darkened for a moment, not blaming Amelia, but rather blaming Dylan for ruining his good intentions. "Amelia, I'm sorry. You've just returned to the Lawrence family, and I've let you know that I'm not a good person, leaving you with a bad impression. It's my fault, but..." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a pause, Matty took out a photo from the drawer and placed it on the table, slowly pushing it towards Amelia. "Do you know how your grandmother died?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia didn't speak, just stared coldly at Matty, contemplating how to contact James and let him know who the founder of Erebus was. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She was killed by the S organization," Matty said, not knowing what Amelia was thinking, and continued to recount the past. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this point, Matty's eyes turned bloodshot, and Amelia was somewhat shocked, raising her eyes. Had her grandmother been killed by S? </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"At that time, I made a vow to kill all the members of S, no matter how they changed their names, I wouldn't let a single one go, until they were all dead." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matty's hands, placed on the table, suddenly clenched into fists. "I know this is extreme, but Amelia, I haven't been normal since your grandmother's death. I can only live on this hatred." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After he finished speaking, it seemed as if he had torn off the mask of pretense, and </span><span>the kindness in his eyes disappeared, leaving only darkness and horror. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I created Erebus to invite gamblers to play a game of life and death, in order to test Erebus's program with human lives, so that when we find the members of S, we can better torture and kill them."</span></p></div>
