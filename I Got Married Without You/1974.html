        <h1>Chapter 1974 Amelia Got Tied Up</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that instant, Alexander suddenly saw a radiant glow emanating from James. It was a saint-like brilliance that made him realize James was quite formidable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Crushed in one fell swoop, Alexander hung his head low in James' embrace and admitted defeat. "If you teach me everything you know, I will truly respect you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James, having lived longer than Alexander, used his extra years of knowledge to gain the upper hand over him. He realized that Alexander was trying to learn the ropes and then turned the tables on him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But all he could offer was an apology. From the moment he decided to subdue Alexander, Alexander's chances of turning the tables were gone forever.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James set Alexander down and tapped the computer. "This program contains the world's most challenging IQ puzzles. Solve all these, and then I'll teach you more."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, James walked away. Alexander hurried after him, asking, "Is there anything else you can do besides solving puzzles?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James stopped, looked down from his superior height at Alexander, who was tilting his head up to look at him, and said, "You'll find out in the future."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Alexander truly didn't understand what else James could do.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Having seen James' skills in gambling, shooting, knife-handling, computing, AI development, and management firsthand in the future, he truly understood just how formidable James was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, his only desire was to solve every puzzle in the program, then turn the tables on James and reclaim his authority!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While Alexander was too engrossed in his work to eat or drink, James leaned against the bathroom door, waiting for Amelia to finish showering. As soon as she emerged, he grabbed her wrist and pulled her into his embrace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia jumped, startled. "What are you doing here instead of having your dinner?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James, holding her waist with one hand and lifting her toward his chest, replied, "The hunger isn't in my stomach."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A wet Amelia glanced sideways at him. "Let's not. If Alexander can't find me, he'll come knocking soon."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though James would initiate intimacy every night, their moments were often interrupted by Alexander's sudden knocks at the door. At such times, Amelia would push him away and leave the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In fact, Amelia somewhat appreciated these interruptions because James, in his thirties, was even more vigorous than he had been in his twenties.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They said women in their thirties had heightened desires, but with James around, her desires were not only amplified. She was satisfied to the fullest before they could even fully emerge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, overwhelmed, Amelia would seize any chance to escape, pretending to be reluctant and secretly relieved whenever Alexander feigned some discomfort.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James was well aware of Amelia's little schemes and Alexander's tactics, yet he never exposed their subtle understanding, simply scooping up Amelia and heading to their room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He placed her in front of the vanity, picked up a hairdryer, turned on the warm air, and began drying her hair. He said, "He won't interrupt us anymore."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite the loud noise of the hairdryer, Amelia heard James' words and felt a pang of regret. "Why?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James turned off the hairdryer, leaned in, and nibbled on Amelia's earlobe. "Indulging the child for five years led to him becoming spoiled. It's time to make amends."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To Amelia, it sounded more like punishment than amends. She asked worriedly, "Did you hit him again this afternoon in the study?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James, who was about to resume drying her hair, raised an eyebrow slightly. "I'm not sick enough to only know how to hit the child, am I?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Through the vanity mirror, Amelia stared at the reflection of the man behind her. "Are you planning to discipline him yourself from now on?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James nodded but didn't divulge how he would discipline him, simply turning the hairdryer back on to continue drying her hair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For the past five years, Amelia hadn't dried her hair herself. It had always been James who did it, along with tasks like soaking her feet and kneading her back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He pampered and loved her, always actively showing it, which moved Amelia deeply. She always cherished and reciprocated his love with the same affection, like massaging his legs or his temples.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their marriage was full of love. They never argued or fought, except for the occasional snide remarks when Johnny visited. Mostly, James treated her like a treasure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a smile reflected in the mirror, Amelia teased James, "Honey, you're so handsome. Even when you're old and grey, you'll still be a handsome old man."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James looked up with starry eyes at Amelia in the mirror. "When we're that old, I might not be as good in certain aspects. Don't blame me then."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia was speechless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could turn anything into that topic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Besides...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"At that age, how could anyone still be up for it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's why we need to make the most of now," James replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He turned off the hairdryer and reached for a black tie he had placed nearby at some point.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia was puzzled as to what James needed the tie for, only to see him grab her wrists, wrap the tie around them behind the chair, and secure them together.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why are you tying me up?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Faced with Amelia's confusion, James did not respond immediately, instead lifting her along with the chair and moving towards the floor-to-ceiling window...</span></p></div>
