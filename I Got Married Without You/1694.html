        <h1>Chapter 1674 The public opinion online</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Netizens never expected that Paul, known as a playboy, would spend such a long time chasing women. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone couldn't believe it and thought Paul's words were unreliable. However, his final statement, "spending a lifetime pursuing one person," was quite shocking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After finishing reading the news, Daniel was incredibly shocked. He stared at the glamorous Eva on the screen, thinking he must have made a mistake. He desperately rubbed his eyes and stared at Eva, carefully examining her features. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only then did he dare to confirm that his ex-wife had indeed married into the wealthy Evans Family, a family as rich as a country!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daniel could hardly believe it. After the divorce, he had been living a miserable life, burdened with debts and constantly being chased by creditors. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On top of that, he had to take care of his wife and children, not even having five minutes of rest each day. He was exhausted and worn out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Eva was flourishing. Not only did she open a nightclub, but she also made a fortune from it. And now, she had become a high-class lady in a wealthy family. How could Daniel accept this?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He angrily vented his frustrations online, accusing Eva of marrying into wealth and abandoning her ex-husband. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He even claimed that she had been involved with Paul during their marriage. Surprisingly, some netizens believed him and started asking what happened. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finding some solace online, Daniel began spreading malicious rumors about Eva using the most vicious words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as he was getting carried away, he saw someone posting that he was spreading lies and that he was the one who had cheated and deceived others. They accused him of marrying for money, housing, and financial gain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daniel was about to respond with words when a piece of solid evidence, like a pair of iron hammers, appeared online and instantly became a hot topic. Not long after, his post was drowned in a flood of criticism.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, public opinion online started to view Eva as an independent and strong-willed girl. They sympathized with her for being deceived by her ex-husband but admired her hard work and success. Although she couldn't compare to the wealthy family, she had earned her own money and would never have to worry about her livelihood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony, who was manipulating everything behind the scenes, put down his phone after seeing the change in public sentiment. He turned around and looked at Paul, who was standing on the deck admiring the sea with Eva. Paul also glanced back at him, and the two friends exchanged a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The wedding was over, but the cruise ship continued sailing. The older generation gathered on the second floor, eating and chatting, while the younger ones gathered on the top floor to play games.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This suggestion came from Herb, who said that James had previously lost to him in a motorcycle race, so this time, no matter what, they had to win it back. He gathered a few young people and went upstairs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul and Eva called Anthony, along with their brothers and Edith. Edith was worried that Ryan would feel depressed if he was left alone, so she pushed him to go upstairs as well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Therefore, on the open-air deck of the top floor, a group of familiar but not-so-familiar people sat in the sofa area, staring at James, who was sitting in the main seat, with wide eyes...</span></p></div>
