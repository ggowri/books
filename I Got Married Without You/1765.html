        <h1>Chapter 1765 Only death can separate us</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia smirked, unable to hold back her laughter. "So, what's the reason? There must be a reason for breaking your promise, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emily held onto James' arm, resting her head on his shoulder. "Can't you see? He's with me now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia scoffed, "If he despises you so much, why would he be with you? If you want to kill me, just do it, don't disgust him here, and don't disgust me either."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emily, unfazed by her words, raised her fair hand and touched her own belly. "He used to despise me, but didn't he say that things are different now? I'm carrying his child, so he should take some responsibility, shouldn't he?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia's body, which she had been holding up, instantly stiffened. Her disbelieving gaze moved slowly from Emily's smug face to James' face. "As long as you say it's not true, I'll believe you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James, in pain and sweating, listened to the ticking countdown in his mind. He looked past her face and saw the red sniper's line behind her head. He was good at controlling his emotions, and after a moment, the hint of reluctance in his eyes disappeared, </span><span>replaced by an even more terrifying, icy demeanor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Got drunk, made a mistake," he replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This answer sent Amelia into a hellish abyss. She tried to climb out, but countless hands grabbed her feet, pulling her into an endless darkness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, she couldn't see or hear anything, only the rhythmic sound of her own heartbeat. Her heart was still beating, which explained the pain she felt, as if it had been torn in half, bleeding and exposed to the scorching sun, burning and searing. Amelia cried uncontrollably.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, you want to divorce me not because of unavoidable reasons, but because you made a mistake and got another woman pregnant, James..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia smirked bitterly, her eyes filled with tears, as she looked at James. She wanted to see his reaction, but he remained indifferent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had once fantasized that when James found out she was pregnant, he would be overjoyed and lift her up, but that scene never materialized. Instead, there was only indifference and detachment in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His cold gaze was no different from the day he had abandoned her with a piece of paper. Amelia understood that once again, because of Emily, he chose to abandon her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a bitter smirk, Amelia slowly picked up the divorce agreement and opened the first page, staring at the names of the two people. She suddenly remembered the marriage agreement they had signed in Ireland.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was a memorable passage: "Today, February 14th, Valentine's Day, groom James, bride Amelia, married for a hundred years, only death can separate us."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Having engraved this vow in her mind, Amelia silently smirked again, "It's not even a hundred years, and the groom has already broken his promise."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This statement made James freeze, and he instinctively pushed Emily away, wanting to grab Amelia's hand. However, Emily raised her hand towards the direction of the sniper rifle, and numerous red dots immediately appeared on the back of Amelia's head. James slowly lowered his hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia, focused on the agreement, did not see the actions between the two, but she flipped through the pages, seemingly giving James a chance to stop her. However, as she didn't hear him speak, she knew she wouldn't get a response.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She quickly turned to the last page, wiped away all her tears, and looked at James. "One last question, did you touch her because you were drunk, or because you loved her?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before James could respond, Emily answered on his behalf, "It started with being drunk, but later it happened a few more times, that was definitely because of love..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia only looked at James. "Is that what she said?"</span></p></div>
