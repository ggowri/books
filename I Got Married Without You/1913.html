        <h1>Chapter 1913 Amelia ran away</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two nurses preparing surgical tools inside turned around and realized Amelia was missing. One of them got scared and went after her, while the other called Dr. Gilbert.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dr. Gilbert, who answered the phone, was momentarily surprised, then quickly went to knock on the changing room door: "Mr. Evans, something's wrong. Mrs. Evans suddenly ran out of the operating room..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James, who had just changed into sterile clothing, froze for a moment, then quickly opened the door to the changing room.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Like a gust of wind, he ran at an incredibly fast speed to find Amelia.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia, being chased by the nurse, stumbled as she ran and accidentally bumped into someone...</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man she bumped into raised his hand to steady her, then lowered his cold, piercing eyes, staring at Amelia who turned around in confusion. "What are you running from?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Realizing it was Johnny she bumped into, Amelia quickly apologized and tried to move past him to continue running.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Johnny grabbed her hand and pulled her back. "Who are you hiding from?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia turned her head and saw the nurse running towards her through the corridor.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She quickly tried to shake off Johnny's grip, but he held on tightly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feeling desperate, she was about to curse at him when Johnny bypassed the crowd and looked at the approaching nurse.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't know what's going on, but that nurse is definitely coming for you. Do you want me to help?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia hesitated for a moment, then nodded.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought Johnny was going to help stop the nurse, but instead, he suddenly bent down and scooped her up in his arms.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He then turned around and quickly walked towards the hospital exit.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By the time the nurse caught up, Amelia had already been placed inside the car. She didn't have time to think about anything else and quickly fastened her seatbelt. As she glanced out the car window, she caught a glimpse of James standing on the steps at the hospital entrance.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before she could say anything, the car started moving.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia hurriedly leaned against the car window, wanting to say something, but James' despairing eyes pierced through her, reminding her that she had escaped right before the surgery. He must hate her now...</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Johnny also saw James, who was still wearing sterile clothing, indicating that he was going to accompany someone in the operating room.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia was also wearing surgical attire, clearly indicating that she was going to have surgery.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she was only seven months pregnant, not yet at the time for delivery. Why did she need surgery?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Johnny changed lanes and glanced at Amelia. "What kind of game are you and your husband playing? Why are you both running around in surgical attire?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia, feeling guilty, touched her belly and spoke softly, "The doctor said I had a heart transplant and developed sudden pregnancy-induced hypertension. They recommended a timely cesarean section, but I can't bear to lose my child, so..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Johnny didn't have a clear understanding of these diseases, so he asked, "What will happen if you don't have a cesarean section?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia remained silent for a moment before replying, "Without a cesarean section, my chances of survival are only 10%. With a cesarean section, it's 30%."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, Johnny's nonchalant expression suddenly turned serious. "So, whether you have a cesarean section or not, your chances of survival are slim, it's just that with the surgery, the chances are slightly higher?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia nodded lightly and didn't say anything more. Johnny suddenly slowed down and pulled over to the side of the road.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia wanted to ask why he stopped, but Johnny spoke first, "Amelia, James made the right choice. Listen to him."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia's eyes were filled with reluctance. "Of course, I know he made the right choice, but what about the child? The doctors evaluated my condition, and in order to save me, they can't consider the baby. But how can I bear to let go?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Johnny lowered his gaze and looked at her swollen belly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since he found out about her pregnancy, he had been by her side, watching her belly grow.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even he couldn't bear it. But compared to Amelia's life, this child seemed insignificant.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He believed James thought the same way. However, only the pregnant woman was connected to the life of the child.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only the pregnant woman could truly understand how important the child was. The feelings of men like them were relatively insignificant.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was only natural for a pregnant woman to be more reluctant than a father. But...</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Johnny stared at Amelia's gentle and serene profile, feeling a slight pang in his heart.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He quickly controlled his emotions and comforted Amelia, "Since your current condition doesn't allow you to have a child, then focus on staying alive for now. Once your health is restored, you can try again."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia smiled silently, her lips curling up. "If my body allowed me to have another child, the doctors would have told me. Obviously, it's not possible, that's why they don't talk about it."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Johnny didn't know what to say for a moment and fell silent.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The atmosphere inside the car became heavy, and even the sound of a dropped needle could be heard.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as the two of them sat in silence, two columns of black cars surrounded Johnny's car from both sides, trapping it in the middle.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The leader of the convoy, driving a Bugatti, turned sharply, skidded, and came to a sudden stop in front of Johnny's car.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After blocking all the routes in front, behind, and on the sides of Johnny's car, the man gripping the steering wheel opened the door and walked out with a cold expression.</span></p></div>
