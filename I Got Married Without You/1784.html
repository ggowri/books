        <h1>Chapter 1784 1-1 saw a familiar face</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The despair and indifference in his eyes were incomprehensible to 1-1.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What grudge do you have with Emily?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>1-1 received a call from Nick and rushed over without stopping, not yet having had a chance to review the surveillance footage, and was unclear about the situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She killed my wife."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's quite serious."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing James' cigarette, about to extinguish, 1-1 opened his cigarette case, took one out, and tossed it to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's talk conditions. You reveal the identity of the S founders, and I'll help you find the Moore father and daughter."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Taking the cigarette and fiddling with it in his hand, the man paused slightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you don't even know the identity of the S founders, why are you carrying out large-scale massacres of S members?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He killed my wife."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This ambiguous statement caused James to furrow his brow slightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It can't be that every S member killed your wife, can it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>1-1's massacres were not of a single S member, but of all of them, which didn't make sense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't know which member killed my wife, so I have to kill them all."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After 1-1 casually finished speaking, he turned his head to look at the black-clothed men waiting outside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Their families have also been massacred by S members. We're just seeking revenge together. Is there anything wrong with that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This made James' brow furrow even more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he took over S, it was Master Davies who managed it. James didn't know who Master Davies' people had massacred before, but he remembered the blood on his own hands. It was because S members had previously massacred others that 1-1, as well as Nick, Carson, and others, had united to retaliate against S.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Was this the law of cause and effect?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But... the people they eliminated were all malignant figures in the business world. Their hands were no less stained with blood than theirs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How about it, do we have a deal?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"When I've avenged my wife, I'll consider your offer."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since they were here for revenge, they could do whatever they wanted to him. He just had to personally kill Emily, otherwise he couldn't die in peace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you don't agree, then I can't fulfill your wish."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>1-1 stood up, hands in his pockets, looking down at James.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Evans, I admire your courage. Go with 1-3."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James quickly raised the gun in his hand and fired at 1-1, but 1-3's movements were faster. In the instant he drew his gun, he had already aimed his gun at James' forehead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Evans, he was trained in the midst of gunfire since he was a child. You can't outmatch his marksmanship. Just behave yourself."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After 1-1's calm statement, he reached out with his gloved hand and took the gun </span><span>from James.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Please."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>1-1's actions were respectful, showing no disdain for James' intentions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After 1-3 took James away, 1-1 stepped into the monitoring room and pulled up the surveillance footage from the lower area.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had only wanted to know what had happened during this time, but he hadn't expected to see a familiar face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As if afraid of not seeing clearly or making a mistake, 1-1 quickly lifted his trembling hands and removed his mask.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once his vision was clear, 1-1 dared to confirm that the face was as familiar as he remembered, unforgettable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>1-1 was somewhat excited as he reached out to touch the screen, his fingers trembling as they touched her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's really her..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tears welled up in 1-1's eyes. After staring at the screen for a while, he shook his head gently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She's too young, it's not her..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And she had died a long time ago.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The person on the screen was just someone who looked exactly like her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But... they really looked alike.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Almost enough to make him mistake her for the real thing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As 1-1 gradually wiped away the tears in his eyes, he stared quietly at the person on the screen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He learned that she was James' wife.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James had taken a risk to keep his wife out of danger. However, after Emily and Mr. Ben controlled James, he had no choice but to divorce his wife. But Emily didn't keep her word and sent Brandon to kill her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing the footage of Amelia sinking into the sea that Emily threw to James, 1-1's expression also darkened. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had just seen someone who looked exactly like her, and before he could confirm whether the person was related to her by blood, they were killed? </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>1-1 slumped onto the sofa, propping his chin up with one hand, his eyes gleaming with a cold light, filled with an impulse to tear Emily apart.</span></p></div>
