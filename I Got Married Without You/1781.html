        <h1>Chapter 1781 Karma</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James was desperately pounding on the cabin door, cursing at 1-2, but James just looked at him expressionlessly. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After the machine released his head, James turned around. He walked towards the room where the chips were stored, randomly picked one, and returned to the operating cabin to take the surgical knife handed to him. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He then put on gloves and sat down slowly behind 1-2, who was still cursing at him, and slowly removed his full-face headgear. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that moment, James finally saw 1-2's true face, a possibility he had never considered - it was Nick Simmons, Jessica Simmons' father.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"When you opened my head, tell me, which member of S sent my daughter to Myanmar!" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nick received the news of Jessica's death in Myanmar while dealing with Erebus, and he rushed to Myanmar to find his daughter dead. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was his only daughter, and she died inexplicably at the hands of S. He hated S, and when Emily told him that James was the leader of S, he wanted to tear James apart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My daughter was a doctor, but her fingers were broken and she died in Myanmar. Tell me, who did it." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James hesitated for a moment, as Nick's words made him think about karma. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Jessica was sent to Myanmar by Emelyn, her death was also closely related to him. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hesitated for a moment, then picked up the surgical knife and cut open Nick's head. He was unconscious for over ten days, and it wasn't until Amelia arrived that he regained consciousness. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Opening the skull without anesthesia was unbearable, and James could endure it, but 1-2 couldn't.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"James, you will die a terrible death!" 1-2 had always been the one cutting into others' brains, and no one dared to cut into his brain until James. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he recovered, he would definitely sacrifice James' head. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James had no reaction, and he cut open 1-2's head, wiped the flowing blood with a tissue, picked up the chip and placed it in Nick's brain, then sewed up the wound like a doctor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After completing all this, James went to the operating table, opened the code he had written in the Venom program room, linked it to his chip program, and then activated the chip installed in Nick. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After binding the programs of the two chips together, he took out a controller and turned to face Nick.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, the main program is in my hands. If I die, you will die too. So, from now on, you have to listen to me." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nick was in pain, sweating profusely, but he gritted his teeth and didn't make a sound. James didn't care about his resilience, instead, he stood in front of him, commanding him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Within a day, I want to see the Moore father and daughter. Have your people search for them, or I will make your life a living hell."</span></p></div>
