        <h1>Chapter 1933 Commit suicide to apologize</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia didn't respond to Eva's words.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead, she struggled to extend her hand and said, "Since I took the risk to give birth to this child, can I hold him?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though Amelia had lost a chunk of her memories and everything seemed unfamiliar to her, there was a natural instinct to feel close to her own child.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span> She naturally wanted to hold him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva placed the baby on the bed while holding him and said, "With your current condition, I can't let you hold the baby. I'll put him next to you, and you can touch him."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia finally got a clear view of what the baby looked like.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had fair and tender skin, chubby little cheeks, and a pair of blue eyes beneath undeveloped eyebrows and eyelashes. They were like melting snow in winter, warm and comforting.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For some reason, when she thought of these adjectives, she had a sense of familiarity, as if she had experienced it before or had imagined her own child looking like this. It felt incredibly familiar.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After staring at the baby for a while, Amelia hesitantly withdrew her fingers from touching him, feeling a bit scared.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She said, "Eva, my memories only include all of you, but not the baby. I don't know how to accept these missing memories..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was something that a person with amnesia had to go through.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just like Ryan back then, he was scared and didn't know what to do when faced with their arrival and pressure. He could only send security guards to drive them away.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva understood Amelia's feelings. "If you don't know how to accept it, then don't force yourself. Treat it as a story for now. When you eventually get used to James and the baby's presence, then you can accept these memories..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She followed the doctor's advice and chose to take it step by step.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't rush Amelia like they did with Ryan before. Instead, she comforted her and allowed her to take her time.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia felt relieved hearing these words, and she attempted to touch the baby's face again. "He's very beautiful and adorable."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span> Eva handed the bottle to the nanny behind her and smiled, "He's quite mischievous. He always fusses when the housekeepers hold him. He insists on being held by me, and only then he stops crying. When I get tired and want to take a break, he starts crying again..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva casually adjusted the baby's pants and noticed Amelia's skilled movement. She knew that Eva had put in a lot of effort and couldn't help but say, "Eva, thank you for taking care of the baby for me..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva finished adjusting the baby's clothes and looked at Amelia with gratitude in her eyes. "I'm your sister, and he's your child. If I don't take care of him, who will? Besides, I have my own child to take care of, so it's convenient for me to take care of both of them."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia heard that Eva had her own child and filled in another memory gap. "So, did you... eventually marry Daniel, or..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't know anything now and didn't dare to say anything without certainty. She could only ask uncertainly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Being without memories made her cautious, but Eva didn't mind.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Speaking of that, my relationship with Paul was quite a long story..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia tilted her head slightly and looked at Eva with a meaningful smile. "So... the father of your child is Paul, not Daniel..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva asked curiously, "According to your memories before the age of eighteen, you should have approved of Daniel. Why don't you find it strange that I married someone else?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia smiled and pursed her lips. "To be honest, even though Daniel seemed upright, I had a bad feeling about him. I always felt that he would cheat on you and betray you. So, I'm actually quite happy that you didn't marry him."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva was taken aback for a moment but then smirked.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You were right. Daniel did betray me. Well, actually, he was after my money from the beginning."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the floodgates of their past conversations opened, Eva couldn't stop talking, and Amelia was happy to listen to Eva's stories and complaints about Daniel, as well as how she eventually got together with Paul.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After their chat about the past, Eva added, "In the past six months, James has been praying and seeking help from various gods and deities for you. His knees are worn out because of you..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before she could finish her sentence, there was a knock on the door outside the hospital room.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva paused and asked loudly, "Who is it?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matty remained silent for two seconds before pushing the door open. "It's me." Seeing Amelia's grandfather, Eva trembled in fear. "What... what are you here for?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Eva didn't know what kind of person Matty was or that he was the one who implanted the chip in James' brain, she wouldn't have been so wary of him, considering he was Amelia's grandfather.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, he had saved Amelia's life. But now, with James' life in his hands, Eva couldn't help but feel fearful of this ruthless person...</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matty glanced at the woman guarding Amelia and didn't take her seriously. "I heard that my granddaughter lost her memory, so I came to see if I can help her recover it."</span></p></div>
