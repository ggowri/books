        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I have nothing to do with him," Amelia panicked in her heart but remained composed. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why are you asking me this?" Dylan said bluntly, "I suspect you are Mr. Evans' secret wife." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia wouldn't tell him. "If I were his wife, would I still need to come out and do these projects?" Dylan laughed along and didn't question further. "I just thought the back view looked somewhat similar, so I was curious. Please don't mind." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia remained unfazed and smiled back, "It's okay." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dylan extended his hand in a gesture of invitation. "Let me see you out." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia nodded, "Okay." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Dylan saw them off, he furrowed his brows and returned to the study. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He saw Matty holding a photo, caressing it lovingly with his fingers. "Grandfather." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dylan walked over. "Is Miss Clark the person you were looking for?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matty's gaze never left the photo. "She does resemble her a bit, but I'm not certain." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dylan asked, "Then why don't you keep her hair and do a DNA test?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matty sighed deeply. "Sophia only gave birth to two children, your father and your uncle. There couldn't be any other children." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dylan furrowed his brows, "Then why does Miss Clark's mother, Sumasa, look so much like Sophia?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matty was also puzzled, "Maybe they just look alike?" Skender, who came today, resembled Sophia somewhat, but the way she spoke and behaved were different from Sophia. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matty had a glimmer of hope before meeting Skender, thinking that perhaps Sophia had given birth to triplets. But after seeing Skender, that idea wasn't as strong. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There are many people in the world who resemble each other; suspicions of blood relations shouldn't be solely based on resemblance. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dylan saw that his grandfather was no longer insisting on this matter, so he didn't say anything more. "Grandfather, are you going back home for dinner tonight?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every year at this time, Matty would gather with his family, no matter how busy everyone was, they all had to rush back. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Originally, Matty wanted to invite Skender to join them for dinner, but she declined, and Matty lost interest. "I won't go today." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dylan was taken aback. How come his grandfather's mood seemed even lower after meeting Skender? Was his expectation disappointed? "Well, grandfather, take care at home. I'll come to see you in a few days." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matty put down the photo, opened a drawer, and took out something, handing it to Dylan. "There are some things to investigate, so do it quickly and don't waste time." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dylan reached out his hands respectfully and accepted it. "The things that need to be taken care of are almost done. I'll make sure to work harder these next few days and not let you down." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmm." Matty let out a deep, intimidating voice from his throat, causing Dylan to instinctively lower his head. "Grandfather, I'll go back first." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matty raised his hand and waved. Only then did Dylan breathe a sigh of relief and quickly leave the study. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When his grandfather talked about serious matters, it was always terrifying.</span></p></div>
