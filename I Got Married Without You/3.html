        <h1>Chapter 3 I Want to Stay With You</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Amelia took her suitcase to her friend Eva Miller's residence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She gently knocked on the door and waited.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She and Eva were both orphans who grew up together in the same orphanage. They were like sisters.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Amelia, if anything happens to you, come home." Eva said when James took Amelia away five years ago.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Because of Eva, Amelia was able to easily move out of the apartment James bought for her. She still had a home to return to.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Eva soon opened the door. A wide smile appeared on her face when she saw Amelia.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Amelia, what are you doing here?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Amelia tightened her grip on the suitcase and said with somewhat embarrassment, "Eva, I need a place to crash."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Only then did Eva see the suitcase in her hand, and the smile on her face instantly froze.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"What's wrong?" Eva asked Amelia with a worried expression.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"I just broke up with him." Amelia forced a smile to hide her pain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Eva looked closely at Amelia and saw past her pretense in a matter of seconds. Her heart ached for her best friend.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Amelia was thin and pale, her eyes sunken.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Eva hugged her tightly. "Don't worry. I'm here for you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Amelia couldn't help but tear up at Eva&rsquo;s words.She hugged Eva and patted her gently on the back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"I'm fine, Eva. Don't worry."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Eva knew that Amelia was just trying to comfort her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She knew how much Amelia liked James.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">In the past five years, Amelia had worked hard to earn a million dollars and return it to James. She was so naive and innocent to believe that as long as she returned the money back to him, his feelings for her would change. Maybe if she gave him back the money, they could&hellip; be something more than just "employer and employee."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">But in the end, she couldn't be more wrong.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Eva remembered that rainy night five years ago...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">If it weren&rsquo;t for Ryan Jones, she wouldn't have met James.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">If that accident never happened, Amelia would have had a happy life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">But the past is in the past, and there's no time machine.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Amelia didn't want to burden Eva with her sorrow. After gently pulling back from the hug, she smiled and said, "Girlie, aren't you going to let me in? It's freezing out here!!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Eva was relieved to see Amelia still as strong and energetic as before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She believed that Amelia would soon recover from this breakup. For orphans like them who had no one to rely on, being abandoned is a walk in the park for them, right?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Nothing would drag them down as long as they were still alive.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">With this in mind, Eva felt better. She took Amelia's suitcase and led her into the house.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Amelia, don't say things like you need a place to crash or anything like that. This is your home too. You can stay as long as you want!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">After that, she turned around, fetched clean pajamas, and handed them to Amelia. "Go take a shower. I'll make you something to eat, have a good sleep. Don't think about anything else, okay?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Okay." Amelia took the pajamas and nodded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Eva had always been like this. She was unconditionally good to her, like a beam of light that sliced through the darkness in her life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">It was a pity that Amelia suffered from terminal heart failure, and her life was soon coming to an end.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">If Eva found out that she was going to die, with such a kind and gentle heart, she would cry.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Amelia didn&rsquo;t want to make her cry.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She looked at the busy figure in the kitchen and slowly walked over. "Eva, I want to quit my job."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Eva nodded in agreement and said, "Yeah, you should. You have been working hard for years. God, you must be exhausted. Quit your job and take a good rest at home. Don&rsquo;t worry about the money anymore, I got your back."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Okay," Amelia responded and felt her heart warm. Then she turned around and went to the bathroom with tears in her eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Fate had never favored her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">If she and Eva were meant to be apart from each other, she should use the last three months of her life to be with Eva, to keep her company.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The next morning, Amelia put on some makeup to cover up her pale face and lips, and went to the company to quit her job.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Just as she sat down and was about to turn on the computer to write her resignation letter, her colleague Bella came over.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Amelia, have you read the email?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Amelia shook her head. She spent the whole weekend in James&rsquo; penthouse, so she didn't have time to read the email.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Lily sent a letter of appointment saying that the chairman's daughter will come to take office as CEO today," Bella explained.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Amelia had no impression of the chairman's daughter, so she was not interested. She was about to quit anyway, it didn&rsquo;t matter to her who was going to take over the CEO position.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Bella on the other hand was very intrigued, "I heard she had just returned from studying abroad, so she doesn't have much work experience. Is she even qualified for the job?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Another colleague, Olivia, sneered and said, "Who would dare question her? She is the long lost love of Mr. Evans."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Hearing this, Amelia froze on the spot.</p></div>
