        <h1>Chapter 1856: Does It Hurt, James?</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul's slender fingers were flying over the keyboard, quickly typing away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he worked, the encrypted code on the screen gradually started to break open.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, midway through his operation, he noticed something strange about the chip's programming. It had split into two.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, he instinctively looked to James.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"James, I've seen this thing mentioned on hacker forums before. It's used to monitor and control the human body. How did you know about it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man sitting calmly next to him, hands folded, glanced sideways at a puzzled Paul.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's in my head."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul's heart skipped a beat. His blood ran cold at James' nonchalant statement. It felt like a snake had wound itself around his foot, slowly creeping up his leg, chilling him to the bone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ja-James, this is the most lethal weapon! How... how could it be in your head?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Compared to Paul's disbelief, James remained calm, almost indifferent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's there, that's all. Just tell me if you can shut these systems down."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James was bearing the pain silently, not willing to elaborate on how much it hurt. His nonchalance made many believe he was invincible, and thus took him for granted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only Paul felt for him. His fingers, resting on the keyboard, lifted involuntarily to touch James' head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though he couldn't see a wound, Paul knew the agony of having a chip implanted in one's brain. He tenderly stroked James' thick hair, his eyes misting with tears. "James, does it hurt?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James wasn't used to people touching his hair, only Amelia could. But facing a genuinely worried Paul, he didn't turn away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, he only let Paul do it for two seconds before stopping him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I still need to lead 'S' back to Erebus. Hurry up and turn off the tracking, location, and detonation systems in my head."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only by freeing himself from control, could he lead 'S' to victory against Matty. Otherwise, once he entered Erebus, he'd be the first one down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a few words, Paul understood what James had been through in Erebus. He didn't </span><span>ask further, but focused all his energy and knowledge on rewriting the program.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matty, aware that James was altering the program, sent a countdown signal as a warning when Paul broke the encryption.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But James, who got the countdown, knew for sure that Matty, who agreed to let him return, wouldn't take his life at this moment. Not only did he not stop, but he also let Paul carry on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul had met his match this time. After several unsuccessful attempts to break through, he suggested going to the company's computer center.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James warned Paul not to tell anyone about the chip, and then they arrived at the computer center.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as Paul sat down, he fired up all the equipment and threw himself into it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He worked all night to shut down the surveillance and tracking system. Just as he did, a rapid stream of code popped up on the large screen. In other words, while he was rewriting the program, the enemy hacker was trying to crack it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul, faced with a problem, looked troubled. He turned to James, "James, he has divided the chip program in two. We can try to extend the shut-off time for the surveillance and tracking system, but I can't even simulate the detonation system. It's probably not possible, unless..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James understood what Paul meant. The only way was to open the skull three times and remove the chip, but the risk of infection could lead to death or a vegetative state.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Knowing he couldn't die yet, James got up and walked slowly to the window. He looked at the employees coming and going in the Evans Group campus and fell into deep thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After hesitation, he made up his mind, pulled out his phone, and called the top doctors to rush to Arcadia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The doctors, upon receiving the news, dropped everything and rushed to Arcadia to take pictures of James, make reports, analyze, and consult.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After the unanimous assessment of several doctors, everyone advised against James having the surgery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Evans, removing the chip from your brain guarantees brain death. We strongly discourage it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul, standing at the side, turned pale when he heard the chip could lead to brain death, "But if we don't remove something from the brain, won't it be easier to die?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The chip's back at the tumor site, covered in the virus. Even tweezers could spread infection. Leaving it in might give him more time," the doctor showed Paul the chip's location on the film.</span></p></div>
