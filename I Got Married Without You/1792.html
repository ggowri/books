        <h1>Chapter 1792 Dylan came to Amelia</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Johnny followed his gaze and looked at Amelia, who was lying on the hospital bed, sound asleep. He spoke softly, "What do you want with her?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dylan walked in under Johnny's guarded gaze. "She previously took on a project for my grandfather, but there were some issues with the design plans she sent over. I've come to ask her to redesign them."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After explaining, Dylan, with clear and mysterious eyes, casually shifted his gaze from Johnny's face to the sleeping Amelia. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I just happened to see her here when I was visiting friends and family in the adjacent </span><span>ward, so I took the liberty to come and find her. But what's wrong with her?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Johnny was aware that Amelia was an architect, so he didn't doubt Dylan's words, but he remained cautious in his response. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She's pregnant and feeling a bit unwell, so she came to the hospital for a check-up."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dylan seemed surprised by the news of Amelia's pregnancy. "I see..." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Johnny nodded and began to politely usher Dylan out. "She's not in a condition to take on any projects right now, Dylan. You should come back later."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dylan looked at Johnny, who was by Amelia's side. "Alright, I'll come back to see her after she wakes up."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Dylan turned to leave, it seemed that his appearance here was indeed just a coincidence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia was deeply immersed in a nightmare, her forehead and back drenched in sweat. She dreamt that James repeatedly pushed her away, causing her to fall to the ground and struggle to get up. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, Emily, Brandon, and James together pushed her into the sea. She reached out for help, but James coldly turned away and swam off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ouch..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia clutched her chest, curled up in a small ball under the covers. Johnny hesitated for a moment, then took her hand and held it in his palm. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Amelia, you're having a nightmare again. Wake up, and the pain will go away."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia, entangled in her nightmare, couldn't hear his voice and was shivering from the cold. Johnny touched her forehead and found it to be very hot, prompting him to quickly press the call button. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Doctor, she has a fever again, come quickly!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The doctor soon arrived, examined Amelia, and then looked at Johnny. "Let's try physical cooling first. If that doesn't work, we'll consider medication."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Will taking too much medication affect the baby?" Johnny asked, feeling unexpectedly concerned, almost as if he were the child's father.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Realizing that he had been by Amelia's side during her pregnancy, he found it normal to be concerned. "Let's use as little medication as possible and try physical cooling first."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The doctor handed Johnny a prescription and gave him some instructions before leaving. Johnny quickly called for a nurse and then wheeled Amelia out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he emerged from the room, Eva and the others hurried over from the corridor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dylan, who was leaning against the wall of the adjacent ward, frowned as he saw more and more people arriving. "How's Amelia?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva, with her large pregnant belly, quickly approached Johnny with Paul's support. "She just woke up, but now she has a fever again."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing that Amelia had a fever again, Eva's heart sank, and she quickly went into the room. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The nurse was helping Amelia clean up, and Paul couldn't enter, so he asked Eva to go in first.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva saw Amelia's pale face and felt a pang of sadness. She sat down by the bed and took the towel from the nurse's hand. "I'll wipe her </span><span>forehead,</span><span> you can help clean the </span><span>rest."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The nurse agreed and went to the other side of the bed to help Amelia.</span></p></div>
