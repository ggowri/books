        <h1>Chapter 1625 Not intentional</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva inexplicably felt at ease, as if she could feel the man holding her would not harm her. She released his hand and hooked her arms around his neck, obediently snuggling into his embrace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul was tall while Eva was petite, like a doll hanging from him. He carefully held the doll and walked into the elevator, heading to the underground parking lot. He placed her in the passenger seat and fastened her seatbelt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he drove, he occasionally glanced at her. Seeing her messy hair covering her face while she slept soundly, he couldn't help but curl his lips. When a faint smile appeared on his face, he reached out his slender fingers and brushed Eva's hair away, gently touching her face...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was just a light touch, but Eva grabbed his hand as if she had caught a pillow at home, tightly holding it in her embrace. When Paul's fingers accidentally touched Eva's soft and perky chest, he instinctively retracted his hand. Ah, his heart, which was calm as still water, was now...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked at the traffic light, then at Eva. It might be better to wake her up and have her grab his hair...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Enduring his itching heart, Paul drove with one hand and arrived at Eva's house. He wanted to take his hand back from the woman who was sleeping in a daze, but she wouldn't let go.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feeling somewhat helpless, he unfastened her seatbelt, leaned over, and whispered, "Eva, if you don't let go, be careful I get naughty inside the car."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This statement seemed to have some effect as Eva's grip loosened a bit. Paul took the opportunity to pull his hand out and help Eva unfasten her seatbelt...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He got out of the car, walked around the front, opened the passenger door, and bent down to lift Eva up. He carried her into the villa and happened to be seen by Mandy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For the past month, Paul had always been the one to take Eva home. Every time he dropped her off, he would leave without saying much.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mandy thought Paul would do the same tonight, so she quickly stepped forward, intending to take Eva from his hands. However, Paul turned slightly, avoiding her </span><span>touch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Go run a bath, I'll carry her upstairs."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a few seconds of confusion, Mandy glanced at the unconscious Eva. This time, she was quite drunk. Paul probably said that because he was afraid Mandy couldn't carry Eva. After nodding lightly, Mandy turned and went to prepare the bathwater.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since Paul had been dating Eva, he had frequently been here and naturally knew where Eva's bedroom and bathroom were. Without Mandy's reminder, he carried Eva into the master bedroom's bathroom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After placing Eva on the chair in the bathroom, he intended for Mandy to take care of her. But unexpectedly, Eva clung to his clothes and vomited all over him...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul's body stiffened as he stared at the woman who was grabbing his clothes and vomiting incessantly. His face instantly darkened...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mandy, who had just brought a towel, saw this scene and was afraid that Paul would be angry. She quickly rushed forward, pulled Eva away, and tried to make amends to Paul with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Um, Paul, I'm sorry. She's drunk, it's </span><span>not intentional</span><span>..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mandy fetched a trash bin and placed it in front of Eva. Eva, who was feeling uncomfortable, was completely unaware of what she had just done. Holding onto the bin, she desperately continued to vomit.</span></p></div>
