        <h1>Chapter 1907 A Choice Between Two</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The dean caught sight of the aloof nobleman, his face suddenly taking on a sinister and terrifying expression. He felt a subconscious fear, but he had no choice but to continue explaining the situation and inform him of the risks after the assessment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If Stella were still here, continuously helping Mrs. Evans take care of her health, perhaps she wouldn't have developed pregnancy-induced hypertension. No matter how poor Mrs. Evans' health was, they could still find a way to get through the difficulties of childbirth. But now, she suddenly has pregnancy-induced hypertension, accompanied by coagulation dysfunction..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Of course, many pregnant women had issues with blood clotting, which could have been treated to prevent heavy bleeding during childbirth. However, your wife's health was really poor, and coupled with pregnancy-induced hypertension, she could have easily had a major bleed at any time and was also prone to complications.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They could offer two options at that point. First, if they insisted on giving birth, the mother could have died due to complications from the baby being too large, excessive bleeding, or other complications. The survival rate was only 10%. Second, they could have induced labor then. Although it was still risky, the baby wasn't as large yet, and the mother had a 30% chance of survival.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The child was over seven months old, and the pregnant woman showed no signs of premature birth. The only option was to induce labor, which also carried risks. However, when comparing the two situations, the latter clearly offered a greater chance of success.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The dean's calm and composed voice echoed in James' ears, no different from a demon demanding his life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James' fingers, clutching the report, were icy cold, as if all the blood in his body had turned to ice. He felt so cold, shivering uncontrollably, cold to the point of numbness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was the Dean's voice that roused James from his foggy stupor. "Mr. Evans," he said, "if you choose the latter option, you can't delay any longer. The longer you wait, the larger the fetus will grow, and the more dangerous it will be for the pregnant woman."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James lowered his head, staring at the icy cold report in his hands. Suddenly, the corner of his mouth curled up into a cold smirk, "No matter which option she chooses, she's going to die. So what's the point in choosing?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Dean paused for a moment, then reassured, "Mr. Evans, a 30% chance is better than 10%. And I will invite the top authoritative experts to perform the surgery, striving to increase that 30% to 40%."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Really?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James' rhetorical question was filled with despair. On a normal day, he would be heartbroken over the slightest injury to Amelia. To watch her experience death once again was like cutting flesh and drawing blood from his own heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All he wanted was a child, to spend the rest of his life as a family of three. Such a simple wish, yet not only was it not fulfilled, but the child they had struggled so hard to conceive was now threatening Amelia's life. It was utterly absurd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James couldn't help but let out a cold laugh, a laugh so intense that his whole body trembled. Even his thick hair, meticulously combed back, fell forward from his forehead due to his shaking shoulders.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Strands of hair obscured his eyes, but they couldn't hide the despair in his gaze. To have a child, a 10% chance; to not have a child, a 30% chance. Which choice didn't feel like falling into an abyss, descending into hell?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Why did such a choice have to fall on him? Was it because he had done too many wrongs in </span><span>his life, and this was his retribution? If the retribution had to be, why did it have to involve Amelia? Why did she have to suffer?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could bear anything, even his own death, but not losing Amelia. Yet, fate was cruel. It insisted on inflicting all the pain and suffering on Amelia, forcing him to watch as she slowly succumbed to death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James found the whole situation both cruel and absurd. They had finally gotten married, finally gotten pregnant, and finally escaped from Erebus. But before they even had a chance to truly enjoy their love, death was already knocking on their door, ready to take one of them away. Wasn't that just laughable?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a bitter smile, to the dean and the doctors, it seemed like the despair of falling into hell. But no one dared to persuade James. Everyone knew that their president loved his wife very much. Suddenly having to make this kind of choice, who could accept it?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inside the hospital conference room, it was eerily quiet until Andrew pushed open the door, shattering the deathly silence. "Mr. Evans," he began, "Mrs. Evans sent me to ask if the report is ready yet?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James slowly came back to his senses from his daze. He tossed the report in his hand aside and stood up from his chair, but his steps were unsteady. Instinctively, his fingers reached out to the conference table for support, finally stabilizing himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After enduring for a few seconds, he straightened his shaky body, turned around, and left. He didn't utter a single word before leaving, hinting at the two choices that led this lofty, star-like untouchable man into a life crisis.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing James emerge, Andrew's face turned pale and his steps faltered. He couldn't help but worry, "Mr. Evans, is there something wrong with Mrs. Evans' health?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James didn't respond to Andrew, he just walked briskly. When he reached the door of the hospital room and saw Amelia lying in the bed through the window glass, he suddenly lost the courage to face her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He turned and walked away. Andrew wanted to follow, but the man's icy voice suddenly echoed in the corridor, "If she asks about me, tell her I have matters to attend to. Ask her to wait patiently in the ward for my return. You and Peter take good care of her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Andrew had no choice but to stop. James left the hospital, got into the car, and with incredible speed, hit the highway. He floored the gas pedal and drove straight into the mansion of the Evans family.</span></p></div>
