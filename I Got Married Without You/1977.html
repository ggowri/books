        <h1>Chapter 1977 Protect Your Mother</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James smiled and ruffled his hair. "Knife, shooting, racing, ship, airplane, what do you want to learn first?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander looked up with his bright eyes and gazed at James. "Father, are you going to teach me these things?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man leaning against the sofa replied calmly, "You've learned enough theory. Now it's time to teach you some self-defense. You'll take my place in protecting your mother."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander tilted his head, looking puzzled. "Father, you're here with Mother. Why do I need to protect her?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feeling a headache coming on, James didn't tell his son about the chip in his brain. He simply reassured him, "I've been working on perfecting a robot lately, which takes a lot of my time. So, when I'm not around, you'll protect her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Believing it was due to the robot project, Alexander nodded. "Don't worry. Once I've learned, I'll definitely protect Mother well."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With his son's promise, James forced himself up from the sofa. "Let's start with shooting."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they got up, Alexander remarked, "When I was three, you beat me for playing with a gun. I thought you'd never let me touch one."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Surprised that Alexander remembered such a small incident, James said, "You were too young then. Of course, I couldn't let you near a gun."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But I'm only ten now, still not that old. Why are you letting me touch a gun now?" Alexander asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James stopped walking and looked back at his son, who barely reached his waist. "You're about to go abroad for school. By the time you return, it will be too late to learn these things."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander, a prodigy, had secured admission to the world's top school at a young age. He was about to embark on a journey to compete with other young geniuses in a foreign land.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James retrieved a gun that hadn't been used in ten years and took Alexander to the backyard. Andrew had already set up targets on the lawn, knowing that James planned to teach the boy to shoot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Peter had measured the distance, marked a safety line, and brought ear protection for Alexander. "Remember to aim carefully for your first shot. Don't just shoot wildly, or you might hit Andrew, and he won't be able to be saved by his wife in time."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's usually stoic face broke into a rare smile. "Peter, at least Andrew has a doctor wife who can save him. But you..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perpetually single, Peter quickly raised his hand to stop Alexander from continuing. "Enough. I like being single. No one to nag me, this is freedom."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Andrew, walking over from the lawn, teased, "And who is that single guy calling me late at night, asking my wife to introduce him to pretty doctors?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Peter elbowed Andrew's arm. "I'm still a man. Sometimes, loneliness hits hard at night."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander, suddenly serious, interjected, "Then go to my aunt's club and find yourself a girl."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Andrew, about to retaliate against Peter, heard this and glared at James. "Mr. Evans, did you teach your kid this stuff?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Loading bullets into the gun, James didn't look up but raised an eyebrow. "You should ask Paul."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Andrew crossed his arms and pondered, "Did Paul get desperate and start poisoning your son?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After showing Alexander how to fire the first shot, James replied, "I wouldn't be surprised by anything he does."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Andrew looked at Alexander, who seemed uninterested in the topic, and sighed in relief before grumbling about Paul, "He's really gone too far."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander, preparing for his second shot, defended Paul. "I already knew this stuff from my reading. You can't entirely blame Uncle Paul."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Andrew shook his head in amazement. "What a talented boy. Learning such things so early. Unlike your father, who had to ask me for his first time."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words trailed off as a sharp look from James silenced him. Realizing he had said too much, Andrew quickly covered his mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fortunately, Alexander didn't hear. "Andrew, what did you say? I didn't catch that."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Peter, who had heard clearly, hooked his arm around Andrew's neck and dragged him toward the bushes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You focus on your shooting. I'll get the details."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, loud laughter erupted from the bushes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander turned to see what the fuss was about but noticed James, filled with fury, striding toward the bushes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After finishing his fourth shot, Alexander heard Andrew's pleading voice. "Mr. Evans, I won't talk nonsense again. Please let me go!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then came Peter's wail. "Mr. Evans, spare my ears. I swear I won't laugh again!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander focused on his shooting. With each shot, his aim improved, while James' headache worsened.</span></p></div>
