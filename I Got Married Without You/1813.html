        <h1>Chapter 1813 Live the rest of life in regret</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking of the video she left before she died, saying that she would forget him for the rest of her life, forever forget him, the mist in Matty's eyes quietly dampened his eye sockets. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your grandmother always refused to wait for me. If she had been willing, your mother would have been very happy..." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sophia said she liked her daughter the most, so she sent her daughter away, not only to protect her daughter, but also to retaliate against him. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matty thought carefully, and there was only this one reason why she would tell him in the video that she only gave birth to two children. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, her whole life was spent competing with him. From the first meeting, she was competing with him. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I think Sophia shouldn't just be angry enough to send her own child away because you remarried. Is there another reason?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There is." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia thought he would deny it, but he nodded unexpectedly. "I hurt her first love." He didn't reveal too much, but Amelia grasped the key information from it. "Who was her first love?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matty's sharp eyes clouded over. "A despicable person." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia wanted to ask more, but Matty interrupted her and changed the subject. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She stared at Matty's not-so-good-looking face, and after a moment of silence, continued to ask. "You intervened, so Sophia should hate you more than love you, right?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matty saw that she was being a bit forceful, but he didn't get angry, just smiled and nodded. "You could say that." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then how did she have children with you?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matty sat up straight, staring at Amelia's puzzled eyes. "This is a question of first love and later love. You should be able to relate to it." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia knew what he was implying, and her face also darkened, but Matty continued. "Everyone will love several people in their lifetime, it's just a matter of who they love the most." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this point, Matty looked meaningfully at Amelia. "You love James the most, so you're willing to have children for him, and Sophia is the same." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia's thoughts were seen through, and she didn't argue with Matty. "I don't know the specifics of what happened between you and Sophia, and you don't know the specifics of what happened between me and James, so don't make this comparison." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking of James, Matty thought of the man lying in the biohazard area, nearly dying several times from infected wounds, and couldn't help but frown, but he didn't tell Amelia the truth. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Everyone has their own story, I won't judge your past, and you shouldn't judge mine. Let's talk about whether you'll come home with me or not." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I won't." Amelia's answer was decisive. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matty looked at Amelia for a long time, then spoke again. "I know you have opinions about me, but if I had a chance to start over, I would definitely not choose the second option, I would definitely marry her at all costs." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this point, Matty thought of </span><span>Sumasa</span><span>, who died of starvation on the street, and a rare look of heartache appeared in his aged eyes. "That way, your mother wouldn't have ended up like that, and you and your sister..." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matty paused, reached out, grabbed Amelia's hand, and covered it with his hand, gently patting it. "Amelia, I'm late, and I've let you suffer for so many years." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With so much said, just this one sentence made Amelia's eyes gradually turn red.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matty tightened his grip on her hand, and earnestly urged her. "Go home with your grandfather, and let me make it up to you for the rest of my life." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia hung her head and said nothing, while Matty continued to pat the back of her hand. "I don't want to live the rest of my life in regret. I hope you can give me a chance to reunite with my daughter's children." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia still didn't say anything, but Matty reasoned with her emotionally. "Child, I'm already in my seventies, I don't have many years left, so let me do something for my daughter's children before I pass away." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This statement made Amelia raise her eyes. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The old man sitting in front of her, with white hair and wrinkles all over, was obviously of a certain age. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia didn't know how much longer he had to live, but she could see the guilt in his eyes. "If Sophia hadn't lied to me back then, even if it was at the ends of the earth, I would have found </span><span>Sumasa</span><span>." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed that Matty was trying to make up for his regrets about Sophia through the children. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He took good care of his other two sons, but he was late for </span><span>Sumasa</span><span>. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The old man felt guilty and wanted to make up for his love for </span><span>Sumasa</span><span> through her children. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia understood very well the old man's purpose in wanting to take her home, but Canada was so far away...</span></p></div>
