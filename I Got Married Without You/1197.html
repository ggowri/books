        <h1>Chapter 1197 Amelia, you are really lucky to have escaped (2)</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just a sideways glance from Gloria was enough to make Amelia's heart tremble uncontrollably. Her gaze was so poisonous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia had never seen such a terrifying and vicious gaze before. Its impact was so strong that she instinctively hid behind James.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If she hadn't died back then, would she have fallen into Gloria's hands and been tortured to death like James's childhood friend?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because of her small movement, Gloria noticed her and his blood-red gaze slowly moved to the side.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Gloria saw Amelia's face, the hatred in his eyes gradually turned into evil as he smirked and said, "You're not dead?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gloria thought she had died a long time ago, but she never expected to see Amelia again one day, and even holding hands with James to come see her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gloria stared at her and sneered, "You're really lucky. You faked your death and escaped, otherwise I would have made you taste the pain of being tortured to death."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She guessed right. Gloria did plan to do that, but why did he have to destroy the person James cared about?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia was just accompanying James, and she couldn't speak even if she wanted to. She just held onto his arm and stood obediently on the side.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing that she didn't speak, Gloria's vicious gaze shifted back to James. When she saw the wedding ring on his left ring finger, her expression turned cold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're married?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man who used to hide Amelia away now held her hand in the open and showed Gloria their wedding rings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, I didn't do as you wished. In the end, I married her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gloria's gloomy eyes slowly filled with anger as he sought an accurate answer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She threw the book in her hand and raised her dry, burnt hand, pointing fiercely at Amelia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You promised your brother that you would marry Emily, how could you go against his dying wish and marry her?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The voice, so angry that it was deafening, came through the window...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not only did the volume not decrease, but it also carried a cruel desire for them all to go to hell.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Have you been bewitched by this woman and completely forgotten how good your brother was to you?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gloria looked like she had gone mad, glaring with her sunken eyes, and hysterically shouting at James.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you have any conscience left, divorce her and marry Emily, otherwise your brother will never rest in peace!!!"</span></p></div>
