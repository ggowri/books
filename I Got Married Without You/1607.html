        <h1>Chapter 1607 Recordings were exposed</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Andrew was not someone to mess with. With a single palm, he pushed Karen, who was in front of him. Andrew was strong, while Karen was fragile. As a result, she fell to the ground with a loud thud.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Karen grimaced in pain, trying to get up. Suddenly, Andrew's black leather shoe stomped on her fallen dress. Karen looked up and met a fierce face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From above, Andrew coldly stared at Karen. "I'll deal with you when I come back."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying this, he left the Simpson family, dragging Stella with him. Karen watched them leave, lying on the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a while, Karen suddenly burst into laughter. This was her son, whom she had struggled so hard for. This was her well-raised niece, treating her like this!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Andrew got Stella in the car, he glanced at her and noticed her pale face, cold sweat on her forehead, and trembling body. He couldn't help but feel sorry for her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stella, what's wrong with you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stella was usually calm and had never been so distraught. Was she being bullied by Karen?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Andrew was about to take Stella to the hospital for a check-up when he saw her trembling hands open her bag and take out a recording pen, handing it to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Cousin, please send this recording to the Simpson family..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wanted to expose Karen's actions, clear Erin's name, and let the Simpson family know that Karen had wanted to get rid of him when Erin was very young. Just based on this, Karen would not be able to stay with the Simpson family...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wanted Karen to face the consequences of her actions, to fall from the sky to the bottom of the valley, and also...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She killed Bart. Please find evidence and hand it over to the police."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Andrew listened to the recording, he froze for a moment when he heard Stella's words. The hatred in his eyes grew deeper.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She killed her own cousin. She's truly insane..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stella turned her head and looked out the rapidly retreating car window. She had also killed someone, the person who loved her the most. She was just as insane...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She curled her lips in a self-mocking smile. She truly lived up to being raised by Karen, with the same treacherous nature...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She could have aimed for his legs or hands, rendering him defenseless. But she deliberately targeted his heart...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wanted to get rid of him, to permanently escape from Erin. That's why she killed him. She wanted to kill him...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stella covered her aching heart with her hand, repeatedly asking herself, "Stella, now that you're finally free from Erin, are you happy?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She would never be happy again. Why? Because only now did she realize she had wrongly accused Erin. Only now did she know that the smart and rebellious young man had also loved her...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were supposed to have a mutual love, a noble ideal of healing and saving lives. But all of it was destroyed by her own aunt...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her own aunt had finally turned Erin into a dead man, turning her into a murderer. Their lives were completely destroyed...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their love and hatred for each other was a long-planned conspiracy...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their plans together over the years were a deceitful scheme...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stella opened her palm, covered in &ldquo;blood&rdquo;.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She shook her head, trying to shake off the &ldquo;blood&rdquo;, but it only seemed to increase.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feeling desperate, she rolled down the car window, letting the hot afternoon wind rush in...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought it would blow away the coldness on her skin, but it remained as chilling as ever.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stella told herself that Erin wasn't that good either. He had always bullied her since childhood, using words and violence to humiliate her. He was not good at all. Let him die...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But it was all because of Karen that Erin had become like this. It was Karen who made them turn against each other...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stella broke down, covering her eyes and letting tears flow freely from her fingertips...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After listening to the recording, Andrew was furious. He immediately sent it to the Simpson family and simultaneously shared it with the media in Imperial Capital to </span><span>help clear Erin's name and put pressure on the Simpson family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thomas, who was attending a meeting at the company, heard that the media were clamoring for an interview. Only then did he realize that his family's scandal had become public knowledge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His face turned pale with anger. He pushed away the microphone offered by the media, got into his car, and ordered the driver to quickly return home. He confronted Karen, grabbed her collar, and slapped her repeatedly, leaving Karen unable to move.</span></p></div>
