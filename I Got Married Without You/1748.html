        <h1>Chapter 1748 Reminder given by Scar Man</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In contrast to the carefree spectators above, the players below in the so-called "Hell Game Zone" were hovering over the number keys 1-4, trying to save their arms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The countdown sounded like a death knell, causing them to break out in cold sweats but not daring to take the first step.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone was watching the players in other game rooms, wanting to see which player would make the first choice and whether they would get their arm chopped off by the robot Mech-X like in the video.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were all quite scared. Only the player who had verbally harassed Amelia earlier, being more hot-tempered, tapped number key 3 after watching for a while.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment he tapped it, the four black boxes simultaneously opened, but unfortunately there were no apples in boxes 2-4. The red apple was clearly in box 1.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had just cursed when the words "You Lost" instantly appeared on the red door across from him. At the same time, the robotic arms of Mech-X reached out swiftly from inside towards him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He turned and ran, but his reaction was a beat slow. Plus a human could never outrun a machine. So before he got more than a few steps, the robotic arm grabbed him back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mech-X directly swung the steel knife in its hand down on his arm, chopping it off in one clean cut, with blood splattering everywhere. The cut was smooth and neat without any shreds of flesh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment Mech-X chopped at his arm, a piercing pig-slaughtering shriek echoed throughout the senior center, sending chills down everyone's spine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His game room 3 was right across from Amelia and the others. Seeing him writhing in pain on the ground, reaching out with his left hand to grab his severed arm, Amelia's heart started pounding furiously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although this guy was quite hateful, such punishment was overly cruel. What was even more terrifying was that they would soon face the same punishment after making their choices.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Amelia clenched her fists with a pale face, Johnny's steady voice sounded in her ear, "Don't be afraid."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She slowly lifted her eyelashes to look at Johnny. Seeing the resolute look in his eyes, she relaxed her trembling hands and suppressed all fear to calm herself down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The black boxes didn't reveal any flaws. In this situation, they could only rely on intuition and luck. But she wasn't sure if her intuition and luck were correct.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she stared at the black boxes indecisively, Scarface next to her seemed to hear a certain number. He quickly glanced at the monitor, then at a specific time, leaned in close to whisper:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lion, choose 2. Dumbass, you choose 1."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After speaking, Scarface swiftly moved back. Amelia and Johnny looked at each other, then at Scarface with puzzlement and suspicion. But after giving them the numbers, Scarface slapped the 1 key.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment he tapped it, the words "You Live" instantly appeared on the red door across from him, meaning he had chosen correctly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Trust me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Scarface didn't give them a good impression. Plus Amelia had been lured into this game by Emily, so how could they know if Scarface was sent by Emily to harm them?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, the mastermind behind Erebus emphasized the rules and wouldn't allow their own people to cheat during the game. But if someone was planted in, the mastermind wouldn't know.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Scarface was sent in advance by Emily, then following his words could get their arms chopped off in the first round.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Johnny thought about it and realized the only way to test if Scarface was sent by Emily was to take a risk himself. In any case, it was blind choosing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Amelia, I'll go first. If I'm wrong, just listen to him directly."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Amelia could stop him, Johnny tapped the opposite number to what Scarface specified&mdash;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Number 2.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Scarface looked on in shock, the words "You Lost" instantly appeared on Johnny's red door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Two robotic arms swiftly reached out from inside towards him&mdash;He suddenly looked up, and inside the red gate, as expected, he extended two robotic arms and rushed towards him at an extremely fast speed&mdash;&mdash;</span></p></div>
