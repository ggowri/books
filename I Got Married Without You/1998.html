        <h1>Chapter 1998 Rest in Peace</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Silent tears cascaded down from Amelia's eyes. Parting her lips as if to speak, she realized that she had already expressed everything she needed to say to James in this lifetime. With a heavy heart, she lowered her gaze at his pale, lifeless face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You fool, no matter how grievously your blood stained your face, you are still my husband. How could I be afraid? I absolutely wouldn't be. Why did you run off to a place like this all by yourself?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia never had the chance to bid her final farewell, and the regret weighed heavily on her. However, without taking this into consideration, James chose to conceal his demise from her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If she hadn't recognized the fake James, would it mean that she would never find his body in her life and that he would be frozen together with the snow and buried forever beneath the snowy mountains?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James had made ample provision for his death. Fearing that she would commit suicide, he built a robot and wanted to deceive her for the rest of her life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, she pondered, "James, despite the robot that looks just like you, it will never be you, after all. If you can lie to me for the rest of my life, I will accept it. But now, the lie has been exposed by me in an instant. Can you allow me to kill myself now?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Certainly not. Otherwise, you wouldn't have crafted a false robot to deceive me or fled to the mountains alone, enduring the agony of bleeding profusely, with only snow and dead trees as your companions, all in an attempt to make me believe."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James was incredibly foolish, and he loved her unconditionally. Even though it was a pity that Amelia was not by his side when he was dying, his love rendered her unafraid of decease at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She felt that ending her life with him would be the fulfillment of their lifelong promise. But was James, who had perished before, waiting for her in heaven?&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia had no answer. Sitting in the snow with James' cold body in her arms, she was unwilling to let go, no matter who pulled her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the heavy snow descended, the howling wind pierced everyone's ears, yet no one uttered a word. Silence enveloped the snow-covered mountains until the very last moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander, who was already exhausted, sat in the snow and stared in disbelief at James, whose eyes were closed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Alexander also realized that James, who had been omnipotent since childhood, died on the snowy mountain before the operation was about to succeed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he wondered, "I've told him that it would take me another two months to succeed. Why wasn't he willing to persevere a little longer?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And why was I so stupid as not to have completed the operation two months in advance?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, was it my father who couldn't hold on?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was my incompetence."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With this in mind, Alexander raised his hand and slapped himself hard in the face, which made a deafening noise in the quiet mountains and frightened the birds and other animals to flee away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Compared to Eva and the others, who covered their mouths and wept, Alexander did not shed a single tear. He just bent down and pressed his face against James' icy body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm sorry."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander thought, "I'm sorry. It was my incompetence that prevented me from recognizing your condition earlier and assessing the operation's success rate, resulting in your miserable passing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My father, I am truly sorry."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grace, who rushed over later, found James motionless and was suddenly reminded of the first time they met. Back then, he had been clad in military boots and had forcefully pushed open the door of the small, dark room. Like a savior descending from heaven, he seized her arm, liberated her from the enclosure, and cradled her in his arms, allowing her, dirty, to rest her head on his shoulder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But such a god-like figure perished on the snowy mountain on the day of Alexander's coming-of-age ceremony. Grace couldn't accept it. Not even daring to get close to James, she shrank behind Phil with her whole body trembling and the tears falling incessantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, the grief of the loss overwhelmed her, and she ran over to James in sobs. "I don't know why you suddenly became severely ill. I only wish you to get up and call me Grace again, okay?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What responded to her was endless silence, which indicated that no one in this world would ever scold her with a disdainful yet composed tone, "Grace, if you touch me again, I will break your legs..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grace bawled hoarsely while Alexander was quiet with blank eyes. Only Amelia stubbornly hugged James, letting the stiff and straight man lean tightly in her arms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Others assumed Amelia was too heartbroken to get up, but Eva could tell that Amelia intended to die here with James. Instead of resorting to any radical methods, Amelia just sat there in a daze, trying to experience the gradual chill of her blood and anticipating the arrival of death as James had done in the snow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After wiping away the tears from her eyes, Eva walked over and embraced Amelia from behind, who was already freezing. "Amelia, he's dead. Release him, and let us transport him back. At least we should have him rest in peace, right?"</span></p></div>
