        <h1>Chapter 1853: Understanding Matty's Intentions</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Outside the Cloud territory, a helicopter landed smoothly on the lawn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The suit-clad man in the pilot's seat turned to look at the man with closed eyes, "Cobra, it's time to disembark and switch rides."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His usually thick eyelashes slowly lifted, a cold murderous intent flashed in his eyes. The suited man felt a chill crawl up his neck, then blackness consumed his vision as he suddenly slumped onto the steering wheel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James withdrew his long hand, wearing an emotionless expression, he removed his tie from around his collar. Looping it around his fingers, he stepped down from the helicopter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The pilot waiting for the switch saw James knock out the suited man and swarmed towards him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James tightened his fist around the tie and faced the encroaching crowd. Without blinking, he threw punch after punch, landing them heavily on the faces of the pilots.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite being injured, he was still more than a match for Erebus's men. In no time, he had taken down a group of them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James kicked an unconscious pilot out of his way, his icy gaze fixed on the helicopter. Unraveling the tie around his hand, he quickly returned to the helicopter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He started the engine, took control of the joystick, and with one fluid motion, the helicopter roared into the sky. As it flew away, a black tie fluttered down to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at the discarded tie, the beaten pilots grabbed their phones and called the surveillance room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Boss, James has escaped."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing of James's escape, everyone turned to Matty. But he showed no emotion and simply replied, "Let him go."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wanted to give James the chance to return with reinforcements, so he could catch them all at once. It was a more efficient strategy than picking them off one by one.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James had to admit that Matty was a master strategist. He manipulated every situation to his advantage. From using Amelia's desire to save him, forcing him to break up with her, and now staging his escape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In reality, Matty's plan was to have him bring back the S for a final sweep. That was his ultimate goal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite guessing Matty's intentions, James was still determined to avenge Zack and the others. His immediate priority was to remove the chip in his brain and break free from Matty's control.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He remembered Amelia contacting Andrew before entering Erebus and figured they must be nearby. So, he landed the helicopter outside the Cloud territory.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He needed to return home to deal with the chip as soon as possible. So, the first thing he did after landing was to abandon the helicopter, move to a public area, and call Andrew.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Andrew, who was searching for Erebus in the Cloud territory, heard James's voice on the phone and a weight lifted from his heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Evans, I'm on my way."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without waiting for a reply, Andrew hung up. Peter, who was eager to hear James's voice, was frustrated at the abrupt end of the call.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Couldn't you have let me say a few words to him before hanging up?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There's nothing to say. We'll see Mr. Evans soon."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Andrew started the car and drove towards James's location. Peter, still annoyed, punched Andrew's arm in retaliation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Andrew winced in pain but didn't fight back. Instead, he shared a laugh with Peter. For them, as long as Mr. Evans was alive and safe, they could breathe easy and smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Andrew arrived at the public area where James was waiting before dusk. He spotted him immediately, standing in the sunlight with his hands in his pockets.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James always looked calm and composed, like a resilient flower blooming in winter, standing tall despite the harsh conditions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man bathed in the soft golden light seemed like a blossom of purity amidst the crowd. His silent presence was both alien and captivating, like a celestial being that wasn't from this world.</span></p></div>
