        <h1>Chapter 2001 Postponing His Marriage</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia stroked the back of Alexander's head. She seemed to have come to terms with these facts long ago, and her expression was composed. "When are you going to get married?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stiffened. With tears in his eyes, he slowly raised his head and let go of Amelia. "Mom, I haven't met the girl I like yet."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Noticing her reflection in his eyes, she touched her face. "Look, I'm suffering more than death. Why don't you let me die?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander thought, "When I was a child, it was my parents who retrained me. However, it was different as I matured. Only by holding onto my mother can I avoid being an orphan. So, let me be selfish again, okay?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He grabbed Amelia's arm and begged, "Mom, please wait a little longer. Soon, I will meet my love and marry her, okay?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, unwilling to break Alexander's heart, she nodded as usual. "Then, I will go to church tomorrow and pray for you. I hope you can find your girl soon."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander replied, "Okay." Yet, while secretly pleading with all the gods not to accept Amelia's wish, he would like to remain single for the rest of his life in order to gain her attention.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Postponing his marriage, he retrieved the robot left by James. He explained to Amelia that all of James' final words were programmed into the robot, which would reveal a portion each day. To hear everything James had said, she must stay alive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At first, Amelia didn't want to see the robot that looked exactly like James, but the moment he spoke, she suddenly stopped and then sat in the study. Day after day, she listened to James saying the most romantic words in the world to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Like back then, he couldn't find her and could only use Wesley's number and send her more than a dozen text messages a day to commemorate her demise in this way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, it was evident that he had passed away first. Fearing that she would be left lonely for the remainder of her days and perhaps even contemplate suicide, he had ingeniously employed a robot to convey his affection to her each day.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While listening to his words, Amelia often burst into tears. Then, her vision became blurred, and everything overlapped. Gradually, her health grew poorer and poorer until she was on the verge of death.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia understood that when someone was dying, their organs would fail. Even with additional medication, it wouldn't rescue someone suffering from liver damage due to depression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, for the next few days, instead of urging Alexander to marry, she supported her tottering body and opened the safe again.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inside, there were scarves, torn sheets of letter paper, a marriage certificate, and Amelia's annual birthday gift for James. They were evidently only some inexpensive articles, but he kept them in a safe like a treasure and locked them up with a password so that no one could open the safe or take them away.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia deliberated for a considerable time before discerning the password. Though unaware of the significance behind James initially falling in love with her, she was certain he would use the date of their encounter at Arcadia University as the password.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought she understood James. After she entered the password, it suddenly dawned on her that this was his regret that, at that time, he did not have any ability to pursue her openly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In her eyes, if he had been powerful, he would definitely have stood by her side regardless of everything. On a rainy night, even without a black umbrella, he would have been able to shield her from all the wind and rain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately, James, in his twenties, was controlled by Gloria. Even someone like him could not defeat a madwoman, so he did not dare to express his love. At the same time, Amelia did not give him the courage to confess.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On a sunny afternoon, Alexander also asked Amelia what the most regrettable thing in her life was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She replied calmly, "Over those five years, I had ample opportunities to tell your father that I had a crush on him, yet every time, the sight of his cold face made me falter, too timid to convey the depth of my fondness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is the biggest regret in my life. If I had admitted it earlier, your father and I wouldn't have wasted eight years together, and we would have had more time to understand and cherish each other."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander came to the realization that James and Amelia had always harbored deep affection for each other. Unfortunately, they encountered the right person at the wrong time, causing them to miss each other for eight long years. It was indeed a pity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After caressing the items in the safe one by one, Amelia pivoted around to fetch the gifts James had given her and put them inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Like safeguarding their love profoundly, she secured everything within the safe, implying that if they couldn't be together for a lifetime, their possessions would remain united for eternity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Later, Amelia gripped the wall for support and descended the stairs step by step to the back garden as usual. Seated on the rattan swing, she swayed gently back and forth, carried by the breeze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When James was alive, Amelia requested a swing. So, he made a chair out of rattan and then decorated it with flower vines to build this swing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Recalling his affectionate behavior, she gripped the rope of the swing and bowed her head, resting it on the back of her hand. Then, facing the sunlight streaming down from the sky, she softly shut her eyes...</span></p></div>
