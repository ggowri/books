        <h1>Chapter 1746 Clean your mouth</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Johnny lowered his head and apologized to her in a low voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Sorry old age</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia wanted to complain, but when she touched his gaze, she suddenly thought of James.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every time he did something wrong, he always kept a low voice and apologized to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't say anything in the end, just glanced at him and continued to stare at the control console.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Now, players, please go to the selected area.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The electronic sound disappeared, and the door reopened. However, after opening it this time, it was not the scene we had just seen, but an upward staircase.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The white light, projected from above the four stairs, resembled the intersection of heaven.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Players, please come to the selected area within one minute.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Those who do not arrive on time will be shot.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Repeat, those who do not arrive on time will be shot.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Now let's start the countdown, 60, 59, 58.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under the countdown, Amelia and Johnny didn't have time to think. They quickly took a step and walked towards the stairs, taking a total of four turns, equivalent to crossing the space of childhood, youth, and middle age and directly entering the </span><span>elderly space.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When they arrived at the fourth floor, many people had already arrived, about ten of whom were chatting with each other. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One of them was a richly dressed Scar Man, who raised his eyebrows slightly when he saw the two of them coming up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Why are you two still wearing handcuffs?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This statement attracted other players, and everyone turned to Amelia and Johnny.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;You're not supposed to be tied up, are you?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Isn't this game a voluntary participation?&rsquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Johnny was used to being arrogant and lazy to talk to these people.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia, on the other hand, was cold and standing aside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A few men suddenly lit up their eyes when they saw Amelia's face and figure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Hello, beautiful, have you have been kidnapped by this man?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia remained silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Hey, you look quite proud, I don't know how it feels to play with you.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Johnny suddenly grabbed Amelia's hand and rushed over, lifting her foot and aiming it at the man's lower body, kicking him hard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Ah -.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man who was kicked off guard suddenly covered his lower body in pain and fell to the ground, howling loudly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Clean your mouth.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Johnny finished warning, he kicked him hard a few more times until he kicked the other person to beg for mercy, and then he stopped kicking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Other players, seeing Johnny's irritable temper, settled down and dared not look at Amelia with colored glasses again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia, on the other hand, raised her eyes to Johnny, who was dragging her, and suddenly felt his back gradually becoming more majestic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;So you're not angry with me anymore?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Johnny lowered her fan-shaped thick eyelashes and stared into Amelia's eyes, shining with a sparkling anticipation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia nodded lightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Johnny saw that she was no longer angry and curled her lips, revealing a happy arc.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Dear players.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the moment when the electronic audio system started, the originally empty floor slowly rose to the four grid game hall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Each game hall has three positions, with a square white table in front of them.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Across the table, there is a square red gate.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;There are four game halls that appear in front of you now. Please choose your own game location.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia and Johnny, before taking a step, the people next to them rushed to seize the good seats.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After being snatched by this group of people, only Game Hall 4 remained. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia and Johnny looked at each other and walked over, while Scar Man followed </span><span>their steps.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Johnny had just stood in position when she saw Scar Man following her and instinctively furrowed her brow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;What are you doing with us?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Scar Man spread out his palm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;There are only twelve people in total, four game halls, each with three positions. I don't have to choose anymore.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Johnny was speechless and could only guard against him, as their positions were quite close together.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Johnny remained twelve percent vigilant, and Amelia also rose to her guard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, in such a place, the heart of guarding against people was indispensable.</span></p></div>
