        <h1>Chapter 1924 Where is that temple?</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When James refused to hold the baby, Eva guessed that he might blame the child for Amelia's condition, which is why he didn't want to bond with their son and didn't force himself to do so.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva picked up the baby and placed him next to Amelia, then she took Amelia's hand and placed it on the baby's belly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was probably a mother-son connection. As soon as Amelia's hand touched the baby, he started crying...</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing the baby's cry, James' eyes welled up with tears.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His slender fingers, uncontrollably, reached out and placed themselves on the baby's small hand...</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crying baby gradually stopped when he felt the touch of the man's hand.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With his teary and innocent eyes wide open, he curiously stared at James while using his tiny fingers to grab onto James' pinky...</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The baby's five fingers were just enough to hold onto James' pinky.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that moment, James became the baby's everything, and he raised his other hand to cover his eyes...</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He cried uncontrollably, repeatedly asking Amelia, "When will you wake up? If you don't wake up soon, I don't think I can go on..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva, standing beside him, also couldn't stop her tears. It had been two months, and Amelia still showed no signs of waking up.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She lay there, silent and motionless...</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the third month, Andrew and Peter finally found an old doctor who specialized in treating comatose patients.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, he was a bit old and had retired to the United States.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The old doctor hadn't treated patients in a long time, and when he heard that the patient was the wife of The Evans Group's CEO, he was even more afraid that he wouldn't be able to cure her, so he refused.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When James found out, he didn't care whether the old doctor could save Amelia or not.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He just wanted a glimmer of hope, so he brought a large sum of money and pleaded with the old doctor to come.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After examining Amelia's condition, the old doctor couldn't be certain if she would wake up, but he said he would do his best and try different methods.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James was afraid that the old doctor's attempt might not work, so he asked Matty to borrow Dr. Moore.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moore reluctantly came to the hospital and discussed the treatment plan with Dr. Lewis before giving his approval.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only after James felt assured did he entrust Amelia to the old doctor.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, both the old doctor and Moore said that the chances of her waking up were slim.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The only difference was that Moore chose to give up, while the old doctor was willing to try again.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As long as the doctor didn't give up, James was willing to take the gamble because fate always seemed to deny him his wishes.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could only rely on himself, fight against destiny, and change his fate.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dr. Lewis, the old doctor, came to the hospital every day to treat Amelia, but the results were not significant.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva started to worry and turned to praying to gods and buddhas.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She went to a temple, made a wish, and obtained two amulets&mdash;one was placed in the baby's crib, and the other was placed under Amelia's pillow.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After placing the amulets, Eva held Amelia's hand and whispered gently in her ear, "Amelia, do you remember when you were on the brink of life and death? I went to a temple and prayed for you to come back to life. It worked that time, and three years later, you did come back. I went again this time, hoping that the gods and buddhas will continue to watch over you and help you wake up soon."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing Eva's words, the man standing beside her, as if a frozen sculpture, showed a slight change in expression. "Where is that temple?" he asked.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva was taken aback for a moment, then she looked up at James' face, which had become extremely defined due to his recent weight loss. "Are you... planning to go?"</span></p></div>
