        <h1>Chapter 1993 The Last Deep Kiss</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Can you tell the difference between salt and sugar now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James looked at Amelia who was asking the question and shook his head slightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's thick eyebrows, which were as thick as distant mountains, gradually frowned... Why was he having such an ominous feeling?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This ominous feeling was confirmed after Alexander tasted the steak that he couldn't chew no matter how hard he tried.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Especially when he saw the two naughty men, Andrew and Peter, covering their mouths to hold back their laughter, Alexander felt that he had been deceived.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He resisted the urge to vomit and glanced at Ken and Barbie who were wearing high school uniforms. "Do you want to try it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They stared at the food on the plates and shook their heads frantically. "My dad said that even dogs wouldn't eat the food that Uncle James cooks, so we don't want to try it..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was speechless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was rare to see Alexander being frustrated, and Ken and Barbie were so happy. "Alexander, this is the birthday gift prepared by Uncle James for you. You must eat it all, otherwise he will be disappointed..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man sitting on the main seat also looked at his son expectantly. Alexander swallowed his saliva as he read in his father's eyes that he wanted him to eat them all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With trembling hands, he picked up the knife and fork, and complained in his mind that why did he want his father to cook as the birthday present? Wasn't this like grabbing food from dogs?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander sighed, as he was facing death. He cut up a piece of steak with a knife and continued to chew it in his mouth... While chewing, he surprisingly chewed out a piece of plastic film!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing him pull out the plastic film from his mouth, the Evans family, the Lawrence family, and the Clark family who gathered around him first looked surprised, and then burst into laughter...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Neil, who was carrying a camera, happened to see this scene and thought it was quite warm, so he quickly pressed the shutter button and took a picture.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He once captured a sweet picture at Eva's wedding, but in this picture, there are fewer people, but also more people.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps life is like a passing egret. In just a few decades, a quick glance or a look between two people will always fade away quietly. What can be freeze-framed is the beautiful moment people have experienced...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Alexander tasted the plastic film in his food, he was unwilling to eat this dinner anymore. So he put it on the table and then stretched out his big hand to ask others for gifts to divert his attention.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the moment the clock struck 12, James felt the strings in his head suddenly collapse with the sound of the clock, just like the chip suddenly cutting through the recurrent brain cancer. In an instant, the blood flowed backwards...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under the gaze of everyone, Alexander walked towards the stage with steady steps, then took the microphone from Dylan's hand. Like a rising star, he shone brightly and confidently, thanking his parents...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, James could not hear a single word he said. The world suddenly became quiet, with only the sound of blood boiling and cancer cells spreading recklessly in his brain, and... the ticking sound of blood penetrating the eardrums, scratching his skin, and dripping onto his shoulders.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sitting in the dark, James raised his cold fingers and touched his ears. The blood still had temperature, seeping into his skin bit by bit, making him feel that he could still hold on for a moment. He took advantage of this moment to look at Alexander who was being chased by the lights, and...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He held his blood-stained fingertips tightly in his palm, then turned sideways and grabbed Amelia's waist. Taking advantage of the time when the light was no longer on them, he lowered his head and kissed Amelia's red lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He bit her lips deeply, using all his strength, as if saying his final farewell. He kissed her so reluctantly and madly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If possible, he wanted to kiss her until the end of time, but life was unpredictable. If the chip was removed, there was still brain cancer. Even if he could hold on for another two months, he would not be able to wait for Alexander. Besides...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His body was telling him that the love and warmth he had given in this life would end here, and there would be no more. After all... a person like him should be content to be able to live to this age, but...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't bear... He couldn't bear to leave his Amelia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sensing James' difference, Amelia wanted to reach out and touch him, but he grabbed her wrist. The man used his last breath of life to turn all his affection into a strong and lingering kiss, and then slowly let her go in great reluctance...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I remembered that I haven't had time to give you today's roses. I'll go get them."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After he finished speaking, he leaned on the armrest of the chair and stood up to leave, but Amelia grabbed his wrist. A coming-of-age ceremony was being held on the stage, and the lights were all on Alexander. The light below the stage was very dim, so it was impossible to see this tall and straight man's face, which was so pale and with blood all over...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll go with you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man's eyes were covered with blood, blocking his vision. He knew how scary he was at the moment, so he didn't even dare to turn his head and just pushed her hand away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I have something to talk with Paul too. You don't need to go. Just stay here and wait for me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After he finished speaking, he kicked Paul, who was sitting next to him and clapping. "Paul, come with me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he said this, a light flashed by, and Paul saw his bloody face. Paul was so scared that he lost his voice in an instant. "James, you..."</span></p></div>
