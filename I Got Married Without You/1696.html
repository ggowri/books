        <h1>Chapter 1676 Please keep my boat</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We're not going to be with the Clark family." The Evans Family and the Clark family have a feud. For the sake of Amelia, they will temporarily coexist peacefully, but joining the Clark family's team? Impossible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well then, Amelia is a member of my Clark family. Ms. Miller is her sister, so she's also part of my Clark family. Mr. Collins is neither from the Evans Family nor the Clark family, so he can be on my side for now. And Anthony..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop! Anthony is my good friend, why do you have any ideas about him?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He's just your friend, not a blood relative. Why does he count as a member of the Evans Family?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He was my sister's first love, so of course he counts as a member of the Evans Family."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Paul said this, Anthony suddenly looked up and glanced at Edith. She sat next to Ryan, as if she hadn't heard anything, showing no reaction as if the term "first love" didn't mean anything to her anymore. Anthony's lips also showed a hint of bitter smile. Paul seemed to realize that he had said something inappropriate in his haste and quickly changed his words. "Regardless, Anthony is my friend and I will never help anyone from your Clark family go against me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When the two sides were deadlocked in a struggle for numbers, Eva stepped forward to speak up for her husband. "Mr. Clark, Amelia is already married to James. Therefore, she is a member of the Evans Family. I also married Paul, making me a member of the Evans Family as well. As for Mr. Collins, he is my brother, so naturally he's on my side."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, you can team up with whoever you want. We four can defeat you anyway," Herb said, then turned to Johnny and raised his eyebrows. "Right, cousin?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Johnny gave him a cold glance. What luck was he playing? Didn't he know he had bad luck?!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From his angry eyes, Herb could see a sense of determination, which made him not afraid at all. He raised his fair hand and patted the table. "Alright, everyone, let's start betting!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Miles loved playing this kind of game, so when he heard the word "bet," he immediately threw his gambling chips onto the table. "I bet one million that I will win!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Christopher glanced at him. "You only play video games usually. Can you even play this kind of gambling game, let alone bet on yourself to win?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Miles crossed his arms confidently and flicked his stylish bangs. "Christopher, today I'll show you what it means to be the gambling king."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The gambling king lost in the first round. Miles silently turned around and left, while the others continued...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This game was quite simple. It was just about drawing numbers and matching them in order. If you drew the specified matching number, you could move on to the next round. As Herb said, it was purely based on luck. Those with bad luck would be eliminated quickly, while those with good luck could continue playing from number 1 to 10 and beyond.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ryan had extremely good luck, drawing the specified number every time. He couldn't stop playing even if he wanted to.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Besides him, there were James, Amelia, Paul, Eva, Herb, and Johnny, who had terrible luck but surprisingly did well this time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This time it's drawing an A, and whoever draws it has a chance to reach the final round."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as Herb finished speaking, Johnny drew an A, leaving him somewhat incredulous. Paul suddenly hugged his cards and shouted, "I didn't draw it, it's up to you guys now! I have to protect my ship!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ryan, who also didn't draw an A, breathed a sigh of relief. It was finally over. He put down his cards, pushed his wheelchair, and left the crowd, sitting quietly in a corner, watching Amelia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he saw the smile on her face, he couldn't help but smile too...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But then he caught a glimpse of James' handsome face in his line of sight, and his smile instantly froze. He quickly averted his gaze, avoiding James' scrutiny, while James... Besides Ryan, there were Johnny and Herb. Of course, he didn't need to pay attention to a kid like Herb, but Johnny... Throughout the game, Johnny's eyes were always uncontrollably focused on Amelia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James frowned, thinking about how he would deal with Johnny later. He threw his cards onto the table. "When will this end?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This boring and childish game kept going round after round. He didn't know what possessed him to accept Herb's challenge.</span></p></div>
