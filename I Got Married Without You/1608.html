        <h1>Chapter 1608 Mike abandoned Karen</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Karen never expected that Stella would put a recording device in her bag and manipulate her words. She even told the media that Karen used malicious tactics to go against Erin in order to secure her son's inheritance. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This recording completely destroyed the image she had built over the years in the Imperial Capital circle. Everyone, including the high society ladies and the whole internet, </span><span>was</span><span> calling her a crazy </span><span>homewrecker</span><span> and telling her to die and return Erin. She </span><span>was</span><span> so afraid that she </span><span>didn&rsquo;t</span><span> dare to leave her house. Thomas </span><span>didn&rsquo;t</span><span> even listen to her explanations. He only </span><span>felt</span><span> that she ha</span><span>d</span><span> embarrassed him, so he </span><span>hit</span><span> her </span><span>hard </span><span>when he </span><span>came</span><span> back. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Karen </span><span>was</span><span> furious, but she </span><span>knew</span><span> that Thomas </span><span>was</span><span> her husband. If she </span><span>said</span><span> a few kind words and apologizes, he </span><span>would</span><span> forgive her. But who would have thought that Thomas would cry? </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you know how well-behaved and intelligent Erin was before I married you? He not only had a talent for medicine, but also had an incredible memory. Just by looking at the data on my computer, he could tell where the problem was. Such a good child, but you ruined him..." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thomas couldn't continue as he sobbed. "I shouldn't have drunk that glass of wine you handed me back then!" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was that glass of wine that led to his downfall, causing him to abandon his wife and child for Karen. Now he face</span><span>d</span><span> this kind of ending, and he deserve</span><span>d</span><span> it! </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thomas raised his hand and slapped himself hard before turning around and leaving. Watching his resolute figure leaving, Karen's heart skipped a beat. She quickly crawled over and grabbed his trouser leg. "Husband, it's not my fault. The one who killed Erin is Stella, not me!" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thomas paused for a moment, then turned his head back to Karen, deeply disappointed. "Stella is your weapon--" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Karen was kicked away by Thomas. Seeing Thomas blaming Erin's death on her, Karen clenched her fists in anger and her eyes turned malicious as she looked at Mike, who was leaning against the railing, enjoying the show. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She couldn't believe that </span><span>when </span><span>she was about to be abandoned by Thomas, this younger son </span><span>could have</span><span> such a</span><span>n</span><span> indifferent attitude. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Karen felt both cold and resentful. "Mike, if it weren't for you blabbing, how could that bitch Stella have gotten hold of my weakness? You're so indifferent, aren't you afraid of losing your inheritance once I'm overthrown?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, little Mike let go of the pendant around his neck and, stepping in his black leather shoes, walked step by step in a gentlemanly manner towards Karen. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After helping her up, he suddenly looked up and revealed a sinister smile. "Karen, even if you're overthrown, it won't affect me because big brother is already dead, and </span><span>Andrew</span><span> can't come back. Father won't let the cousin's child inherit the power, so no matter if you fall or not, father will help me." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, it</span><span> was</span><span> even better if she </span><span>fell</span><span> because such a foolish mother </span><span>would</span><span> only drag him down in the future. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This sentence completely stunned Karen. She didn't expect Mike, who was so young, to weigh the pros and cons so carefully, to the point of being willing to give up such a powerful backing like her... </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Karen felt a chilling sensation throughout her body. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Mike let go of her hand, he politely bowed to her and then walked briskly to catch up with Thomas. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thomas, who was about to get into the car to return to the company and deal with the news, immediately turned cold when he saw Mike following him, thinking that he was going to speak up for his mother. "What are you doing here?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mike opened the car door himself, got in, and then showed an innocent expression to comfort Thomas. "Dad, it's my mom's fault for treating big brother like that. I'm here to apologize to you on her behalf. Even though this apology means nothing, I still don't want to see you so sad..." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying that, he used his small hand to pat Thomas' aged face... </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing the innocence in his youngest son's eyes, Thomas felt somewhat relieved. Thankfully, this son was not influenced by Karen, and he also had knowledge of finance at such a young age, comparable to Erin when he was young. It was truly a blessing. Thomas reached out and grabbed Mike's small hand, placing it in his palm, and patted the back of his hand with his large and gentle palm. "Mike, study hard. When you grow up, I will definitely hand over the inheritance to you..." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mike pretended to be ignorant and blinked at Thomas. "I don't really understand the inheritance, but I only know that as long as Dad is healthy and by my side for the rest of my life, I will be happy..." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These words earned Thomas a hug. "You are truly my good child." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But as </span><span>Mike</span><span> was being embraced, his eyes gradually grew cold, revealing a triumphant smile after his plan succeeded...</span></p></div>
