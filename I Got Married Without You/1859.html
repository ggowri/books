        <h1>Chapter 1859: Matty's Last Stand</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing Matty's words, a pang of anxiety seized everyone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So soon?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If it were me, I'd rush back to seek revenge, free from tracking and bombing threats," Matty nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Considering James' protective nature, he'd not sit idle. Their task now was to prevent the enemy hacker from changing the bomb's program. With that thought, Matty took over from a programmer, swiftly disabling the complex encryption system and shortening the bomb countdown.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul, monitoring the computer, was furious as his hard-earned delay was shortened. He resumed typing with cramped fingers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a flash, the delay was extended again. Matty grinned with admiration, "This kid's good, better than any of you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The operator, uninterested in hacking prowess, asked, "Big bro, James is coming tomorrow. We only have external explosives. Will it work?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They could monitor S's chopper, detonate the bomb when it lands, and retreat. But they feared the explosives wouldn't kill everyone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Compared to the operator's anxiety, Matty was much calmer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Eason, tell Carson to wait outside with his crew. They're on cleanup duty post-blast," Matty instructed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But if we bail, leaving Carson to handle S, isn't that throwing him under the bus?" Eason, close to Carson, objected.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't forget. Without Carson, James wouldn't have breezed into the upper zone. A traitor's sacrifice is due course," Matty snapped back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eason fell silent, outnumbered by Matty's supporters.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>S's unity contrasted sharply with Erebus' survival instinct. Eason felt a pang, "Easy for you to say. You're not the ones on the chopping block."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We're here to take out S, who hurt your family. Not to debate sacrifices," Matty soothed, patting his shoulder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I won't spill to Carson. But send more backup," Eason begrudgingly conceded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite his friendship, Eason prioritized revenge. All operators were here for vengeance, self-preservation over friendship.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matty promised more support, then addressed others, "Explosives, defense, my granddaughter, all are to restrain James. Any concerns?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the extra assurance, operators shook their heads, "Let's see how James and S walk into our trap."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They could leave, but stayed to witness S's downfall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carson understood Matty's plan when he got Eason's call.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He felt a chill, but decided to help James.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Eason, can you sneak Amelia out of Erebus?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sorry, Amelia is our last card. I can't let her go."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Eason's refusal, Carson said nothing, just forced a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't you think using a woman as a shield is dishonorable?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It is, but Carson, in a life-or-death situation, who cares about honor?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eason advised Carson to prioritize Erebus, then hung up and blocked signals again.</span></p></div>
