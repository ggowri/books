        <h1>Chapter 1963 Never See Each Other Again</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Edith was reluctant to trust Anthony with the lawsuit, but now, the plagiarist had made her on the news. The public took the plagiarist's side. Many netizens who didn't know the truth criticized Edith for being a plagiarist and even damaged the Evans family's reputation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Edith didn't want to argue with netizens. She could only hire a lawyer and make the judge's decision public. However, she didn't expect that the lawyers would be unwilling to take her case except for Anthony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She knew that this might be Anthony's trick. After all, he, who was powerful in the legal world, could do that. However, she didn't expose him. After hesitating for a while, she picked up the business card.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"After this lawsuit, I hope we won't meet again," said Edith.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With tearful eyes, Anthony showed a relieved smile. "Don't worry, Ms. Evans. After this lawsuit, I won't see you anymore."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was not that he didn't want to see her, but he didn't have the chance. Anthony just hoped that after he died, Edith could live a happy life and never be upset because of him again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With this in mind, Anthony reluctantly stood up. "During the lawsuit, I'll need you to provide some evidence. So, I'll come to you often. I hope you don't mind."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Edith didn't respond but just nodded. Anthony had no reason to stay here any longer, so he forced himself to turn around and leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at that unbelievably skinny back, Edith suddenly felt that Anthony would die in the near future.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This thought just flashed through her mind. Then, Edith retracted her gaze and focused on the crafts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Anthony needed to collect evidence, he would go to the studio to find Edith openly. He only collected a little each time and spent the rest of the time having dinner or coffee with Edith. Sometimes, he would deliberately stay up until midnight and find an excuse to send Edith home.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Over time, Edith was no longer so resistant to Anthony's approach, but she still hoped that the case would be over quickly. Anthony probably saw her urgency and thought that she hated him, so he sped up the lawsuit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the day of court, Anthony was afraid that he would feel drowsy if he took too much medicine, so he didn't take any. Perhaps because of that, he vomited a lot of blood before the toilet and couldn't stop vomiting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Edith couldn't find Anthony anywhere. She heard from his students that he hadn't come out of the bathroom yet. So, she plucked up her courage, put a sign saying "Under maintenance" at the bathroom door, and walked in to look for him in her high heels.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as she entered, she smelled a strong smell of blood and had a bad feeling. She frowned subconsciously and asked, "Anthony, are you in there?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing her voice, Anthony took out a tissue, covered his mouth, and pressed the toilet. After flushing away the blood, he steadied his trembling voice and replied, "Yes."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he responded, Edith just walked to the toilet cubicle and reached out to knock on the door. Receiving his response, she slowly retracted her hand. "We're going to court. Why are you still staying in the bathroom for so long?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony's face was pale, and blood was oozing from his nose, but he still held on and apologized to Edith, "I'm sorry. I ate wrong food this morning, and my stomach is upset, but don't worry. I won't be late for the court."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Edith stood there for a moment and said, "Hurry up." Then, she walked away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Anthony heard the sound of the high heels going away, he burst into tears. If it were in the past, she would have rushed in regardless of everything if she had sensed something was wrong. But now, she just left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony slowly gave a mocking smile. He deserved it. He had hurt her too deeply back then. It was reasonable for her to treat him indifferently now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony finally took some medicine to control the bleeding and washed his face. He then found his students, changed into a clean suit jacket, pulled himself together, and went to court.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was dressed in a neat suit and a black tie, standing at the lawyer's table, looking radiant. He made the opposing lawyer speechless. This was the first time Edith had seen Anthony like that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Back then, when Anthony chose to study law, Edith took his arm and acted cute, saying that she must be the first to see him go to court for the first time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, before Anthony could even go to court for the first time, he pushed Edith away in a cruel way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Remembering that Anthony kissed other women and slept with them when they were together, Edith was saddened. Even though she found out that it was a misunderstanding many years later, those scenes were nightmares to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Edith was scarred deeply. Even though she fell in love with Jackson later, she was unwilling to be touched by a man. Edith had never told anyone about that. Only she knew how painful it was to have those deep-seated memories.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Anthony said, he won the case easily. Edith posted the result online without any explanation. She just uploaded a picture of the amount of compensation the court had asked the plagiarist to pay and cleared her name.</span></p></div>
