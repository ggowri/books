        <h1>Chapter 1194 Honey, I smoked, I'm sorry</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It's unclear how many cigarettes James had smoked, but eventually he took out his phone and made a call.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zack, who was on standby, saw Mr. Shawn's call and quickly went to a place without surveillance to answer it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sir, I'm still investigating Jonny's purpose for looking for Skender. Recently, Gigi has developed a great deal of trust in me, so I believe I'll be able to find out soon."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zack immediately reported the progress without waiting for Mr. Shawn to ask.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, he felt a bit aggrieved that he had given up his virginity to gain Gigi's trust.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zack could already imagine how angry Jonny would be if he found out that Z had slept with his sister.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But it didn't matter to Zack. He wasn't afraid. He could just marry Gigi since he didn't have a wife anyway.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James was even more troubled when he thought about Jonny's situation, but he controlled his emotions and said coldly:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I am calling you to ask about something else."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What is it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"When you investigated my eldest brother's cause of death, were you sure there was nothing suspicious?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zak frowned slightly as he thought about the clues he had found in his previous investigations.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span> "Sir, the first time I investigated, I asked you if your brother had undergone an autopsy. You said no, and I thought there was too much room for manipulation. So I secretly investigated a few times. I was planning to gather all the evidence before reporting to you, but since you asked, I'll tell you now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The hospital said Mike died of a brain disease, but what I found was that the medicine he took before he died had been switched by someone. However, I haven't found out what medicine was switched yet."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James's face sank. It seemed that Carol didn't lie to him. Who could have killed his elder brother?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, a sharp female voice came from the other end of Zack's phone: "Zack, what are you doing hiding in the stable in broad daylight?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zack was startled and quickly covered his phone, lowering his voice: "Sir, I'll go deal with that shrew first."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James murmured and hung up the phone. When he looked up, he saw a thinly dressed woman silently accompanying him from a distance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was stunned for a moment, then realized that he was still holding a cigarette in his hand. He immediately threw it away, crushed it with his foot, and walked towards her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Honey, I... smoked, I'm sorry."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The towering figure of the man in front of her, apologizing as if he had done something wrong, made Amelia feel amused.</span></p></div>
