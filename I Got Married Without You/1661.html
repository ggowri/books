        <h1>Chapter 1661 Kate’s methods</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul left, and Kate leaned back on the sofa. With her arms crossed and her legs straightened under her high slit dress, she lazily crossed her legs and stared coldly at Elsie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Slap her three times."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The bodyguard obediently raised his hand and slapped Elsie's fair face three times, hard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elsie, who had been slapped three times, brushed off the messy hair stuck to her eyes and glared at Kate, gritting her teeth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What gives you the right to slap me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You framed my son, so why can't I slap you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kate, who knew the whole story and had seen the surveillance footage, couldn't help but notice that Elsie had staged this whole act just to provoke Eva.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I didn't frame him. He got drunk and slept with me on his own."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Break her ribs and then snap her fingers."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ignoring Elsie's shouts and resistance, Kate continued to command the bodyguard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The expressionless bodyguard pulled out a small hammer and aimed it at Kate's ribs, then struck hard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elsie was in so much pain that she couldn't speak, she could only lie on the ground, staring at Kate with her bloodshot eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The elegant and luxurious lady on the sofa casually picked up her coffee and took a sip.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you honestly tell the truth, you won't have to endure this torture anymore. Otherwise, I'll have them continue to torment you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elsie, who had a voice recorder in her pocket, didn't care at all. She smirked and laughed like a maniac.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kate, you forced me to break up with Paul back then using the same methods. I didn't expect that even after so many years, you still only know how to use these tactics. Don't you have any other way?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kate's hand holding the coffee suddenly paused. She slowly raised her eyelashes and coldly stared at Elsie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You dare to bring up the past?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's wrong with me mentioning it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elsie endured the pain, propped herself up on the ground, and slowly stood up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If it weren't for you forcing me to break up with Paul, I would have married him a long time ago."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing Elsie say this, Kate couldn't help but find it extremely ridiculous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was about to reprimand Elsie for seducing James when she was interrupted by </span><span>Elsie's angry roar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even if you kill me today, I won't do things that hurt Paul and leave him in pain like I did in the past!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You just look down on my background, don't you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elsie didn't give Kate a chance to speak. Like a madwoman, she continued to roar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But just because my background isn't good enough, does that mean I don't deserve to have love?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After uttering these words, Elsie suddenly had red eyes and cried softly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's all my fault for being too young back then. Even if I was humiliated by you in every way, I still endured it. But what did I gain from that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Besides saying things that hurt Paul and being forced to leave him, I didn't gain anything. Now that I finally came back and had a chance to reunite with him, you sent people to beat me and forced me to say that he never slept with me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kate, don't you think you're a failure as a mother? You're willing to do anything to cover up your son's crimes. Do you know that by spoiling him like this, he will never take responsibility?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With these words, Elsie not only used Kate's coercion and temptation to confirm Paul's wrongdoing, but also turned it into Kate's fault for spoiling her son.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kate hadn't expected that the girl who had used every means to marry into the Evans Family back then had now become a woman who was deep-thinking, logical, and good at turning the tables.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it weren't for knowing what kind of dirty thoughts Elsie had inside, Kate might have believed her words and doubted her own son's actions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Other parents might have given up in such a situation, but Kate, who had experienced storms, remained as steady as a rock in the face of such tricks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There's no one else here, so you don't have to act anymore. No one will see."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing this, tears suddenly welled up in Elsie's bloodshot eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm not acting. That night, Paul and I really slept together."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she cried and accused, Elsie looked at Kate with an incredibly sincere gaze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"For a woman, it's not something to be proud of to lie about sleeping with a man. I have no reason to lie."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Besides, if I were to lie about something like this, there must be a purpose behind it. I didn't threaten Paul to marry me afterwards, nor did I expose it to the media to tarnish Paul's reputation. I just quietly left. Is that also wrong?"</span></p></div>
