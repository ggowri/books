        <h1>Chapter 1728 I don't believe he is dead</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After they left, Amelia collapsed onto the couch, her eyes lifeless and filled with despair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Holden, I need some time alone," she said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the desolate living room, a faint voice drifted in, carrying both loneliness and a sense of coldness and despair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Holden's gaze fell upon the slightly swollen face, his lips parting as if to say something, but in the end, he remained silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Holden's heavy footsteps gradually faded away, leaving Amelia alone in the spacious house.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was like a gust of wind, floating lightly as if she didn't exist, even her breath was barely there...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After leaning against the couch for a while, she lifted her blurry eyes and looked at the sunset outside the window...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one could empathize with her current feelings, and Amelia wouldn't use her own emotions to manipulate anyone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She just sat there, feeling the pain of losing James in silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn&rsquo;t know how long had passed when the door opened again, and the warm glow of the setting sun poured in from the horizon...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul held Eva's hand and stood at the doorway, looking at Amelia who was crouched in a ball, lost in thought for a long time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the end, Eva let go of Paul's hand and stepped on the light on the ground, walking step by step towards Amelia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Amelia was embraced in warm arms, in that moment, it was as if her soul had been sucked out and she finally had a reaction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She slowly lifted her head from his embrace and saw Eva's worried face and tear-stained eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Amelia, I just found out that I thought James was really just on a business trip. I... I'm sorry..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If she had known earlier, she would have come to accompany Amelia, but Paul only told her the truth now. If it weren't for worrying that Amelia wouldn't understand, Paul would probably have kept it from her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she made her way over, she couldn't help but blame Paul and James for thinking they know everything. She also blamed them for not communicating with their wives, leaving them with no solutions when something goes wrong.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia was overwhelmed with sadness, but when she saw Eva crying uncontrollably, she still reached out her hand and awkwardly hugged Eva back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was too weak to speak, relying on her loved ones for a bit of comfort. Eva knew she needed strength, so she mustered all her energy and hugged her tightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Amelia, it's going to be okay. James is so amazing, he will definitely find a way to save himself. You have to believe in him, you have to trust him..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite struggling to hold back her tears, Eva managed to suppress her trembling voice and gently comforted Amelia like an older sister, softly stroking her back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia, who had already buried herself in darkness, held Eva tightly and buried her head in her neck, crying out loud like a child, with a heart-wrenching pain...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul's eyes turned red as he looked away from Amelia's face and towards the urn on the table. For some reason, just one glance was enough for him to know that it wasn't James inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sound of crying in the living room gradually turned into sobs in the silent stillness. Paul, who had been standing for a long time, lifted his heavy gaze and looked at Amelia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Amelia, since you didn't choose Ryan, I'll be the one to protect you from now on."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia slowly raised her tear-filled eyes and stared blankly at Paul.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you believe he's dead too?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul shook his head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't believe it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James was a master strategist and had a knack for being in control of everything. He refused to believe that James had simply died.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If I don't believe he's dead, he just can't be dead."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul's determination was so powerful in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia's hope deepened, but she didn't respond. She just remained silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She defined James as missing, rather than dead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because she will find him, no matter what, she will find him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With this belief in mind, Amelia slowly clenched her fingers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Outside the villa, Peter was holding Grace and playing with Lego.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Peter didn't hear their conversation, but he could sense it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had long suspected that Mr. Evans was in a precarious situation and seemed to have mentally prepared himself, but he was still very sad.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It's not the sudden sadness of finding out a friend has passed away, but the slow crumbling of the world that brings sorrow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grace was a smart and observant child. When she saw the heavy expressions on the adults' </span><span>faces, she knew something had happened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she quietly played with her Lego, she sneakily glanced up at Peter. "Uncle Peter, is my uncle James, like the strange uncle, gone?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Peter's tall figure stiffened for a moment, then he reached out and touched her head. "No, it's not possible. Your uncle is so powerful, why would he leave?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grace pretended to be nonchalant as she said, &ldquo;Although the strange uncle is quite powerful, but my uncle James is even stronger. He should be fine...'"</span></p></div>
