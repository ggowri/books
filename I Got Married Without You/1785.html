        <h1>Chapter 1785 1-1 Emily was brought back to Erebus</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, Venom brought the Moore father and daughter back to Erebus. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Venom escorted them to the control room, but did not see 1-2</span><span>.</span><span> </span><span>1-1 </span><span>was the only one </span><span>sitting on the sofa, staring at the screen on the control panel, smoking in silence. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Boss, where's 1-2?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All the operators in the control room looked at 1-1</span><span>.</span><span> </span><span>They didn&rsquo;t dare to bring up the incident</span><span> </span><span>whe</span><span>re</span><span> </span><span>1-1 killed 1-2 without hesitation. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They all had numbers embedded on their clothes, indicating a higher level than regular operatives, and they were in a cooperative relationship with 1-1. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, 1-2 was of a higher level than them, yet 1-1 still killed 1-2? </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were well aware that when they encountered conflicting interests like 1-2, 1-1 would also kill them. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As all the operators hesitated whether to leave Erebus, Carson returned. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Venom, James used the chip to control 1-2, threatening the boss with their lives, so 1-2 was shot dead by 1-3." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With just a simple statement, Carson understood what had happened during his absence. Carson broke out in a cold sweat. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>1-2 </span><span>had worked diligently for Erebus for so many years, and in the end, was shot dead by a junior? </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What would be the result of him helping James to kill to the upper area? </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carson raised his pale face, looking at the man sitting in the first place. "Boss, Nick has followed you for so many years. You don't want to find a way to save him, but instead killed him. It really makes me feel disappointed." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carson, as if knowing his own fate, did not hide his feelings and directly rebuked 1-1. For the first time, 1-1 did not act directly, only looked at him expressionlessly. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You asked me before why I didn't let you manage </span><span>Erebus,</span><span> this is the reason." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carson was soft-hearted and attached to emotions, such a person was not suitable to be a leader. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although 1-1 did not act directly against Carson, he still felt aggrieved. He also didn't care about what 1-1 meant, turned around and left, but 1-1 stopped him. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I won't hold you accountable for your mistakes. Bring the Moore father and daughter in."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carson was taken aback, seemingly not expecting 1-1 to let him go. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He turned back, looking at 1-1 who was still smoking. "I thought you would kill me." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>1-1 took the cigarette out of his mouth and exhaled a smoke ring. "I like killing, but I don't kill indiscriminately." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The implication was that he had no choice but to kill Nick. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can't be restricted by James because of Nick.</span><span> </span><span>Only by finding S's founder from James can you take revenge." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These words struck a chord with everyone. The</span><span>y</span><span> slowly relaxed and sat down. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's a pity that 1-2 died, but he died for a reason." After taking another drag of his cigarette, 1-1 sighed, "To achieve great things, there will inevitably be sacrifices." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Carson agreed with 1-1's words, he knew that 1-1 spared him only to stabilize the shaken morale. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If 1-1 killed him at this time, Erebus would be in chaos. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the leader, 1-1 would never allow such a thing to happen. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carson understood this, but did not show it on his face, only nodded to 1-1. "I'll bring the father and daughter in." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emily came in, with her arms crossed and wearing high heels. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She considered herself a great contributor to Erebus, not only providing the list of S members but also revealing the identity of the S leader. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Therefore, after entering, without waiting for 1-1 to speak, she sat directly in the single position opposite the head of the conference table, leaning back in the chair, crossing her legs arrogantly.</span></p></div>
