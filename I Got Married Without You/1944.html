        <h1>Chapter 1944 Alexander and the golden knife</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul's hope could only be placed on Maxwell.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He held him tightly and kept saying, "Maxwell, you mustn't be like your sister. You have to learn more, you know?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Paul, the child is still so young. You're putting too much pressure on him. Being your child is already tiring enough," replied the other person.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul glanced at them and didn't pay them any mind.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He continued whispering into the baby's ear, "When I put you down later, go straight for that world-renowned classic in the middle. Once you grab that book, you'll become the most educated person in the Evans family."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After finishing his words, Paul put the baby down and raised his right hand, making a cheering gesture. "Come on, Maxwell!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxwell, who had been given great expectations by Paul, crawled on the ground like Barbie.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under everyone's nervous and anxious gaze, he slowly crawled towards the edge of the red carpet.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With one hand on the world-renowned classic and the other hand on...</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing the gold beneath Maxwell's little hand, Paul's heart skipped a beat. "Maxwell, don't grab that pile of gold, please..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Maxwell, without hesitation, grabbed the small pile of gold and played with it happily.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He even raised it up and waved at Barbie, who was holding a stack of banknotes, and when Barbie saw it, she also waved the money.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two siblings who got the money were ecstatic, dancing with joy, while Paul was fuming with anger.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Next, it was Amelia and James' baby's turn.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James had no expectations for the child at all.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He took the baby from Amelia's arms and put him directly on the ground.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul squatted beside them, fist clenched, encouraging, "Buzz Lightyear, go grab the money, grab the gold, and become the richest person in the world!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Buzz Lightyear ignored Paul and continued crawling along the carpet.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although he didn't understand what he was doing, he obediently crawled to the edge of the red carpet under the guidance of the adults.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The baby looked around the items on the red carpet.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In his clear eyes, as pure as melting winter snow, he spotted a golden knife.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stared at it for a second and then crawled past the other items on the red carpet, grabbing the knife.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With even more decisiveness than Barbie grabbing the money, he grabbed the knife without any hesitation, then lifted it up and placed it on his chubby thigh. He lowered his little head and began to figure out how to pull it out.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing this scene, Paul was dumbfounded, and the people from the Evans family and the Lawrence family were also stunned, especially Dylan.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't help but squat down and pat the baby's little head, saying, "My little nephew, you're amazing."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Dylan could finish his words, the baby pulled out the knife with a click. Then he raised his plump chin and looked at Dylan, saying one word, "Kill&mdash;" Paul's two children had already been able to speak some fragmented words, but their baby had never spoken.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No matter how they tempted him with snacks or anything else, he just wouldn't speak.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia thought he couldn't speak, but now hearing him say "kill" so clearly, she shivered subconsciously.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It turned out he wasn't unable to speak, but rather uninterested in snacks.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now that he had something he was interested in, he finally spoke to his uncle.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But how could he be interested in a knife like James?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span> Amelia glanced at James, who had his arms crossed and seemed completely indifferent. "Did you put this knife here?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before James could respond, Neil spoke first. "I saw this knife in Mr. Evans' study. It looked shiny and nice, so I..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia's mood was now the same as Paul's.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She silently complained in her heart about what Neil had put there.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, she didn't show it on her face and just gave him a glare.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ignoring her, Neil enthusiastically picked up the baby and placed him on another blanket. "Alright, let's start picking names now."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the small table, there were many crumpled pieces of paper.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each paper had a name chosen by members of the Evans family and the Lawrence family.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each person had put a lot of thought into their chosen name, so no matter which name the baby grabbed, it would be filled with good wishes.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The baby seemed impatient.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as Neil put him down, he reached out and grabbed one directly from the middle.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then he handed it to Neil. After praising him, Neil took the crumpled paper and unfolded it, facing everyone. "Alexander&mdash;"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this somewhat cold name, Amelia's heart trembled even more.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was afraid that he would become another James in the future.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And indeed, her intuition was correct.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From the moment the baby grabbed the knife and chose that name, his life of decisiveness and ruthlessness was destined...</span></p></div>
