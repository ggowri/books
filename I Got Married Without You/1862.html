        <h1>Chapter 1862 The Past grudges</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"At that time, the Wilson family also fell on hard times, accumulating a lot of debt and offending many people."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It can be said that there were many people chasing and pursuing the Wilson family, but Matty single-handedly blocked them all."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"With Matty's protection, no one dared to touch the Wilson family, not even darkness could get close to Sophia."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It wasn't until Matty was forced by his father to marry Zelene and Sophia left in anger that Bernard found an opportunity for revenge."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He led darkness to kill Sophia's entire family and then had his henchmen, instead of Daley, gang-rape Sophia."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"At that time, Bernard didn't have much power and couldn't afford to offend Matty, so after the rape, he framed it as the work of other enemies of the Wilson family."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Matty searched for many years and finally found darkness, but at that time darkness was facing internal conflicts and was disbanded, so Matty couldn't find anyone."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It was later when the S organization appeared that Matty noticed some clues, and it was only many years later that he imitated the S organization and established Erebus to investigate the members of S..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Master Davies explained the grievances between Sophia, Daley, and Matty, he looked up at the calm man across from him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In fact, the one who truly killed Daley was the influential Matty, and Bernard was just the executioner for Zelene."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Perhaps it was because Matty wanted to divorce after the agreement ended, so Zelene simply used him as a scapegoat to get rid of Sophia."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James listened and his face turned cold, anger hidden in his eyes, seemingly blaming Master Davies for not telling him these things earlier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing James so serious, Master Davies instinctively explained, "I didn't tell you all this before because my cousin was also involved in it, and what she did was quite disgraceful."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James sneered, "Disgraceful things should not only refer to Zelene using someone as a scapegoat, but also darkness being disbanded and transformed into S, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The original founder of darkness was Bernard, but now the person in charge was Master Davies. What happened during this period and where did Bernard and the members of darkness go? It was probably the most disgraceful part.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your mind is the most difficult thing for me to control."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, James sat in the light, silent. In Master Davies' eyes, a faint cold smile appeared, followed by </span><span>a</span><span> indifferent voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As for the name change, it starts with my father. My father saved Bernard once before, and out of gratitude, Bernard made him the second-in-command of darkness."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In fact, with my father's background, he didn't need this kind of dark power, but at that time, the Davies family's several brothers caused quite a stir in order to inherit the power."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"At that time, my father needed the support of these forces to help him do something in secret, so he agreed to become the second-in-command of darkness for Bernard."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Later, there must have been a disagreement in the distribution of power, and the two had a conflict. My father then had the idea of overthrowing Bernard and becoming the leader of darkness."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But at that time, the subordinates only obeyed Bernard, as well as Bernard's other son, Bill, so my father could only inject some euthanasia drugs into Bernard's syringe."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But Bill discovered it, and he rallied the members of darkness to hunt down my father."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who would have thought that Bill not only failed to kill my father, but was also killed by my father. </span><span>So</span><span> my father simply killed all the members of darkness who supported Bernard and Bill."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"After that, he formed his own group with his own people, following the model of darkness, and renamed it S. However, he didn't manage it for long before he passed away."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"After his death, several uncles and uncles elected me as the leader of S. Originally, I didn't want to accept..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this point, Master Davies raised his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That year, your mother Ashley was forced to death by your grandfather and Gloria."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The cowardly and timid Clark family, even though they knew she was forced to death, didn't want to get involved, and your father could only be depressed and unhappy."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I stood in front of your mother's grave and swore in my heart that I would strengthen S and eliminate the Leinster family, the Clark family, and the Evans family."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Master Davies closed his eyes slowly, seemingly thinking of something unpleasant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If that year, Nate didn't ride a white horse and gallop past Ashley at the racetrack, then Ashley wouldn't have fallen in love with your father."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Although your father was never my rival, I still hated him to the core, so later I chose to cultivate you because..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Because I am Nate's child, and you want to train me into a sharp and useful weapon, and then use me to eliminate the Leinster family, the Clark family, and the Evans family?"</span></p></div>
