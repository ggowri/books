        <h1>Chapter 6 The Harasser</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Amelia pressed down on her chest, trying to force her heartbeat to slow in fear that it would stop, and struggled to return to her desk.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She wanted to quit as soon as possible. She couldn&rsquo;t bear to see the two of them so happily in love in front of her every day, for her few remaining days on Earth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She was afraid she might even lose it, and walk right up to James in front of everyone at the office, weeping and asking him why he couldn&rsquo;t love her like she loved him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">After she finished writing her resignation letter, she went to ask Lily, who was in charge of the CEO&rsquo;s office, to approve it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Lily never really liked her. She didn&rsquo;t try that hard to convince Amelia to stay, and only said a few words before agreeing to approve her resignation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The whole process would take a month, and Amelia could not leave immediately, so she had to take half a month of annual leave first.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She had worked at Elite International Corporation for five years, and the annual leave she had was 15 days. It would make sense for her to take a break before resigning.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Seeing that Amelia was in such a hurry, Lily couldn't help rolling her eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"I can approve your leave, but as soon as it&rsquo;s over you'd better come back and finish your work before your last day."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Okay," Amelia replied. Then, she picked up her bag and left.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">As she hurried out of the company, she saw Kevin Harris, the president of the Harris Group.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He was a well-known pervert in Arcadia, and he loved to play with women, regardless of whether they wanted to play too.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Amelia was so scared when she saw him walking towards her, a snakelike smile on his face, that she quickly turned around.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">But Kevin was quicker. He grabbed her hand and pulled her into his arms.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Where are you going in such a rush, baby?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He lowered his head, leaned close to Amelia's ear, and gently blew against her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">His warm breath on her ear made her goosebumps rise, and she shivered in disgust.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Amelia pushed Kevin away desperately, but he held her waist tight, unable to move.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"You smell so good..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He pushed his nose into her hair and inhaled deeply, while his hands moved upward to touch her chest.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Amelia pressed down on his hand and said coldly, "Mr. Harris, please behave yourself."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Behave? Why should I?" Kevin said mischievously, nibbling on her earlobe.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Kevin may have looked unassuming, but his words and actions repulsed Amelia to her core.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She turned her head and showed disgust in her eyes. But Kevin didn&rsquo;t care. In fact, it excited him even more.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The more a woman resisted, the more he wanted to conquer her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Kevin lifted her chin with one hand and caressed her cheek with his fingers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Mr. Harris, please. Have some dignity. We hardly know each other." Amelia shook off his hand angrily .</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Kevin first targeted Amelia when she went to deliver documents to the Harris Group a month ago.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Since then, he had often come to the company to harass her under the guise of business.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Whenever he met her, he touched her inappropriately or harassed her with rude words.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Amelia needed this job to earn money, so she couldn&rsquo;t afford to offend Kevin, and so she always endured his harassment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">But now that she was about to leave this company for good, she was no longer afraid of him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Unexpectedly, although she treated him coldly, Kevin was not fazed. He even pinched her face affectionately.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Maybe we aren&rsquo;t close,&rdquo; he hissed. &ldquo;But if you accepted my offer to spend the night with me, we could get to know each other much better."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He was persistent, she gave him that. Amelia suppressed her disgust and pushed his body away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The more she resisted, the tighter his grip on her became. He kissed her hard on her cheek. The feel of his ice-cold lips on her skin almost made Amelia puke.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Just as she was about to punch Kevin in the face, she suddenly heard a voice behind her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"James?"</p></div>
