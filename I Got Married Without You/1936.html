        <h1>Chapter 1936 Who do you love more ?</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking about the pain James went through, Amelia felt her heart ache to the point where she couldn't breathe, and tears streamed down her face.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No wonder he had forced her to sign the divorce agreement, he was being controlled by this thing.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia felt even more devastated, James, this fool, never told her because he didn't want her to worry, he carried it all on his own.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And she, she had lost her memory, even her memories before the age of eighteen, she only remembered the time she loved Ryan, completely forgetting about him, and said hurtful words and did hurtful things.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't know how James managed to say the words, "It's okay if you wake up and don't remember me," but she knew she was a complete idiot for temporarily forgetting him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia desperately wanted to see James, even if she couldn't stand up, she crawled on the ground with her weak hands, her blood flowing down from where the tube had been pulled out, staining her clothes and the floor.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matty's eyes became sore as he watched her stubborn and frail figure on the ground. "Amelia, I'm sorry, give me another chance to make it up to you, let me take you to see James..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew that calling James over would solve the problem, but for Amelia and James, Amelia had to personally go see James in order to bridge the gap caused by her amnesia.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the end, Matty compromised and opened the door, letting Eva in.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Eva's support, Amelia staggered and made her way to James' hospital room. Through the glass, she saw his tall figure turned to the side, and her eyes reddened. She wanted to call his name, but she couldn't because she was too choked up. With Eva's help, she slowly walked up to James.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In James' hopeless gaze, a familiar figure suddenly appeared.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyelashes trembled slightly, but he didn't look up at her.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia, in pain, grabbed the railing of the bed and, with Eva's assistance, slowly squatted down, her body in agony.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James didn't want to look at her, but he still met her gaze.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He saw Amelia's eyes reflecting his pale face, and suddenly he couldn't tell if those eyes, which now only held him, had remembered him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia let go of the railing and instead touched James' hand. When their skin touched, she felt that his hand was colder than hers.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She instinctively covered that hand and tightly held it in her own palm.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man she held onto moved his fingers slightly, his desperate gaze looking at her with disbelief.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She knew that the man who was high and mighty like the stars didn't believe in Buddha, but in order to wake her up, he had fallen from the stars and begged the gods like an ordinary person.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How much did this man named James love her to let go of his pride and kneel in front of Buddha, begging everywhere?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking about how James had kneeled for half a year, Amelia couldn't help but feel heartbroken.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her gaze slowly moved to his knees, and her other hand uncontrollably reached out to touch them. "Does it still hurt?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just one question made James' eyes well up with tears, but he held back and didn't respond. Rather than being angry, it was more like he felt wronged.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As a big man, he couldn't voice this kind of grievance, so he remained silent. Amelia thought he was blaming her and kept apologizing, "I'm sorry, it's all my fault. I forgot about you for a moment and hurt your heart. I'm really sorry..." Hearing her apology, James, who had thought she would lose her memory for many years, finally dared to confirm that she had truly regained her memory.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The despair in his eyes gradually dissipated, replaced by endless grievance.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was because of this overwhelming grievance that he suppressed the impulse to embrace her, pushed away her fingers, turned his body away, and refused to look at her.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at his lonely and proud figure, Amelia was a little scared, but she mustered up the courage and reached out her hand again to touch his back.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Honey, it's my fault. Tell me, what do I need to do for you to forgive me?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying this, she waited for a long time, but didn't get a response from James. Thinking that he didn't plan to acknowledge her, a cold voice suddenly sounded in her ear, "I'm not angry."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia wanted to say something, but before she could speak, the man who had turned his back to her suddenly turned around and grabbed her hand, rubbing it in his palm.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span> "Amelia, I'm asking you, who do you love more, Ryan or me?"</span></p></div>
