        <h1>Chapter 1849: I am on Your Side</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Dylan left, Amelia stayed put, deliberately waiting for Matty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As expected, he came running.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as he arrived, he gave a few instructions to his men in black.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he turned around, Amelia had disappeared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now he found her leaning against the corridor, lost in thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, Matty slowed down his pace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Amelia, are you scared?" He asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's my father. It feels a bit cruel." Amelia admitted, her head down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That man abandoned you and your mother. He's no father of yours," Matty scoffed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I think it's because I'm pregnant. All this doesn't sit well with me," Amelia said, not arguing back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you're uncomfortable, go rest." Matty suggested without noticing anything odd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Where should I go?" Amelia asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As the leader of Erebus, the control room is yours from now on. Rest there."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Good idea. There's a lounge in there. Perfect for a pregnant woman like me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matty glanced at her belly. He didn't want Amelia to have James's baby, but...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had no choice but to accept it. As long as Amelia was part of The Lawrence Family, he could find a way to guide the child, no matter who the father was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matty told Amelia to go to the control room and she went without hesitation. He had to leave for a while but told her to rest well. He would return to grant her full access once he finished his business.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once he left, Amelia's face darkened, her expression unreadable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, Dylan arrived with a bunch of snacks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Take your pick, they're all spicy," he said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I just wanted to talk to you," Amelia replied as she accepted the snacks and closed the door. She turned to face him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What do you want to know?" Dylan asked, taking a deep breath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I want to know what you know." Amelia replied after putting the snacks aside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"All I know is that James is our partner in Erebus."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dylan didn't want to say more and Amelia didn't push him. She just lowered her gaze to her belly. "Dylan, I've been an orphan all my life. I don't want my child to grow up without a father like I did."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dylan felt a pang in his heart. He sensed the hardships Amelia must have faced. But he had been nurtured by Matty since childhood. Was he supposed to betray him now?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dylan, you don't have to tell me the truth. But I hope we can be honest siblings, without secrets or false pretenses," she said calmly after a pause.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dylan clenched his fists but remained silent, not daring to look at her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I felt good coming back to this family when I found out you were part of it." Amelia added, looking at Dylan who remained silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dylan was polite, graceful, respectful towards women. Who wouldn't want a brother like him? She liked all three brothers of The Lawrence Family. Regardless of the truth, she saw them as her family because they provided the warmth she craved for.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dylan couldn't look at Amelia's earnest eyes without feeling guilty. But he managed to look away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia knew the truth from Dylan's reaction. She didn't know why but it was enough for now. She could find out the rest later.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Amelia dropped the subject.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dylan, thanks for the snacks. I'll eat and rest for a while. You can leave now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She let go of the issue and Dylan thought he'd be relieved. But instead, he felt shackled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dylan wasn't normally indecisive. He could make decisions quickly depending on where his heart leaned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, he turned to look at Amelia, her face calm and sweet. "I'm going to the surveillance room to find Matty. Hide and listen. Whatever you decide to do afterwards, I am on your side."</span></p></div>
