        <h1>Chapter 1863 Reaping the benefits</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James interrupted Master Davies, who was deeply immersed in his memories. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He lifted his gaze and stared into the eyes of the man opposite him, eyes that seemed to see through everything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's right, at that time, I thought that using you as a weapon to eliminate the Clark family, the Leinster family, and the Evans family would be more satisfying than doing it myself, especially since they are all your relatives."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Matty was ruthless, then Master Davies was venomous. He patiently strategized for years just to set up this chessboard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"At the age of seven, when I was beaten to the brink of death, you extended a helping hand and pulled me out. I thought it was redemption, but it turned out to be all part of your plan."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though James had already suspected being used, he still felt hurt, and his </span><span>disappointment was evident in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Throughout his life, his father didn't love him, his mother died early, and his stepmother abused him. Even his grandfather only saw him as useful...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, at the age of seven, when Master Davies held him, covered in blood, he whispered in his ear, "Don't be afraid, I'll be here for you, and everything will be alright."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that time, he truly believed that Master Davies was his redemption, his lifeline on the path of growth, and a caring godfather.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, in this moment, before winter arrived, the former Master Davies, like a ghost, turned into frost, forever frozen in his heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Master Davies noticed the change in James's eyes, but he seemed to have already anticipated this outcome and did not feel regretful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"To be honest, seeing you destroy the Leinster family and lead the Evans family against the Clark family is quite satisfying. </span><span>However</span><span>..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Master Davies paused and looked at James, who appeared lonely and desolate on the other side.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The game I set up may have eliminated the Leinster family, but the Clark family and the Evans family are still there..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There's no need to hide anymore when it has come to this point," James interrupted, his chin raised, urging Master Davies to continue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're right, even if I didn't say anything, you would have found out. So, it's better for me to tell you the answer."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James suppressed his feelings of disappointment and leaned back on the sofa, waiting for Master Davies to continue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Evans family, as we both know, is exceptional. I was thinking, without you, they wouldn't last long, would they?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Coincidentally, that's when Matty intervened."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I thought, if you died in Erebus, I wouldn't be implicated, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Master Davies's voice sounded as if he was discussing something ordinary, indifferent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But to James, it felt chilling in his ears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, you've known all along who the founder of Erebus was, and you were willing to sacrifice so many members just to send me to my death."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Master Davies waved his hand, dismissing this claim.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"At first, I truly believed that Erebus was an organization formed by the elimination of the cancerous elements within S, united together."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But when they started massacring members of S, I remembered darkness, and I guessed that Matty was the mastermind."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I also considered directly confronting Matty with S, but..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Master Davies couldn't bring himself to say it, but James didn't give him any face or room to hide.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But your father participated in the gang rape, and your cousin was the mastermind behind Matty's hatred."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You were afraid that if Matty found out, he would seek revenge on you and the Davies family, so you didn't dare reveal your identity and confront Matty directly."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James had figured out everything, and Master Davies no longer concealed it, simply nodding in acknowledgment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Actually, if you hadn't mentioned leaving S, I wouldn't have used your trust in me to send you to Erebus."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Master Davies knew that with James's personality, once he entered Erebus and discovered the mastermind, he would undoubtedly kill them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By using James's hand to secretly eliminate Matty, he could forever hide in the shadows without being implicated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If James failed to kill Matty and perished in Erebus, the Evans family, without James, would be defeated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Whichever way it went, it was advantageous for him. How could Master Davies not sit back and watch, reaping the benefits?</span></p></div>
