        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She also remembered their last dinner. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James looked at the determined Amelia and didn't refuse anymore. "Alright, let's go together," he said. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia reached out and held onto his strong arm. "Honey, let's go home." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James put his arm around her waist and supported her belly as they walked into the Blue Bay Island. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing the two of them return safely, Frank felt relieved. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was overjoyed and asked the chef to prepare a feast, and sent someone to pick up Grace from school. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia hadn't seen Grace in a long time and missed her dearly, but also felt guilty. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia asked if Grace had cried. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Frank said that Neil and George were there to accompany and comfort her, so she didn't have time to cry. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But there were a few times when she woke up crying at night, and he managed to soothe her back to sleep. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing that Grace had cried a few times made Amelia feel even worse. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Frank quickly reassured her, saying that Grace was only mad at her uncle. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia asked for the reason, and Frank explained that James had come back recently but left before Grace came home from school, which made her very angry. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She swore not to talk to her uncle when he came back. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia found it amusing to see James' face turn dark and comforted him, saying that Grace was just a child and would forget about it. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, when Grace came back from school, she really ignored James. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James bought many gifts to appease her, but it was useless. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grace had grown a bit and became stubborn. James got fed up and stopped paying attention to her. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But when James ignored her, Grace became uncomfortable. During dinner, she stole glances at him several times with her big round eyes. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The last time, he caught her in the act, and the little girl felt embarrassed and quickly </span><span>buried her head in her food. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James curved his lips, picked up a golden spoon, scooped a small bowl of sweet soup, and placed it in front of Grace, gently pushing it towards her. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't say anything, but this gesture warmed Grace's heart. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was so happy that she jumped off her chair and wanted to hug him. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, her fingers were stopped before they could touch his clothes. "Grace, have you forgotten what I said?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only her aunt could touch him, no one else... </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grace would never forget this ironclad rule. But... </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grace walked up to Amelia and raised her small hand to touch her protruding belly. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"When my little brother or sister is born, can't I touch you either?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James raised an eyebrow nonchalantly. "Boys can, girls can't." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"..." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grace had never been so speechless before. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She rolled her eyes and touched Amelia's belly again. "Hey, little baby, you better be a boy, otherwise, your dad won't let you touch him..." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia laughed and pinched Grace's cheek. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grace raised her head and leaned on Amelia's belly, whispering softly, "Little baby, come out soon and help me teach your dad a lesson. It would be great if you could poop on him..." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she spoke, Grace couldn't help but laugh, as if she could already see James' expression of disgust. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man sitting at the dining table, stirring the chicken soup with a small spoon, didn't mind what Grace said. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He just looked at them with a side glance and felt that everything was beautiful. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After the meal, Amelia stayed with Grace for a while until she fell asleep before going to the study to find James. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Honey, what are you busy with?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man who was adjusting the chip system quickly closed his computer when he saw her enter and casually looked at Amelia. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm handling some work. Is Grace asleep?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia nodded lightly. "She had a long day at school and was jumping around in the pile of gifts when she came back. She's exhausted and fell asleep after talking to me for a while." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man stood up and supported Amelia, sitting on the small sofa nearby. "Since she's asleep, you should rest too. Don't overwork yourself." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia agreed and reached out to hold James' arm, leaning her head on his shoulder. She softly said, "There's something I want to discuss with you." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man being leaned on raised his finger and gently touched her hair with affection. "You don't need to discuss or ask for my permission for anything you want to say or do." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia knew that he loved her too much, which was why he felt that he didn't need to discuss anything with her. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Amelia wanted to respect him. "It's still better to discuss with you," she said.</span></p></div>
