        <h1>Chapter 1680 James allocated shares</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, the elevator doors opened and James stepped forward towards the CEO's office. Paul, still standing in place, faintly heard a cold voice drifting in from outside the elevator.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No changing the name!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Such an unpleasant name, and he couldn't even change it? Paul regretted his decision and wished he hadn't opened his mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul, fearing he would be beaten up by Eva if he went back, chased after James like a madman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"James, this name is just too awful. Please, I beg you, change it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James didn't even turn his head and replied with a resolute back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The urgent matter James discussed was to announce to everyone that he had reclaimed all the shares and redistributed them. 30% went to Paul, while the remaining four brothers each had 10%, and Amelia had 30%. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sir Evans himself, including his soon-to-be-retired children, only held management options. This distribution signaled that the power in the Evans family was no longer solely in James' hands, but shared among the brothers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"James, why did you give us all your shares?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul, still immersed in the pain of naming, looked at the screen displaying the share distribution and couldn't comprehend it. The other brothers also wore bewildered expressions as they looked at James.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sitting in the main seat, James slowly turned the pen in his hand with distinct knuckles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You have all made contributions to the company, and you deserve a share."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But my brothers have contributed much more than I have, so why am I getting so much?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although the first four brothers wouldn't argue about this, Paul felt guilty himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In the coming period, I will train you to take my position."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This puzzled Paul even more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If I take your position, then where will you go?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James didn't answer this question in front of them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I have my own plans."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Christopher and Sebastian wanted to ask James about his plans, but he raised his hand to stop them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you have any doubts about this distribution, speak up."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Naturally, they had doubts, but no one voiced them. Perhaps, for them, it didn't matter how James distributed the shares. They trusted him. It was because of this trust that James spent a considerable amount of money to buy back all the shares and dissolve the board, handing them over to his brothers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Since you trust me, I trust you too. The shares I've given you don't require any payment. I only need you to do one thing for me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>William, who was far away in Africa, responded through the screen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"James, tell us. Whatever you ask us to do, we will do it for you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James's indifferent gaze shifted to the share distribution on the big screen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You all saw that I gave 30% of the shares to Amelia."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's the shares you bought back with your own money, and you can give them to whoever you want."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian, as the Asia-Pacific region president, spoke up, and the other friends naturally agreed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, James, you can distribute them however you want. We have no objections."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A faint smile appeared on James's lips, but it was tinged with a hint of sadness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Although you have no objections, there are others in the Evans Family. I hope you will protect her in the future and not let her suffer any grievances in the Evans Family."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Protecting Amelia was James's responsibility, so why did he suddenly ask them to protect her? Paul and the other brothers exchanged glances and nervously asked James.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"James, what's going on? It feels like you're leaving us with your last words. It's strange."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James stared at </span><span>him,</span><span> his eyes filled with complex emotions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As long as you answer me, whether you agree or not."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His affairs had always been mysterious, and as younger brothers, they didn't dare to inquire too much.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We will agree and do whatever you ask of us."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing the assurances from his brothers, James's heavy heart gradually eased. After the meeting, Paul followed James to his office.</span></p></div>
