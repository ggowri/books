        <h1>Chapter 1997 James Was Dead</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Alexander grabbed James' hand with trembling hands, as if sensing something, Amelia abruptly looked up and cast a glance. Then, she crawled to Alexander like a madwoman, her hair disheveled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tears still eluded her. As her resolute gaze settled on the frozen, rigid, pallid hand, she frantically used her bloodstained hands to uncover James' body from the snow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the depths of the mountains, the snow was even more plentiful than outside, burying James layer by layer. While striving to unearth him from the snow, Amelia noticed that his facial features were masked by blood. The bloodstains, merging with the snow, adorned his peerless face, and all vestiges of warmth had vanished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander stared in disbelief at the motionless James and collapsed backward. His mind went blank. In an instant, it was as if he had witnessed the fall of a tree with a tremendous crash, bringing boundless darkness over his whole world.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, Amelia said calmly, "Help me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander slowly came back to his senses and glanced at her bloodshot eyes, which revealed not her sorrow but her doubt about James' passing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Therefore, Amelia, at that moment, hugged James and rubbed his hands and face, trying to use her own warmth to wake up the man who had been frozen stiff.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander also thought that James was just chilled. Mirroring Amelia's actions, Alexander held up James' legs and took off his hard shoes before lifting his clothes and putting them on his abdomen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While pressing the warmth of his abdomen against the icy soles of James' feet, Alexander swiftly rolled up James' trouser legs, vigorously rubbed his palms together to kindle heat, and tenderly massaged James' skin, up and down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia applied her palms to melt the snow on James' cheeks. Hopeful of saving him, she tirelessly caressed his cheeks again and again with all her strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Honey, you asked me to go back and wait for you, and I did obediently. But why didn't you come back?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, if you wake up and follow me back, I will forgive you for leaving without informing me today. Otherwise, I will never let you off."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leaning on her arms, James didn't act the same as before. Once, after waking up from his unconscious state, he embraced her, nuzzled into the curve of her neck, and gently touched her neck with his prominent nose while whispering in her ear, "Honey, I'm fine. Don't worry."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia wished so much that her strokes and massages would rouse him, as they always did. However, after a long time, James still had his eyes tightly closed without breathing, like a lifeless man, which broke her heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nevertheless, Amelia remained reluctant to accept the idea that James, who had always been there for her, would die without a farewell. In her mind, she imagined James lying in the hospital, whispering "I love you" to her before he left her in her sobs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He should never have been in this condition, resembling a person forsaken by the world. Enduring the agony of bleeding and clutching onto a dead wood, he traversed a snowy path and ultimately perished alone in the mountains. In his last moments, there was no one by his side. He quietly faced the relentless snowfall and closed his starry eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unwilling to believe it, Amelia grabbed James' hand, which was as cold as if it was taken out of an ice cellar, and placed it against her cheek. She longed to cover her face with his palm, but his frozen fingers remained rigid and unable to cover it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She simply gave up. After lowering his hand, she took hold of his stiff, icy body, continuing to rub it with all her remaining strength vigorously. Despite her exhaustion, she resolved to expend every ounce of energy to provide him with warmth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unexpectedly, someone said, "Amelia, once he's lifeless and rigid, there's no hope for survival. Just let go."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With bloodshot eyes, everyone around watched Amelia and Alexander massaging James' body like crazy. They knew that Amelia and Alexander desired to save James. However, an hour later, James still had no response. What did this mean?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From childhood to adulthood, James had fought against Dominic, Gloria, Master, the directors of the Evans Group, and later, Matty. He had always shown resourcefulness and courage, establishing himself as a formidable figure. However, the only adversary that he could never defeat was the inevitability of death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were a step too late. In spite of their extraordinary abilities, they had great difficulty in extricating a man who was bleeding from all his features, much less a corpse already stiffened.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blocking out the voices of others, Amelia stubbornly pressed her cheek against James'. She planned to use her own warmth to restore James' body temperature to a normal level. However, the moment she felt coldness at all, it finally dawned on her that her beloved James was truly dead.</span></p></div>
