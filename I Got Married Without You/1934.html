        <h1>Chapter 1934 Stimulation</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once Amelia confirmed that her granddaughter was referring to her, she felt a bit annoyed.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It had been difficult enough for her to accept that she had a husband and children, and now there was a grandfather too.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was giving her a headache...</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Amelia raise her hand to her forehead, Eva became worried. "She's not ready for any more stimulation. If you want to help her regain her memory, let her adjust first and then try again."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matty understood and nodded, but instead of leaving, he leaned on his cane and walked into the hospital room. "I know she can't handle any stimulation right now, but Amelia, James doesn't have time to wait."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva's heart skipped a beat, afraid that Matty would say something provocative and cause Amelia to faint again.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wanted to step forward and stop him, but Matty beat her to it and spoke first. "Could you please step outside for a moment and let me talk to Amelia? Is that alright?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matty used a polite approach, leaving Eva with no choice.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was quickly escorted out by Matty's people, and even though she was still worried, all she could do was watch through the glass of the hospital room.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under Amelia's bewildered gaze, Matty walked to the bedside, pulled out a nearby chair, and slowly sat down.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After glancing at her, his gaze fell on the baby. "I never thought I would see your child before I died. It's a consolation for me."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia didn't understand what the old man was saying. She was just on guard. She held the baby, not remembering anything the old man had done to her.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But seeing how scared Eva was of him, she guessed that this so-called grandfather wasn't a good person.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matty saw the wariness in her eyes and smiled helplessly. "You may have lost your memory, but you're still so guarded. It's just that with your stubbornness, how come you can't remember James?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia detected the sarcasm in his words and her voice turned cold. "Stubbornness is innate, and memory is not something I can control. If you mock me for it, you're mixing </span><span>things up."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matty laughed. "I'm not mocking you. I'm mocking James. He sacrificed everything for you, but what he got in return was you forgetting about him. It's just so frustrating for me."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia didn't understand. "I forgot about him, but how does that have anything to do with frustrating you?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matty put down his cane and rested his elbows on his knees, leaning forward slightly. He stared into Amelia's confused eyes. "James is my enemy. I wish he were dead. So, to achieve that goal, I used you to hurt him. But without your memory, you turned against me. Now that you've forgotten James, it's like we're on the same side. We can work together to kill James. When he's dead, won't that be satisfying for me?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia's heart skipped a beat, and then she looked at Matty with disbelief. "I may have lost my memory, but I'm not crazy. How could I do something so harmful? It's impossible."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matty raised an eyebrow. "When you used my power to kill your biological father and half-sister, you were even more ruthless than me. How come now, after losing your memory, you're too afraid to harm anyone?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia found his words absurd. "That's impossible. I'm an orphan. I don't even know who my biological parents are. How could I have used your influence to kill them?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matty chuckled. "The more impossible something seems, the more possible it is. Just like you now, you've lost your memory and don't remember anything. For me, that's also an impossible thing, isn't it?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia's head felt like it was about to explode from all these words.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was in pain. "I don't know what you're talking about. I don't want to hear about these things anymore. I don't remember, so let me forget. Don't force me..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she held her head in pain, Amelia's face turned pale.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matty felt sorry for her and hesitated for a moment, but after a brief silence, he mustered up the courage to speak again. "I'm not forcing you. I just came to share some good news with you."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matty paused for a moment, then revealed a cruel and bloodthirsty smile, like a victorious king. "You don't know yet, do you? James has a chip with a virus in his brain. When it erupts one day, he will die. How wonderful..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These words stimulated Amelia's brain, causing it to feel like it was about to explode.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was in excruciating pain, holding her head and curling up, but the intense movement caused her whole body to ache.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Pain... it hurts... help me..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia reached out her hand, wanting Matty to help alleviate her pain, but Matty suddenly hugged the baby and lifted him up in front of Amelia.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Amelia, this is James' child. We can't keep him. Let's just kill him!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tears poured out of her eyes like a broken dam, but because her brain was being stimulated, her body went out of control and her eyes rolled back.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing her suffering and convulsing, Matty's face turned pale with fright.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He quickly put down the baby and tried to save Amelia, but he saw her clutching her </span><span>chest and suddenly spitting out blood, then she completely fainted...</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Matty!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I told you not to stimulate her!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why did you still do this?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Outside the door, Eva's voice roared with anger, but Matty ignored her and urged Moore, who was waiting in the hospital room, to quickly save Amelia.</span></p></div>
