        <h1>Chapter 1600 A voice recorder</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stella stared at Karen, her eyes red and filled with anger. "You're my aunt, and yet you sent someone to rape me and blamed it on Erin."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When she found out that Bart was the one who sent the money, she suspected it was Karen, but deep down she believed it was Bart acting on his own. She never expected Karen's own son to accuse her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stella collapsed onto the couch...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It turned out it was her aunt who orchestrated it, not Erin...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she had plotted for ten years out of resentment towards Erin, and finally succeeded in making Erin fall in love with her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She hurt him, tormented him, drove him crazy, and forced him to die willingly when he found out she didn't truly love him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thought of Erin slowly bleeding to death while she callously refused to help him, her heart couldn't bear it and started to ache.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All the pent-up emotions she had been suppressing suddenly broke free, tears streaming down her face</span><span>. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stella didn&rsquo;t know</span><span> </span><span>how to face Karen.</span><span> </span><span>She could only grasp Karen's skirt and repeatedly ask, "Why did you do this</span><span>?</span><span> </span><span>W</span><span>hy</span><span>?!</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing this, Karen quickly reached out to help her up. "Stella, calm down. It was Mike who misunderstood."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then Karen turned her head fiercely and glared at Mike. "Tell your cousin that you misunderstood</span><span> me.</span><span> </span><span>S</span><span>top </span><span>falsely accusing me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Mike didn't follow Karen's words as he usually would. Instead, he exposed everything she had done in the past. "Bart used this incident to blackmail you for money, and in the end, you gave him millions. After that, he kept coming to you for money, but unfortunately, he died right after receiving the last payment."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was clearly reminding Stella that Bart was silenced by Karen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How could Stella not understand? She suddenly realized that Erin wasn't responsible for these things, it was her own aunt. She was overwhelmed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Still, she couldn&rsquo;t believe that her aunt had s</span><span>o </span><span>many people rape her</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stella couldn't believe it, but she had to believe it</span><span>.</span><span> </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>S</span><span>taring </span><span>at Karen intently</span><span>, she snapped,</span><span> </span><span>"</span><span>T</span><span>ell me the truth. Why did you do this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Karen, who had been betrayed by her own son to this extent, felt powerless and slumped onto the couch. When she looked up at Stella, the acting on her face disappeared, leaving only coldness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll tell you the truth, but will you still help Mike?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stella smirked inwardly but pretended to nod lightly, just like before. "Aunt, I know you must have had no choice. No matter how cruel the truth is, in my heart, you are still the aunt who raised me, who took care of me. I will </span><span>always be grateful</span><span>."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before, Stella had always felt abandoned by her relatives after her parents died, but her aunt never gave up on her. She treated her like her own daughter from childhood. Stella was always grateful for that. So, no matter what Karen said, she would listen. </span><span>When Stella was y</span><span>oung</span><span>, she even told Karen</span><span> </span><span>that she would do anything for her if she needed it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Karen was well aware of this and also knew that if she didn't tell Stella now, Stella would find out </span><span>about it </span><span>eventually. When Stella found out herself, it would be a pile of evidence. If Stella, in her emotional state, handed the evidence over to the police, Karen </span><span>would </span><span>have </span><span>no</span><span> </span><span>way out</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, if she revealed what happened back then and soothed Stella with kind words, once Stella's anger subsided, she could erase all the remaining traces with the help of others. Even if Stella found out</span><span> about it</span><span>, </span><span>there would be nothing she could do about it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At most, she would hate her or cut ties with her, but with Stella's respect and care for her, she wouldn't seek revenge. And the biggest mistake in this whole situation was still Erin. If Stella wanted to hate someone, she should hate Erin</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Karen never anticipated that Stella had a voice recorder in her bag. She had been recording everything from the beginning. As long as Karen revealed these things, even if she escaped to the ends of the earth, she wouldn't be able to escape from Stella's grasp.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aunt, please tell me..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sitting on the floor, Stella grabbed Karen's skirt, looking pitifully at Karen, who was leaning against the couch with her arms crossed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Karen decided to use a delaying tactic to calm Stella down. After seeing Stella in this state, she slowly began to speak...</span></p></div>
