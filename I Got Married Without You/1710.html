        <h1>Chapter 1710 I need to leave for a while</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After leaving the Lawrence family, Amelia headed straight for James' car. As soon as she got in, she threw herself into James' arms, hugging his waist and pressing against his chest, inhaling the scent of cold cedar that emanated from him, slowly relaxing her body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Honey, ever since Dylan saw me from behind, he has started to suspect me," Amelia said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James casually wrapped his arm around her waist and picked her up from the seat next to him, sitting her on his lap.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry," he said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those few words calmed Amelia's fearful heart from being exposed. She tilted her chin up, and James happened to lower his head, their lips meeting. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man curled his lips, revealing a faint smile, while Amelia smiled with her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James held Amelia, kissing her for a while before resting his forehead against hers, softly asking, "Why did Matty look for you? What was the main reason?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't believe that Matty was solely interested in the construction work; there had to be another motive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia caught her breath and replied in a soft voice, "He came to find out about my background."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James paused for a few seconds, then came back to his senses. "Speaking of which, Dylan's eyes... they resemble yours a bit," he said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This surprised Amelia. "You're not suggesting that my mother is a child of the Lawrence family who was lost, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James's expression changed slightly. "It's not impossible."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia looked incredulous. "The Lawrence family is nearly as influential as your family. If my mother really was their child, wouldn't they have found out without needing to approach me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James didn't express his opinion on this matter. "Besides investigating your background, have they done anything to you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia shook her head. "Matty only told me about his first love story, and Dylan just suspected that I was your wife. Nothing more."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James furrowed his brow, deep in thought, while Amelia held onto his neck and said, "Honey, it seems like the Lawrence family doesn't have any major hostility towards me. They just want to ask about my background."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James didn't care about anything else as long as the other party wouldn't harm Amelia. "Regardless of their intentions, stay on guard."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't know if the people coming to find Amelia were good or bad, but he would never allow even the slightest danger to her. He was determined to ensure Amelia's absolute safety.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feeling his concern, Amelia kissed his forehead and reassured him, "Don't worry, honey. Matty doesn't seem like someone who is looking for relatives. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He probably just thought Skender resembled someone he knew and used this project as an excuse to meet her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After seeing her and investigating a little, he realized it wasn't the case and didn't pay it much attention."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James nodded slightly but still cautioned Amelia, "In any case, you can't let your guard down."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the last matter settled, he had to fulfill his mission.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The only thing he was worried about was Amelia's safety, so he repeatedly reminded her to be careful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia was unaware that James was about to leave, so she casually responded with an "mm" and rubbed her eyes. "Honey, I'll take off my colored contacts first. They're uncomfortable."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Reluctantly, James let go of Amelia and picked up her makeup bag from the side, handing it to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Drive slowly," he said to the driver, but his eyes never left Amelia. "Be careful, don't hurt your eyes."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia acknowledged and quickly took off her colored contacts, then used makeup remover to clean her face, revealing a fair and radiant complexion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Amelia return to her natural appearance, James's gaze darkened. If Amelia had shown her true face to Matty earlier, it would have been... he couldn't bear to think about it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, the Lawrence family was a prestigious European family. If Amelia was truly their lost granddaughter, they would openly come to claim her, and he wouldn't be able to stop it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It's not that he didn't want Amelia to find her family; he just didn't want her to spend too much time in Europe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't want to be separated from her, nor did he want to share Amelia with anyone, even her own relatives.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the current situation forced them to be apart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking about this, James's expression became serious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia noticed and put down the wet towel she was using to wipe her face, turning her head to ask him, "Honey, what's wrong?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James reached out, picked her up again, placed her on his lap, and held her tightly. "Amelia, I... need to leave for a while."</span></p></div>
