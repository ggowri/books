        <h1>Chapter 1982 Worry</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that time, Grace was still in the early stages of love when she heard that Phil was going to the same school as her, and couldn't help but be happy. "I really didn't take your textbook, but my friends may have taken it. As I go to school tomorrow, I'll have them hand it over to you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grace, like Alexander, was a leader in school, but she did not bully her classmates. She was just too popular. Girls listened to her commands, while boys admired her and surrounded her all day long. Only Phil studied honestly, and occasionally got bullied by Grace to the point of wanting to strangle her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was because Grace had been spoiled since childhood, which led to Grace being very domineering in school from childhood to adulthood. However, at this time, Phil still matured a bit late and didn't see his thoughts clearly, so he was a bit annoyed with Grace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander bid farewell to his elders one by one, then sat in the car. As the door closed, the usually indifferent boy suddenly paused. After a few seconds of silence, Alexander got out of the car and reached out to hug Amelia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom, take care of yourself."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia was actively embraced by Alexander. She was going to cry. Then, Amelia lifted her fingers and placed them on Alexander's head, reluctant to part. She gently caressed him and said, "Alexander, your father and I are waiting for you coming back."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander nestled in her arms, nodded, then hugged her tightly before releasing her and turning sideways toward James. "Father, as I finish my studies and come back, you will definitely not be able to beat me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James smiled and didn't say anything. He just lifted his big palm and patted his shoulder. "Remember, conceited people are easily stabbed. You need to learn to be compatible with others."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander remembered James' advice in his heart. "I will."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James withdrew his palm and took out a golden knife with an "S" engraved on it from his waist, handing it to him. "At the birthday party, you caught this knife, and now I'm officially giving it to you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander had heard of James' story from Peter and had long known that Wesley Shawn, who led thousands of members, had subdued many people with a golden knife.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, James handing the knife to Alexander was a sign of trust in him and a hope that he had the ability to protect himself. Alexander thanked James for his unspoken love and respectfully took it with both hands. "Thank you, Father."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James didn't say much anymore. Then, he headed toward the car and raised his chin. "Let's go. Don't turn back."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Children who grew up had to leave their homes, and even if parents were reluctant to part ways, they must learn to let go.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander held the knife and stepped forward, awkwardly hugging James before turning around and getting into the car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was probably shy, closing the door and windows very quickly. Even Amelia didn't have time to give him any more advice. Alexander let Peter drive the car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia followed behind for a few steps until she couldn't see the car, then covered her face and cried. If possible, she really didn't want Alexander to be smart so he wouldn't leave her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But there was no such hypothesis. Alexander was a genius, not belonging to his family but to the school, laboratory, and research institution that needed him. Her son was destined not to be an ordinary person.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James grabbed her shoulder, silently providing comfort and strength. Feeling supported, Amelia leaned on his shoulder, and her tears blurred as she gazed at the empty road from afar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James taught Alexander all the techniques of marksmanship, swordsmanship, and skill, but he still felt uneasy, so he asked Peter to follow Alexander to study abroad.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>According to his arrangement, James took Amelia to travel around the world while waiting for Grace to enter college.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They traveled to many places of the world and left their mark on each other, not taking photos but crazily having sex. James once said that only by having sex everywhere could he prove that he had been here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia allowed him to go crazy and also cooperated with him to go crazy. The two of them often wanted each other on ferries, trains, special planes, hotels, or in water.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Being exhausted, James kissed Amelia's sweat-soaked forehead. "Honey, do you want to go see Alexander?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia, whose legs were still hooked around the man's waist, looked at his delicate face in confusion. "Okay. When will we go?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James' fingers slid down from her eyebrows and eyes to her red lips. "Two more times, I'll take you tomorrow."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia shook her head while poking away his fingers. "No, I can't keep up with my physical strength. If we made it again, I could not get out of bed tomorrow."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James smiled and kissed her, "Every time we finish, it's always me holding you out. When did you get out of bed by yourself?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia raised her hand and touched him, who was also sweating profusely. "Sometimes, I really doubt that you have a stainless steel body and don't even know you're tired."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James grabbed her hand, lowered his head, and buried it in her neck. "I'm tired, but I'm afraid I don't have enough time, so..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia's body stiffened, and she quickly reached out to embrace the man who had pressed against her. "No, no. You will always be together with mee. We have plenty of time to do such things."</span></p></div>
