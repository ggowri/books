        <h1>Chapter 1611 Stella’s hopeless situation</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stella was so scared by the scene that she froze in place and didn't dare to approach. Instead, she quickly turned around and ran out of the bathroom. She was like a madwoman, climbing the stairs without even taking the elevator, and ran all the way to the office...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wanted to go back to the office and take a good rest, but when she arrived at the door, she saw Erin in a white suit, arms crossed, leaning against the wall. When Erin saw her, he slightly tilted his head and looked down at her...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stella, I never thought that after ten years, you would still be so charming..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stella suddenly broke down. She crouched down and tightly hugged her arms, tears streaming down her face like beads falling off a thread...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Who would come to rescue her?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one came to rescue Stella. She could only save herself, taking medicine, desperately taking medicine, that was her way of self-help...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought she was a doctor, thinking that this was post-traumatic stress disorder, believing that it would pass after a while and everything would be fine, and Erin would disappear...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But what she didn't expect was that memories of Erin were everywhere, like his shadow, seen everywhere.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She pretended to work as if nothing happened, while peacefully interacting with the imaginary Erin, occasionally even arguing with him...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every time this happened, Stella would think that if Erin were still here, their relationship would probably be like this, flowing smoothly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately, there were no "ifs".</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stella thought she had it under control, until one night she saw Erin sitting in front of her bed, head down, not saying a word...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stella had just finished taking a shower and regardless of whether it was an illusion, she walked straight over and half squatted in front of him, raising her hand to touch his face, "What's wrong with you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Erin felt her touch and slowly lifted his eyelashes, looking at Stella, "You promised to accompany me for a month, but you only spent one day with me..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stella's fingers stiffened, and her eyes, which had shed countless tears, quickly filled with tears at these words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Erin didn't care whether she was crying or not. He just grabbed her wrist and pulled her into his arms, then asked her coldly, "When will you come to accompany me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stella remained silent for a few seconds after hearing this, then reached out and hugged Erin, "Do you want me to come and accompany you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Erin nodded, "I'm so lonely here, Stella, please come and accompany me. I'll be waiting for you..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though he disappeared after saying these words, Stella remained frozen in place, touching the spot where he had sat, feeling the coldness without any warmth. She knew he wasn't real, just a product of her imagination, but Stella still cried uncontrollably...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She realized that it was only when someone truly left that she would understand how heavy the buried love in her heart was and how wildly it grew...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That's how Stella was. She thought she no longer loved Erin, but she never considered that truly letting go of someone meant letting go of all the hate as well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she couldn't do it. She had survived the past ten years by hating Erin, never achieving true release. It was because of that that she was entangled with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stella looked out at the moonlight through the window and remembered what Erin had said before he died. He had wanted her to spend a month with him before letting her go. He had given her a gun with only one bullet...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He did this to tell Stella that if the deadline passed and he didn't let her go, she should shoot him. He was restraining himself with a gun, while also testing Stella to see if she would shoot him in order to escape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Erin lost the bet, or rather, Stella never let him win. </span><span>So</span><span> when he was shot in the heart, he didn't make a sound. He trembled, handed her the key to the handcuffs, and asked her to take Henry and leave...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stella wondered what Erin wanted to say when he grabbed her ankle. Did he want to explain the past? Why didn't he say it in the end? Did he think she no longer loved him and only had Henry in her heart, so it was meaningless to say anything?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stella couldn't find the answer. She just stood up, turned on the tap in the bathtub, and filled it with water. Then she lay down in it...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was said that when water submerges the heart for a long time, suffocation occurs...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Erin asked her to accompany him, and she should have gone to accompany him, so he wouldn't be alone in a foreign country, feeling lonely...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that thought, Stella closed her eyes and slowly sank into the bathtub...</span></p></div>
