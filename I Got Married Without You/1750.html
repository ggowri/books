        <h1>Chapter 1750 How long will you protect Johnny?</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing these questions, Venom casually smiled. "If I remember correctly, the rules for the game area are set by 1-2. You are questioning whether 1-2 broke the rules by revealing the game area's rules to me in advance, so that I could insert Scar in order to win your chips?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>1-1 to 1-3 were the founders of Erebus. To ensure the fairness of the invited players' bets, the rules of the game area were managed by 1-2. Each round had different rules, and only 1-2 knew them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You should be very clear that I am only responsible for transporting the invited players and monitoring the player rooms. I have nothing to do with the game area. Don't talk nonsense in the future, so as not to tarnish 1-2's reputation." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Venom's words hit the mark, he gracefully stepped down the steps. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he passed by 2-9, Cobra slowly raised his eyes to look at him. In that moment of eye contact, it seemed like they reached some kind of agreement. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After the game area closed, the manipulators were free to move around. Venom returned to his residence, took off his mask, and sat down on the sofa. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was a knock on the door from outside. Venom picked up his mask, put it back on, and then opened the door. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A tall figure appeared outside, and after standing at the door for two seconds, the man took a step inside and closed the door. "Cobra, what brings you here?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Venom sat on the sofa, lit a cigarette, and looked at the man who came in without saying a word. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man remained silent, and Venom didn't rush him. He slowly played with the burning cigarette in his hand through the mask... </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a while, the man walked up to him and sat down across from him. He tapped the table, using Morse code to communicate. "I can't speak, so I can only communicate with you this way." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if there were no monitors in the room, there were some things he couldn't say out loud. Venom knew his situation and didn't mind, nodding to indicate that he should continue. "Did you arrange the Scar?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Venom paused with the cigarette between his fingers, and a hint of killing intent appeared in his eyes behind the mask. "So what?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cobra's fingers continued to lightly tap on the table. "I want to know, how long will you protect Johnny?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Venom's eyes darkened again, and he instantly extinguished the cigarette he was playing with. "Why should I tell you?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Faced with Venom's distrust, Cobra hesitated for a few seconds, then directly took off his mask. After seeing who the other person was, Venom furrowed his brow, seemingly surprised that Cobra was the man. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These behind-the-scenes manipulators all had identities on the outside. In order to avoid exposure, they all wore masks when entering and leaving Erebus, and they didn&rsquo;t know each other. They addressed each other based on their assigned numbers. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The closer to 1-1, the higher the level. For example, Venom, 1-4, was the first to join Erebus and is second only to the three founders. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Originally, Venom was a powerful figure in Erebus, but after two new members joined, 2-7 and 2-8, a man and a woman with a list of S&rsquo;s members, they contacted the three founders and pushed him out of the spotlight. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, all Venom could do was transport the invited players and manage the monitoring rooms for the players. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Otherwise, when 2-7 slandered him today, he wouldn't have been so passive that he could only say a harsh word.</span></p></div>
