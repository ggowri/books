        <h1>Chapter 1686 Sharing my good luck with you</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia took Grace and planned to find Eva, but Eva arrived at the door first. The two hadn't seen each other for over a month, but now they coincidentally met at the door and couldn't help but smile at each other.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Back inside the castle, after Frank prepared some food for pregnant women, Amelia took Eva up and down for a few rounds, then extended her hand and gently touched Eva's flat belly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Eva, do you remember what you promised me before?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course, I remember."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Standing, Eva gently touched Amelia's hair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"When I give birth, I'll let you be the godmother."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing this, Amelia raised her head and smiled sweetly at Eva.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm starting to look forward to it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The joy and delight in her eyes were all for Eva, without a trace of pain for her own inability to conceive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She acted well, always hiding her worries in her heart, but Eva could still sense her emotions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Amelia, your child will come soon too."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva sat down, held her hand, and gently patted her hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"When your child is born, I'll also be the godmother."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva amused Amelia, and the heaviness in her heart quickly disappeared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then I'll take your good words, and let you be the godmother of my child as soon as possible."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva extended her fair fingers and tapped Amelia's nose.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sharing my good luck with you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia leaned in closer, her high nose bridge almost touching.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do it a few more times, so I can have more children."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva couldn't help but laugh, tapping Amelia's nose ten times in a row.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's see if you can have ten."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Two is enough, preferably one boy and one girl. Then my life will be complete."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was a loving couple's most common hope, and Eva shared the same sentiment, but she didn't force it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After chatting with Eva for a while, Eva felt tired and Amelia quickly asked her to rest in the guest room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She originally wanted Eva to have a good sleep, but little did she know that Paul couldn't find his wife and rushed to Blue Bay Island.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Amelia, where's my wife?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Paul entered, Amelia looked around, but he didn't even give her a glance, which made her find it amusing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've locked up your wife. If you want to see her, pay me fifty thousand."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without hesitation, Paul took out his phone and prepared to transfer the money, but Amelia stopped him by pressing the screen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>So</span><span> you're actually transferring."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia smiled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I was just joking. Eva is sleeping in the guest room. Maybe you can wait for her to wake up and take her home."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul glanced at the sleeping Eva in the guest room, then went to the kitchen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Amelia, how about tonight Eva and I have dinner at your place?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia had already wanted to invite them for dinner, so when Paul showed interest in their chef, she smiled and nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As long as you don't mind having dinner with James."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm not afraid."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I am!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Eva reached the living room, she quickly interjected upon hearing such a terrifying topic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia put down her phone, propped her forehead with one hand, and looked Eva up and down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why are you so afraid of my husband? He's not a ferocious beast."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking Eva would give a reason, they both said in unison:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He is a ferocious beast!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He is a ferocious beast!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia: ...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I always thought my husband was gentle."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva walked over, picked up her bag from the sofa, and responded to Amelia's words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's only towards you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul nodded in agreement, lowered his head, and kissed Eva's hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Eva, come home with me. I'll hire a good chef to make you a delicious meal."</span></p></div>
