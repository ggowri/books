        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To Elsie's surprise, Paul knew the truth about this matter. Elsie felt a sudden weakness and her body slumped. But she refused to give up, and after a moment, she straightened her back and tried to grab Paul's pants. However, the bodyguard behind her held her down tightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though Elsie was extremely unwilling, she reached out to Paul and said, "Paul, can't you give me another chance because of my love for you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul rolled his eyes and replied, "You don't truly love me. You only love my wealthy background. You've never treated me sincerely since our first love."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though Paul exposed her intentions without mercy, Elsie remained defiant. She pointed her finger at Eva and said, "I don't love you, Eva. Do you truly love him when </span><span>you keep doubting him over and over again?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva looked at Paul and could see a hint of grievance in his eyes, which made her feel guilty. Paul, however, disregarded it and said, "Of course, my wife loves me. It's because she loves me that she can't trust someone like me. I've always promised her to be faithful in the future, but I've never kept my distance from other women. It's my own lack of boundaries that led to her disbelief..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After speaking, Paul lifted his affectionate gaze and looked at the uneasy Eva. "From now on, I will only be faithful to her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing such words from a playboy like Paul, Elsie could hardly believe it. "Paul, you..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before she could finish her words, Paul interrupted her coldly, "Elsie, tell the truth. Maybe you still have a chance to marry Luca. Otherwise, I will ruin your reputation in this circle, and you won't get anything."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luca was Paul's friend who Elsie seduced into bed using some tricks. Elsie thought it was a discreet affair, but she didn't expect Paul to know about it. It terrified Elsie. "How did you find out?" she asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul remained indifferent and said, "I know what kind of person you are."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In other words, he could predict her next move based on her actions. Elsie suddenly understood that Paul would never have acted with her if it wasn't to provoke Eva.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feeling completely defeated, Elsie closed her eyes and asked, "If I confess, can I still be with Luca?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul glanced at her indifferently and said, "That's your business, it has nothing to do with me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In other words, Paul wouldn't tell Luca what kind of person Elsie really was. If he didn't, she still had a chance to marry into a wealthy family. Otherwise, she would have nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul had a firm grip on the thing Elsie cared about the most - her interests. This forced Elsie to consider her options...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elsie, who only cared about her interests and not true emotions, opened her eyes again and looked towards Eva.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"On that night, Paul didn't touch me. It was all a performance orchestrated by me, including the things I said to you later to frame him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Eva heard this, she instinctively looked at Paul and saw that his eyes were red. She suddenly felt a deep sense of pity...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had been trying so hard to prove his innocence just to reassure her, but she had never trusted him. If she had believed him from the beginning when he said there was nothing, they wouldn't have had so many misunderstandings. He wouldn't have had to suffer so much.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After proving his innocence, Paul took out a recording pen from his pocket, placed it next to Elsie's ear, and pressed the play button...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Immediately, Elsie heard her own voice admitting to framing him. Confused, she looked at Paul and asked, "What do you mean?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul smirked and gave a meaningful smile. "I'm just following James' example and giving you a taste of your own medicine."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elsie quickly understood his meaning. "Didn't you just promise to let me be with Luca?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul nodded with a smile. "I promised to let you be with Luca, but you have to serve your time in prison first."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, with a chilling tone, he added, "If he's willing to wait for you to be released, you can still be together."</span></p></div>
