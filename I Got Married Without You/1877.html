        <h1>Chapter 1877 I’ll shoot myself</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James quickly shot and killed one of the black-clad individuals. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he was about to adjust his aim towards the other one, Amelia's body was covered in red dots. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, the gun held by the other black-clad person was pressed against Amelia's temple.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Evans," one of the operators spoke, holding a long gun, as they emerged slowly from the escape pod inside the room. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you comply with 2-5's demand, we will release your wife. Otherwise..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the operator's words fell, the gun pressed against Amelia's head was forcefully tightened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't hurt her!" James exclaimed, his heart racing with fear. Clearly, his concern for Amelia had surpassed his own life. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if Amelia were to suffer the slightest injury, he would be extremely anxious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come at me, but don't touch her," James said, his eyes lacking the decisiveness he had shown when he shot 2-5.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We can spare her, but you must commit suicide in front of us," one of the operators stated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These words struck Amelia like a fatal blow. She gazed at James's handsome face and shook her head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't do something foolish," she pleaded. He had already been injured many times for her sake. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't want him to be so reckless. It would only cause her pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia's clear eyes revealed her love and concern, warming James's heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry, I'll be fine," he reassured her, slowly shifting his gaze away from her affectionate eyes to the three operators.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can apologize, but I cannot commit suicide," James declared. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>During the process of eliminating the cancerous elements in the business world, S organization has indeed done some questionable things. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For example, like how Emelyn dealt with Jessica, sending her off to Myanmar to face her own demise. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Another example is how he handled Kevin, sending him to prison for a lesson. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, since taking over, he has never allowed his members to engage in acts of torture or killing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James admitted that S Organization was guilty, but it did not warrant a death sentence. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, as the leader of S, he knew he had to pay a price no matter what. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was willing to apologize and atone for the sins accumulated by S over the years. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, he had learned from his experiences that actions have consequences.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll fire a shot as an apology, and you release her," James said, raising the gun in his hand and aiming it at his own shoulder. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The tall and upright man didn't even blink his eyes as he pulled the trigger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bang! The deafening sound of the gunshot echoed through the entire corridor and the entire escape pod. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It shattered Amelia's eardrums and her heart. She looked at the man who had been shot but still stood tall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't be afraid," he said, his voice reaching Amelia's ears after a long delay. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In her blurred vision, all she could see was blood. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The dark red blood flowed from James's shoulder, staining his white shirt beneath his </span><span>suit jacket. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each drop of blood that fell from his shirt hammered against Amelia's heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia's tears gushed out along with the falling blood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"James!" she cried out, struggling desperately against the grip of the black-clad person restraining her. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she was completely immobilized.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia realized at that moment that her existence was James's fatal weakness. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James saw the self-blame in her eyes, but he only shook his head to comfort her. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He quickly changed the direction of his gun and, taking advantage of the moment when the three operators were distracted, shot and killed one of them with a single bullet to the head. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He then swiftly pulled out a golden knife and threw it at one of the remaining operators, aiming for their forehead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Within a span of five seconds, James killed two people. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The remaining two operators quickly regained their composure and aimed their guns at Amelia. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But before they could pull the triggers, James had already crossed the bulletproof glass door and embraced Amelia, shielding her from harm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two bullets missed their mark and hit the wall instead. The two operators' faces turned pale, but they attempted to shoot again. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Matty had already killed them both.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the two operators fell to the ground, Matty holstered his gun and turned to look at the tightly embraced couple.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When his gaze fell upon James's shoulder, his brows furrowed slightly. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hadn't expected James to be so daring. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With his marksmanship, he could have killed those individuals without firing that shot. But he did it as an apology.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matty's initial disdainful gaze gradually transformed into admiration. It was clear that a man like James was deserving of Amelia's love.</span></p></div>
