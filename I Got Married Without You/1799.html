        <h1>Chapter 1799 Why Sophia sent Sumasa away?</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Carson brought the Moore father and daughter back, he knew that Amelia was not dead and wanted to bring the news to James, but he did not have the authority to go to the biochemistry area. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The biochemistry area was not within his jurisdiction, nor did it involve his interests. In the past, he had not planted any hands, which led to the current passive situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, Carson also learned from other operatives that James was the leader of S, and the other operatives in Erebus hoped that Matty would kill James. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Matty had not killed James yet, only keeping him locked up in the biochemistry area, and Dylan even notified the doctor to treat James. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They said that keeping James was to extract the founder of S from him, a reason that could convince other operatives, but not Carson.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>According to reason, the most reasonable way to extract the founder from James would be to use severe torture. So why send a doctor to treat him? </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carson felt that this was not Matty's usual style. He usually personally punished the members of S he captured, especially the leader of S.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carson felt that Matty kept James for other reasons, but what those reasons were, he did not know.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While Carson was sorting out his thoughts, he received a call from Dylan, asking him to meet Matty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After hanging up the phone, he was puzzled. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Normally, for the sake of secrecy, he would not have any private dealings, only handling Erebus affairs. What was going on this time that he was asked to go to Arcadia to meet?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carson couldn't understand, but he still put aside his current affairs and went to Arcadia. Following the evasion method provided by Dylan, he quietly entered the Lawrence family's backyard and then went to Matty's study.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, Matty was making coffee. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he saw Carson come in, he waved at him, motioning for him to sit on the sofa and poured him a cup of coffee. "I called you here to ask you something."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After sitting down, Carson took the coffee handed to him by Matty and said, "Boss, what do you want to ask?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matty replied, "This isn't Erebus, you don't have to call me Boss."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carson immediately changed his tone, "Okay, Mr. Lawrence."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In fact, whether in Erebus or privately, Matty was quite oppressive. Talking to him face to face, Carson couldn't help but feel a sense of respect and awe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matty never beat around the bush and said directly, "The other day, I saw Amelia in the surveillance video. She looks a lot like my first love."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carson had just taken a sip of coffee and almost spat it out, "Huh?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matty didn't care about his reaction and continued, "I had Dylan get a strand of her hair for a paternity test. She is my granddaughter."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carson was stunned and it took him a while to react, "She is my sister's child. How did she become your granddaughter?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Johnny had told him before that </span><span>Sumasa</span><span> was not part of The Clark family, but he </span><span>never expected her to be Matty's daughter. Based on his memory of his sister's appearance, he carefully examined Matty and could indeed sense some resemblance between them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ignoring Carson's surprise, Matty continued, "My lover Sophia gave birth to her and, to get back at me, sent her away. Do you know how she came to your house?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carson snapped out of his thoughts and said, "I don't know about this. Even the fact that she is not our family's daughter was told to me by my nephew."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His parents had kept this matter a secret. If it weren't for Johnny telling him the truth when Ashley died, he would still be in the dark.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matty stared into Carson's eyes and, seeing that he didn't seem to be lying, furrowed his brow, "Does anyone else in your family know about this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carson shook his head, "My grandfather has passed away, and my parents are also gone. There should be no one in the family who knows how </span><span>Sumasa</span><span> came to The Clark family."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matty immediately ordered, "Call the old butler who followed my grandfather."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carson said, "He's very old now and has dementia..."</span></p></div>
