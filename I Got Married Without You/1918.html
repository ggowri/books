        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matty raised his hand and the black-clad men behind him immediately lifted their cutting tools, taking turns to cut through the door of the operating room.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In just a moment, the entire door was removed!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"All doctors, save my granddaughter!" Matty commanded.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Matty's order, all the doctors rushed into the operating room.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dr. Tenny, exhausted, breathed a sigh of relief when he saw other doctors coming to help.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He willingly stepped down from the lead surgeon position and handed the scalpel to someone else.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hugh, who was still trying to save the baby, also let go of his guilty conscience and focused on saving the child.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only Dominic couldn't believe it. He looked past the doctors and stared at Matty, who stood outside leaning on a cane.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What did he just say?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said Amelia is his granddaughter?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia is actually Matty's granddaughter?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Lawrence family is a North American giant, and Amelia, behind her, has such a prestigious background?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matty outside the door also saw Dominic and his bloodthirsty eyes locked onto him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dominic, dare you give up on my granddaughter? It seems like you're tired of living!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A cold and murderous voice echoed in the operating room, and everyone could feel the killing intent.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instinctively, everyone lowered their heads.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They all knew that Matty, the North American giant, had paved his way with blood-soaked hands.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dominic was well aware of this too.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When his gaze met Matty's eyes, which seemed to want to strangle him, his heart trembled for a moment. However, he fearlessly raised his chin and retorted.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Lawrence, our positions are both for the sake of protecting the people we want to protect."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's not up to you to decide, but the gun in my hand decides!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dominic didn't respond to Matty's words anymore, and Matty didn't disturb the surgery any further.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both sides focused on Amelia and the baby, waiting for the doctors to snatch life back from the hands of death.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Johnny saw Amelia's condition, his heart suddenly tightened, and his body couldn't help but tremble.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not to mention James, even he felt scared seeing so much blood.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fortunately, he knew that Carson had a very capable doctor by his side. When Carson's wife gave birth to Herb, they also experienced a difficult delivery, which was saved by that doctor.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He originally wanted to make a call and ask if this doctor could save both the pregnant woman and the baby, but he didn't expect Carson to say that the doctor was Matty's personal doctor and wouldn't treat anyone else.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After thinking about it, Johnny still asked for Matty's phone number and borrowed the doctor from him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It just so happened that Matty in Arcadia heard that Amelia was in critical condition and urgently brought the old doctor over.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The old doctor was quite impressive. He brought all his most talented students with him, most of whom held high positions in obstetrics.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking that there is strength in numbers, but they were still one step too late.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If they had come earlier, Amelia wouldn't have experienced cardiac arrest.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the old doctor was still impressive.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He took over Dr. Tenny's hemostatic forceps and stopped the bleeding on Amelia's abdomen.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, without even blinking, he pushed away the defibrillator operator and injected a liquid near Amelia's heart.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The nearby students immediately opened the silver needle bag, and the old doctor's fingers brushed over the silver needles, pulling out a few and quickly inserting them into Amelia's head.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Continue defibrillation!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The doctors quickly approached and placed the defibrillator on her heart, while the old doctor grabbed Amelia's hand and continued to insert needles into her arm.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he rapidly inserted the needles into acupuncture points, he kept an eye on the cardiac monitor until the faint waves returned.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only then did the old doctor give a solemn order.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The patient's heartbeat has recovered. Quickly start the blood transfusion!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The doctor in charge of the blood transfusion quickly approached and hung up the blood bag.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fortunately, Dr. Gilbert and Dr. Tenny had anticipated that the mother would experience heavy bleeding and had prepared enough blood in advance.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Otherwise, the blood supply would have been critical, making the situation even more dangerous.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After the blood was transfused, the faint waves gradually returned to normal. The old doctor remained focused and continued to insert needles.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James, standing nearby, heard the sound of the heartbeat coming from the cardiac monitor.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The tension in his body suddenly relaxed, and it felt as if all his strength had been suddenly drained away.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't support himself any longer and knelt down on one knee.</span></p></div>
