        <h1>Chapter 1678 Two good news</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as Paul finished speaking, he heard a series of sirens outside. He quickly looked out the window and saw the security guard opening the gate to let the police into the mansion...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul quickly signaled to the bodyguard, who immediately released Elsie. Elsie, still caught up in Paul's manipulation, didn't react until several police officers approached her and arrested her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elsie couldn't believe the outcome and suddenly erupted in anger, shouting, "I just lied once, why are you arresting me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The police coldly replied, "Paul accused you of molesting him. Come with us to the police station for investigation."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought she would be accused of slander, but she never expected that Paul would accuse her of molestation. Elsie was in disbelief, saying, "I never touched you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul sneered, "You touched me all over when I was drunk. What else do you call it if not molestation?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ignoring Elsie, Paul handed the recording pen to the police, saying, "I will charge her with molestation, defamation, and false accusation."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The police took the recording pen and said, "We'll take her back for further verification. If you want to sue, get yourself a good lawyer."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After thanking the police, Paul looked at Elsie and said, "You know, my lawyer is Anthony."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elsie's face turned dark, but she couldn't accept it. She cursed at Paul in unbearable words as the police car drove away and disappeared into the estate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After dealing with Elsie, Paul didn't wait for Eva to apologize and immediately took out his phone to call Camilla, asking her to explain what happened at the airport.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luckily, Camilla wasn't like Elsie. After hearing Paul's explanation, she couldn't help but laugh and then openly resolved the conflict caused by "that kiss."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sorry, I kissed little Mr. Evans as a way of saying goodbye. It didn't mean anything more. Don't misunderstand."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva blushed upon hearing this and saw her embarrassment. Paul quickly took the phone and said to Camilla, "Miss Hill, to put my wife's mind at ease, after this call, I will delete your contact information. In the future, if there are any work-related matters, please contact my assistant directly."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In consideration of how much you love your wife, do as you please."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the other party's consent, Paul quickly hung up the phone. But when he tried to delete Camilla's contact information, Eva held down the screen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't delete your business partner's contact."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's okay, let her contact my assistant directly for work matters."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva lowered her lashes and spoke apologetically, "You make me seem petty."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was tactfully pointing out her own flaw, but Paul simply nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Although you can be petty, I don't mind."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Paul's smiling face, Eva released her grip on the phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, James suddenly called Paul.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Paul get up to answer the call, Eva could sense that he had relieved himself of a burden, which made him appear relaxed even from behind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And she, isn't she the same?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva raised her hand and gently touched her small belly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it wasn't for this child, they might have already gone their separate ways.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After finishing the call, Paul put on his jacket and said to Eva, "James has something urgent to discuss with me. I'll go to the company first. You stay home and rest."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, Eva didn't resist. She obediently nodded and said, "Remember to come back early."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Paul reached the doorway, he suddenly turned back, bent down, and embraced Eva, passionately kissing her red lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva patted his chest, and only then did he release her. With the joy of a child who got candy, he turned and smiled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His Rolls-Royce had just arrived at the entrance of the Evans' company when he saw James, tall and slender, open the car door and step out of the extended Lincoln.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feeling extremely pleased, Paul quickly walked toward James. "James, I have two pieces of good news to tell you. Which one do you want to hear first?"</span></p></div>
