        <h1>Chapter 1949 A little bit scary</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She couldn't help but press her body against James, her hot skin clinging tightly to his firm chest, creating an intimate connection.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James was thorough in his foreplay, waiting until Amelia moaned and actively sought more before grabbing her hand and picking up a condom from the nearby table. "It's your turn," he said.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia, with her hazy eyes, followed his bloodshot gaze to the thin film in his hand, feeling a sense of shame.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She unfolded it and placed it where it needed to go...</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But as soon as she had put it on, James couldn't wait any longer and took her forcefully.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia trembled all over, but desired to be closer to him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James felt her tightness and couldn't control himself, going deeper and deeper until he couldn't hold back any longer and let out a groan.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He bit her lip, savoring the taste. "Babe, one more time," he said.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia was getting tired and tried to resist, but James held her down and with a few more moves, brought her to the point of no return.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had no choice but to grab onto the soaked sheets and let him have his way...</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as James was about to reach the peak of pleasure, a knocking sound came from outside the door. "Auntie, Uncle, Alexander is missing! Please come and find him!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia, upon hearing that their child was missing, lost all interest in reaching the peak of pleasure.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She pushed James away in a hurry, grabbed her discarded robe from the floor, and rushed out of the room.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What happened? How could the baby suddenly disappear?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't know. I finished practicing calligraphy and went back to sleep, but he wasn't in the crib. Frank searched the castle, but couldn't find him..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia's heart raced with fear. Her face, once flushed with passion, turned pale in an instant.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was in a panic, but managed to steady herself and hurried downstairs.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James, who was so close to experiencing ultimate pleasure, had no time for desire now.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He also wrapped himself in a robe and quickly walked out of the bedroom.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Frank, check the surveillance."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm on it."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James descended the stairs, heading straight for Grace's room.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia searched the room but couldn't find Alexander. When she saw James arrive, she instantly broke down.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If only I hadn't let him sleep alone. Now our child is missing, and if something else happens, I'll hate myself..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James furrowed his brow and reached out to embrace the frantic Amelia.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't be afraid. No one dares to touch my son."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Besides, there were bodyguards stationed outside the castle. Who would dare to sneak in and take away a little baby in the middle of the night?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While James was pondering this, Frank, who had finished checking the surveillance, came running over with a bewildered expression, holding his phone.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You put the little master on the crib, but he crawled out from inside and made his way under the bed..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Frank handed the phone to James and then rushed to the bed, trying to reach Alexander hiding in the corner.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Frank's large frame couldn't reach the little master who had crawled into the corner. He anxiously called out to Grace, "Grace, quickly get your brother out..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Grace could go over, James had already reached the bed and lifted it up. There, lying on the warm carpet, was their little master, with a round belly, sleeping soundly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Amelia breathed a sigh of relief and quickly ran over to pick up their child from under the bed, holding him tightly. "My precious baby, I won't let you sleep alone anymore."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James, who had finally relaxed his tense nerves, heard Amelia's words and immediately tensed up again.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But compared to this problem, he was more curious as to why their child crawled out of the crib and hid under the bed.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he pondered this, Alexander, who was nestled on Amelia's shoulder, opened his round, bright eyes and smiled at James.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing the adorable smile on the little one's face, James raised an eyebrow.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Next to him, Grace clearly sensed something and quickly walked up to James. "Uncle, do you also find Alexander a little bit scary?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James smirked. "An infant who hasn't even been weaned yet, trying to compete with me for my wife? He's overestimating himself."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing the self-assured man, Grace sighed. "Uncle, you don't understand the power a child has over their mother..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And indeed, James didn't understand. For the next five years, he would be dominated by Alexander.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't until five years later, on a certain day, that he finally turned the tables...</span></p></div>
