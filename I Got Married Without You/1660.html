        <h1>Chapter 1660 Make Elsie tell the truth</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul's hand holding the phone trembled slightly, but he couldn't believe he had done such a thing. After a moment of contemplation, he reopened the surveillance footage and found that his level of unconsciousness when he was drunk was different from Eva's. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Judging by how he collapsed at the hotel entrance, his lack of consciousness was purely a loss of voluntary behavior. In this state, could he still have the ability to do what was accused of? </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elsie and Eva entered almost at the same time, and it seemed too coincidental for a person without voluntary behavior to respond in such a short time. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When a man was drunk and may or may not have done something, it's hard to tell. Paul could only rely on these two points to make a judgment. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Eva, who had witnessed it firsthand, would not believe it. He had to find Elsie and </span><span>make her tell the truth</span><span>. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul's mind became clearer, and he called Kate to prepare a private jet for her return home. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kate thought he had made a mistake that Eva wouldn't forgive and chose to give up, but little did she know that he would tie Elsie up after returning home. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kate, who understood the reason, looked at Paul and suddenly saw a glimpse of James in him, feeling somewhat relieved that Paul finally had a bit of James' dominance. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But no matter how Paul pressured her, Elsie refused to admit it. "Paul, that night, you were drunk, but not completely unconscious. Otherwise, how could you have thrown me to the ground as soon as you entered the house?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul instantly became angry but couldn't find any evidence or words to defend himself. "There is no surveillance in my apartment. You naturally want to frame me however you want." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elsie, unafraid, provocatively said, "Paul, if you insist on accusing me, then go to the police and let them investigate to see if you forced me or if I framed you." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul, who felt he hadn't done anything, didn't bother arguing with her anymore. He immediately took out his phone to call the police but was stopped by Kate, who was sitting next to him. "Paul, if you call the police, she will tell them that she kindly helped her ex-boyfriend who was passed out on the ground and brought him home. Who would have known that after returning home, you would force her?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kate, who knew what kind of person Elsie was, looked at Paul with shrewdness in her eyes. "You'll be stuck with the label of 'rape' if you do that." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If I was in that state, how could I have the ability to commit 'rape'?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who knows if you were pretending to be without the ability to act?" Kate meant that only Paul himself knew if he had the ability to act. But under Elsie's counter-accusation, would others believe what he said? Would it serve as evidence? </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even if I had the ability to act, I would never touch her!" Paul, losing control, looked at Elsie with disgust. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Paul, that's not what you said when you wanted me." Elsie, held down by two bodyguards, raised her eyes that seemed full of tenderness and threw a seductive look at Paul. "You said I was beautiful and satisfied with my body." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul was almost driven to madness. He clenched his fists tightly, suppressing the urge to hit someone. "Even if I had ten mouths, none of them would say something like that to you!" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elsie was about to respond but was interrupted by Kate's cold voice. "You just said Paul forced you. So why didn't you call the police that night? Why did you wait so long to accuse him?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elsie, who had once been defeated by Kate, showed some restraint when facing her. "Because I love Paul, so even if I was forced, I didn't mind." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>So</span><span> you were willing?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I was willing at the time, but now that you've brought me back and forced me to say that nothing happened with Paul, I can only tell the truth to the police." Elsie, relying on the lack of evidence, was just making baseless accusations. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To get the truth out of her, it seemed that some old skills needed to be used. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kate thought about this and turned her head, looking at Paul, who was filled with anger. "Paul, your father wants to see you. Go to the study and meet him first. Come find me in half an hour." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul was too well protected to make decisive moves. Unlike her, who was used to using methods, dealing with a petty person like Elsie was an easy task. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul, who was pushed away, wanted to stay and resolve it himself, but when he touched Kate's cold gaze, he hesitated. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, Paul knew that his mother wasn't an ordinary person. Perhaps she could get results quickly, and he didn't want to see Elsie's face anymore, so he got up and left.</span></p></div>
