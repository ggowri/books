        <h1>Chapter 1740 Send him a gold leaf</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you the one who will drug us?" The little girl, who couldn't understand anything, was scared and started crying when Johnny yelled at her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Waaah... Grandpa, there's a weirdo here, come save me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the dock, just finished unloading cargo, an old man sitting on the ground smoking with his companions, heard his granddaughter crying and quickly turned around to see her being held in the air by someone. He immediately got up and rushed over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let go of my granddaughter, or I'll beat you to death!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing the other person holding tools for unloading cargo and accompanied by several </span><span>old men running over, Amelia quickly reached out, took the child from Johnny's hands, and placed her safely on the ground, then took out a stack of cash to give to the old men.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After comforting the ordinary people who had been used, Amelia glared at Johnny in anger. "Instead of asking the little girl who gave her the note, you suspect her of drugging Erebus. Do you have a problem?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Realizing his mistake in judgment, Johnny felt a little guilty. He took out his phone and called the person he had arranged to be in the dark, asking if they had seen anyone giving the little girl a note. The person said no, so he hung up the phone in frustration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia glanced at the furious Johnny, picked up a box, and walked towards the number 1 ship. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because she was handcuffed, Johnny had to follow her. The two of them boarded the number 1 ship, which had very few passengers and was quite spacious. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They suspected that Erebus would make a move here. Just when they thought so, the number 1 ship suddenly started moving. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Johnny frowned slightly when he saw the ship move, but he should have arranged for someone to catch up quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, when the ship arrived at its destination and docked, they were both awake. Amelia and Johnny didn't know what Erebus was up to, so they got up to find the captain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both Johnny and Amelia suspected that the captain was arranged by Erebus, but the captain said he had been operating the ship for many years and had to make regular trips every day, regardless of how many passengers were on board. He even showed them his certificate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia thought that Erebus would only give notes to naive little girls, so how could such a cautious person take the risk of arranging a captain who had been operating the ship for years, unless the captain was Erebus's person.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But if the captain was Erebus's person, James and the others would definitely find out. They had to personally go to Erebus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After thinking it through, Amelia pulled Johnny out of the cabin. Just as they reached the deck, many passengers boarded the ship. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When a young fisherman girl walked up to them, she handed Amelia another note, which read: [Ship number 2].</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They thought they just had to change ships once, but ended up changing several times in a row. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia guessed that Johnny's people had been noticed by Erebus, so Erebus was deliberately messing with them. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Otherwise, they would have been drugged at the designated location on the dock, instead of boarding ships number 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. This was a warning to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After realizing this, Amelia told Johnny's people to stay away. Just as Johnny finished giving orders, he immediately received new instructions to land on the island within two minutes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They thought that after landing on the island, someone would come to drug them, but </span><span>they ended up waiting on the deserted island until late at night, without seeing a single soul.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Johnny was so angry that he almost kicked all the wild grass on the island, while Amelia looked him up and down. "They probably saw that there was an extra person with me, so they didn't come..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her implication was that she wanted Johnny to go back, but because of Erebus's actions, Johnny's fighting spirit was even more aroused.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They dare not let me go, which means Erebus is nothing. If he has the guts, he should let me go. I will definitely destroy that organization!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as he said this, he felt a sudden pain in his arm. He thought Amelia was twisting it, so he subconsciously looked down at her, only to see her clean and beautiful face multiplying into two, then three, four, until it became blurry...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He shook his increasingly heavy head in an attempt to stay awake, but in an instant, he lost consciousness. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, Amelia also felt dizzy and then blacked out, falling to the ground...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After they both fell to the ground, black-clad men wearing masks emerged from the bushes. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They looked down at the two of them and then lifted their military boots to kick the handcuffs on their wrists.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The guy is determined to go, give him a gold leaf."</span></p></div>
