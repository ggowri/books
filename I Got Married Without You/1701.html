        <h1>Chapter 1701 A precious photo</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A few days later, the wedding at sea ended successfully. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva displayed utmost politeness and respect at the wedding, and the Evans Family couldn't stop praising her. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing everyone's compliments about Eva, Kate couldn't help but stop and turn back to look at Eva standing under the ship. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing her offering a gift to every member of the Evans Family as they disembarked, Kate's lips slightly curled. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't know how it happened, but in just a few days of being together, she found herself liking Eva more and more...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After seeing off everyone, Eva turned to face Amelia, who had been with her all along. "In addition to the gift I gave you, I have another present for you," Eva said. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia didn't hesitate and reached out her hand, asking, "What is it?" Eva handed her the gift and also took out a photo, placing it in Amelia's palm. "Take a look, do you like it?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia took the photo and looked at it. It showed the Evans Family and the Clark Family gathered together on the open-air deck of the ship.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The photo was cleverly taken. James sat in the center, with the Clark Family on his left and the Evans Family on his right. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both sides looked at each other. James, however, had his eyes fixed on her, and she happened to be looking back at him. The surroundings featured a clean and tidy sofa and the vast ocean...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Apart from that, Ryan sat in a corner, and Anthony held a glass of red wine, gazing at Edith. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The image froze that evening. Amelia, filled with joy, caressed the photo and asked, "Eva, who took this?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva looked at Neil, who was walking ahead with Grace, and replied, "He took it." On the night they played cards, Grace clung to Neil, asking for food and drink. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, after he put the child to sleep and the gambling was over, Neil, in order to show his resentment, picked up a camera and captured this scene. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He then found Eva and blackmailed her for a gold bar, which Eva finally obtained along with the photo.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After hearing the twisted and intriguing story behind the photo, Amelia suddenly felt less joyful. "It's definitely Neil's style," she said. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva smiled gently and said, "Although I lost a gold bar, it's still a good memento." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia smiled too and agreed, "Yes, it has great sentimental value." The image of James and both families gathered together was unique and meaningful. It was a once-in-a-lifetime moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Eva's wedding, there was more good news from Henry's side. He was officially awarded the Nobel Prize in Medicine upon returning from abroad. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He invited a few friends who were close to Stella to have a meal together. During the dinner, Henry, who had been drinking several glasses of wine in a row, announced with a smile, "I've decided to settle in Panama from now on." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although James had intended for Henry to take over the hospital, upon hearing his decision, he furrowed his brows slightly but didn't try to stop him. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone had their own choices, and it's difficult for Henry to move on after losing </span><span>his love. Going to the graveyard to accompany Stella wasn't a wrong decision.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it were James, he might not just stay at the grave but rather sacrifice himself for love. This was how he understands love. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So he wouldn't try to hold Henry back, but kindly reminded him, "Stella probably wouldn't want you to do this." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Henry naturally knew that Stella wouldn't want it either, but he said, "Being by her side and occasionally visiting their graves is also good."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Henry knew very well that two people without even ashes to their names might now be wandering as lost souls in the human world, he didn't think it mattered. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He felt that as long as Stella lay in the graveyard, silently accompanying her for a lifetime was enough. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Henry's unwavering determination, Amelia lowered her gaze and asked, "What about your parents?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Henry, who had already made arrangements, smiled and replied, "They're willing to go to Panama with me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing this, Amelia's eyes welled up with tears. This family was truly wonderful, but Stella... She chose to be with the person she loved, sacrificing her life to search for Erin's lost soul. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia didn't know if Stella had found her or not. Thinking of this, Amelia's tears flowed uncontrollably, and she quickly grabbed a tissue to wipe them away. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing her cry, Henry's eyes also turned red. "Amelia, don't be sad. Stella will always live in our hearts," he said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia nodded but couldn't find the words to respond. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva, who was beside her, held her hand and gently patted it. The people at the table fell silent, thinking of Stella. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eventually, Henry composed himself, raised his glass again, and toasted with everyone, and the atmosphere gradually eased.</span></p></div>
