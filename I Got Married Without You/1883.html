        <h1>Chapter 1883 Be gentle</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Five more minutes of kissing, okay?&rdquo; </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia gasped for breath. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're injured, don't move around anymore." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She pushed him to lie down, but James grabbed her wrist and pulled her into his embrace, holding her waist tightly. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't ask for Amelia's consent anymore. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He raised his hand, pressed it against the back of her head, and kissed her lips again with precision. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they rolled and turned, Amelia's face turned even redder. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Babe." </span><span>James</span><span> bit her earlobe. "What should I do? I want to make love to you." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, you don't." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James restrained his desire and held Amelia's hand. "I'm going crazy." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia knew that it was safe to have sex after six months of pregnancy, but James was injured, so she had to refuse: "Wait until you're fully recovered." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although he appeared flushed, James had lost a lot of blood, and he couldn't engage in such activities at this time. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James didn't care about his injury at all. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He restrained his desires and let go of Amelia's hand, creating some distance between them. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then he looked at Amelia, whose face was turning red. "My injury should be healed </span><span>in about twenty days. During this time, I'll arrange for a nutritionist to take care of your body." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After explaining, James added, "Not for the purpose of making love, but because you need to take care of your body." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia smiled and reached out to hold his arm, resting her head gently on his shoulder. "Okay, I'll listen to you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James quickly arranged for a nutritionist to come and make a plan based on Amelia's physical condition. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Within just twenty days, Amelia's complexion improved. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although she didn't gain much weight, she looked better than before. James' shoulder wound also healed well. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Originally, he was supposed to stay in the hospital for another week to observe the follow-up situation. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But James didn't want to stay any longer, so he had Andrew handle the discharge procedures. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their private jet back to their home country was scheduled for the next afternoon, and they checked into a hotel overnight. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia's belly had grown significantly, and James insisted on helping her take a bath because he was </span><span>worried</span><span> she might have difficulty doing it herself. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After cleaning the bathtub, he filled it with warm water. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once the water was ready, he lifted Amelia and gently placed her in the bathtub, then sat beside her, helping her cleanse her skin. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they washed, James' fingers became restless, gradually moving from her lower back to the front of her chest. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His lower abdomen tightened instantly, and his throat became dry and itchy. "Babe, my injury is healed. Can we?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing his hoarse voice, Amelia knew what he was asking and couldn't help but lower her head and smile. "Be gentle..." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James, like a wild horse, couldn't resist and within seconds, he was already inside the bathtub. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the tall and strong man pressed down on her, Amelia reached out and pressed against his firm abdomen. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Not here, it's too hard." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I know." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James lifted Amelia out of the water. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't care if they were wet. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He held her and carried her to the bed while kissing her. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tonight, he was </span><span>more gentle</span><span> than ever before. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In fact, he was so gentle that Amelia thoroughly enjoyed it. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even after it was over, Amelia couldn't bear to let go and held onto his waist. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't want to separate, and James felt the same. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"One more time?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wanted to refuse, but after such a long time without being intimate, both of them found it difficult to restrain themselves. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She hesitated for a second, and in that second, James had already taken action. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With his gentle kisses on her lips and ears, he reached out to touch her sensitive areas. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Honey..." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James was always very sensitive in these matters and instinctively increased his intensity. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia suddenly couldn't bear it and arched her body backward. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Afraid that she might strain herself, he quickly lifted her waist with his hands. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But even so, James still couldn't be satisfied., it should be said that it wasn't enough.</span></p></div>
