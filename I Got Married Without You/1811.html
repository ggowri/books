        <h1>Chapter 1811 A church in Barcelona</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gigi eventually passed out, and Amelia immediately called the doctor for emergency assistance. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a round of emergency treatment, Samuel concluded that Gigi was beyond help and decided to send her to a mental hospital. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This led to a heated argument between Johnny and Samuel, and it was only when Gigi, feeling hopeless, shouted, "Dad, you've already killed my child, do you want to force me to death too?" that Samuel relented. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He explained that he was afraid that if she continued to act this way, he would be driven insane. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gigi agreed to stop causing trouble so that he wouldn't be ridiculed. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Samuel, feeling touched, left after saying, "Do as you wish."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Samuel left, Gigi, with her eyes red and swollen, looked at Johnny, who was exhausted both physically and mentally. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Brother, there's </span><span>a church in Barcelona</span><span> that Zack and I wanted to visit but never did. Can you let me go there?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Johnny, after staring into Gigi's eyes filled with despair for five minutes, made up his mind. "I'll go with you." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gigi wanted to refuse, but Johnny said, "Gigi, no one is more important than you." Unable to control her tears, Gigi said, "Brother, you don't blame me, do you?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Johnny shook his head and wiped away her tears. "You've lost the two people you loved the most. I can't let you lose me too." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Losing doesn't mean death, but indifference and abandonment are also forms of loss. Samuel, her biological father, was the first to abandon her. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gigi got up from the hospital bed and threw herself into Johnny's arms, crying as if she were a helpless child seeking her brother's protection. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Johnny comforted her, patting her back until she fell asleep, and then left the ward with Amelia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia asked him, "Can you take care of Gigi by yourself?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Johnny looked at her and said, "Then come with us." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia instinctively touched her stomach, her actions revealed everything, &ldquo;When will you set off?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Johnny withdrew his probing. "When she's more stable, and when my injuries are better." Amelia nodded, feeling guilty and a little embarrassed. "When you leave, I'll see you off..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Johnny shook his head. "There's no need. I'll be back, so there's nothing to see off." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He added, "When your child is born, I'll come back to give you a gift." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia said, "You don't know my due date." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Johnny replied, "I have your obstetrician's phone number." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This statement left Amelia puzzled. Johnny noticed his slip of the tongue and quickly added, "The doctor left me the number when he was taking care of you." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia was surprised. "Why do you care about when I give birth?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Johnny, feeling annoyed, said, "I've noticed that you've become more talkative since you got pregnant, and it's driving me crazy." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he left and went back into the ward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>During Gigi's stay in the hospital, her emotions stabilized, and she no longer cried day and night. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Amelia by her side, she found the strength and comfort she needed. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thanks to Amelia's care, Gigi pulled through and was soon discharged. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Johnny took Gigi directly to Barcelona after her release. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the day of their departure, Eva and Amelia both went to the airport to see them off. Before leaving, Gigi turned and hugged Amelia. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She whispered in her ear, "Amelia, thank you for your kindness and understanding. Otherwise, I wouldn't have made it until the day Zack messaged me." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia patted her back gently. "Gigi, you have to stay strong. Only by living can you live up to Zack's expectations and never forget him." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gigi said she would remember Zack for the rest of her life, just as Amelia would remember James, but their life paths were different. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gigi let go of Amelia and, with the help of a servant, walked into the airport. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Johnny was about to leave, he picked up his phone and waved it in front of Amelia. "I'll continue to investigate Erebus. If there's any news, I'll call you. Remember to answer." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Watching Amelia's obedient appearance, Johnny felt a pang of regret and hugged her. "Amelia, take care of yourself while I'm away." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nearby, Paul, leaning against the car, frowned when he saw this scene. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fortunately, Johnny's embrace before parting was just that, and he didn't overstep his bounds. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Otherwise, Paul would have rushed over and pulled them apart. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Johnny let go of Amelia and walked into the airport.</span></p></div>
