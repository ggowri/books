        <h1>Chapter 1988 Approaching Death</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander turned off the lights and lay on his side in bed, curled up in a ball. No matter what he thought, James had been enduring pain since he was born, calmly accompanying him as he grew up...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As a child, Alexander was still so immature, ignoring James. Thinking of the damn things he did in his childhood, Alexander raised his hand and slapped himself hard...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After the fight, Alexander, who had never shed tears, uncontrollably covered his face and buried himself in bed, crying like a child about to be abandoned, trembling all over...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Previously, he didn't know the meaning of death, but now that death was so close in front of him. Alexander deeply felt how much he loved his parents. He spent the whole night flipping through medical books, searching for a way to remove the chip...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Overnight, Alexander searched through all the medical books related to craniotomy and even called Henry, George, and all the famous doctors he knew, but the results were all powerless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every doctor could not guarantee the removal of the chip while preventing the outbreak of the virus inside. Alexander sat helplessly in the room for a whole night.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the room, not a single ray of moonlight could penetrate. He was very desperate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander stayed up all night, and the next day, as he saw his loving parents, he couldn't help but want to cry again. "So you've never had a fight before, it's because there's not much time left, and that's why you cherish each other."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia was as uncomfortable as Alexander, but due to the sedimentation of time, she appeared more stable than before. "Whether it's because time is running out or not, couples should cherish each other."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander sat down at the dining table, forced a smile, and didn't say anything. He stared straight at James, who had no trace of death from his appearance. "Father, I plan to study medicine."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wanted to study medicine. With his intelligence and computational ability, he could definitely measure the force and distance required to remove the chip. But James vetoed it. "It's too late. Don't waste your time."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, the medication could no longer suppress his headache. James hurt so much that he fell to the ground every night, knowing that his life was running out, so he did not want Alexander to waste his time on useless things at all. "Follow me to learn management."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander looked at James' resolute and uncompromising expression and silently smiled, "When I was five years old, you taught me theoretical knowledge. When I was ten years old, you taught me self-defense skills. Now I'm fifteen years old, you teach me management skills. You arranged it carefully just to prepare for leaving. But... Have you ever thought that I wouldn't want to be separated from you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia was eating silently, heard Alexander's words, and tears streamed down her plate. James had already taken life and death lightly, saying, "People will die eventually. I'm just taking a step early, and it doesn't matter much. As a man, you should not hesitate on such matters."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Compared to James' indifference, Alexander endured immense sadness. "Father, let me go study medicine. I can definitely think of a way to remove the chip from your brain."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James fell silent and looked at Amelia, who had been crying non-stop. Those scorching tears drop by dropped on many nights and smashed into his heart, making him indifferent to life and death, yet also so reluctant. James was not afraid of death but worried about the woman he had loved for a lifetime.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He extended his strong fingers and grabbed Amelia's trembling finger on her leg as she cried, gently pressing the back of her hand with his fingertips. "Don't cry. I will always be with you..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James did not agree. But Alexander followed Amelia to church to pray and said to her, "Mom, I study management with my father during the day and medicine at night. I hope you can help me..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once upon a time, James prayed that she could recover her health. Now, it was Amelia praying that James lived longer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She sincerely prayed and then looked at Alexander. "Okay, I'll help you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She pinned all her hopes on Alexander. "If possible... please, my son, be sure to save my husband."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was much taller than Amelia. He reached out his arm, grabbed Amelia's shoulder, and held her tightly. "Mom, don't worry. I will definitely do it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James didn't know their plan, so he propped himself up and had Alexander follow him, learning how to manage the Evans Group and telling him how to know people and make good use of them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander seemed to grow up overnight, humbly studying while also desperately researching medical skills. He spent countless nights in the laboratory performing surgeries.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James was completely unaware, struggled with a headache after a coma, and wobbled into his coat. With Andrew's help, he arrived at the artificial intelligence center of the Evans Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He personally developed and produced the robot, but the final step was not perfected by James. He had to make the robot thoroughly before he died.</span></p></div>
