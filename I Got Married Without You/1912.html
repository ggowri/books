        <h1>Chapter 1912 I can't take that risk of losing you</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James stood silently at the door, watching Amelia cry uncontrollably.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His heart ached, torn between his wife and his child.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Making this decision was agonizing. But as a man, he had to bear this burden.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He just hoped that after making the choice, his wife would be safe.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If not, his own existence would lose its meaning.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia held onto the baby's clothe</span><span>s and lay in the baby's room, tears streaming down her face as she fell into a restless sleep.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James sat beside her, staring at her back. He didn't sleep all night.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>During the preparation for the cesarean section, Amelia didn't say a word.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She leaned against the hospital bed, one hand caressing her belly and the other clutching the baby's clothes.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She looked calm and soulless, like a porcelain doll.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Amelia like this, James couldn't bear it.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hugged her, kissed her, and touched her, hoping to revive her spirit. But she didn't respond at all.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't until the day of the surgery that she grabbed James' hand and pleaded, "Honey, I'm willing to take a 10% chance. Please let me give birth to our child. I beg you, please..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James looked at her hand holding his own, his heart softening.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he had to hold her wrist and, with tired, bloodshot eyes, told her, "Amelia, I can't take that risk</span><span> of losing you</span><span>."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With those words, Amelia's hope shattered.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She deflated like a deflated balloon, losing the ability to rise.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She slowly let go of James' hand, put on the surgical gown, and lay on the operating table, allowing the doctors to push her into the operating room.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as the door was about to close, James grabbed Amelia's hand, holding it tightly in his palm.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With his other hand, he gently caressed her face and said, "Amelia, don't worry. I won't let anything happen to you."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The love and reluctance in James' eyes warmed Amelia's heart.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She looked at him and nodded gently, saying, "I know. With you by my side, I'll be fine."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James forced a pale smile, bent down, and kissed her forehead tenderly. "I'll be waiting for you."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia nodded, opened her mouth as if to say something, but didn't know what to say.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She could only smile, push away James' hand, and as their fingers separated, the doctors pushed the operating table into the operating room.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia saw James standing outside the door, tall and straight under the white light. Wrapped in a black coat, he looked even more handsome, his face flawless. But he gradually disappeared from her sight.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the door closed, Amelia's James, who couldn't be seen anymore, stood still for two seconds before quickly turning around and heading towards the dressing room next to the operating room.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dr. Gilbert, who had just put on a sterile surgical gown, was about to enter the operating room when she bumped into James at the door.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James didn't wait for Dr. Gilbert to speak and coldly said, "I've hired the top experts to assist you. If anything happens to her, I will hold you responsible."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing Mr. Evans' words, Dr. Gilbert felt even more pressure. "Mr. Evans, the risks during the surgery are unpredictable. All I can say is that we will do our best, but..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man towering above her interrupted her, "All I want is for her to survive. If you can't do that, what's the point of your presence here?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dr. Gilbert, frightened by James' words, turned pale. But he didn't care about her feelings. He raised his chin and said coldly, "Can you do it?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dr. Gilbert had no choice but to promise, gritting her teeth, "Yes!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only then did James soften his gaze and continued coldly, "Give me a sterile gown. I want to be in the operating room with her."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't let Amelia face the surgery alone. He would be by her side, holding her hand, giving her strength until she was safe.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dr. Gilbert didn't expect Mr. Evans to enter the operating room.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feeling even more pressured, she said, "Mr. Evans, the surgery is very dangerous. The presence of family members can affect the doctors..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dr. Gilbert didn't finish her sentence as she felt a pair of intense eyes staring at her. She didn't say anything more and immediately sent someone to get a sterile gown.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While James was changing clothes, Amelia, inside the operating room, was being assisted by nurses as she lay on the operating table, looking at the cold light above her head.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was scared and grabbed the edge of the table with one hand while touching her belly with the other.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When her heart was filled with reluctance, the baby in her belly suddenly moved. It kicked her belly with its tiny feet, and then its hands started moving vigorously, as if saying to Amelia, "Mommy, don't get rid of me..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia's heart tilted towards the baby. She couldn't control herself and sat up from the operating table, barefoot, and ran out of the operating room.</span></p></div>
