        <h1>Chapter 1636 Tearing this family apart</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul frowned and turned around. "If you didn't treat Edith like that, maybe I could sit down calmly and have a good meal with you. But think about what you did to your own daughter back then?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He still felt unjust for Edith. Anthony loved Edith so much, but because of his parents, they were separated. If it weren't for wanting to give Eva a decent wedding, he would never want to come back to this family again...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eric slammed the table in anger. "Edith's matter is in the past. Why are you still </span><span>holding onto it and now trying to lecture us? Do you think you've grown up and don't need to respect your parents anymore?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul couldn't be bothered to argue with Eric. "Say whatever you want. I've said what I needed to say. You figure it out yourselves..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If they really disagreed, they could just bypass them and have James be the witness. It wouldn't make much of a difference anyway. After all, the Evans Family wasn't their parents' domain...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And also, don't go looking for Eva privately like before. If I find out you're seeing her, don't blame me for tearing this family apart!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul left these words behind without even looking at the couple, picked up his coat, threw it over his shoulder, and walked away...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing his careless figure, Eric's face turned red with anger. "Look at the fine son you've raised. He doesn't even respect me..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kate was furious and threw down the fork in her hand. "Butler, find Ms. Miller's phone number."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kate wanted to see what Paul would do to break up this family after she secretly met with Ms. Miller!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The butler replied with a "yes" and went off to do his work. He quickly found Eva's phone number and handed the phone to Kate with both hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she took the phone and was about to make the call, Eric stopped her with his hand. "Although that arrogant boy is disrespectful and disregards authority, let's not allow him to become the next Edith."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had already hurt one child's heart, they couldn&rsquo;t hurt the heart of another child. Otherwise, when they grow old, forget having a house full of children and grandchildren, they might not even have a grandchild.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Kate ignored him and pushed Eric's hand away. "This Ms. Miller, she's not even like Anthony. Do you think I would just sit back and watch Paul marry someone like her?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their family had a certain status, not just anyone could marry into it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Of course, James' wife didn't have any background or status either, but at least she had some education and was a top-level architect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Plus, James was the one in control of the family. He could do as he pleases.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Paul was different. His parents were still alive. How could they watch him marry someone randomly?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eric frowned. "Actually, our son isn't that great either. He's been fooling around outside these years, appearing in countless tabloids. Even proper high-class ladies don't want him. If there's someone he wants to marry, let him marry."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kate's face turned black upon hearing this. "My son may not be great, but how can she, a divorced woman, have the audacity to marry into our family?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eric fell silent. This point was indeed hard to argue...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Eric had nothing else to say, Kate disregarded everything and dialed Eva's phone number&mdash;</span></p></div>
