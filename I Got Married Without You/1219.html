        <h1>Chapter 1219 Peter is being stacked in a human pyramid</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jonny vaguely heard Nick's heart-wrenching voice from across the street and was about to go see what was happening when he was blocked by James' tall and sturdy figure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As James sat in the car, he turned his head slightly and revealed a wicked smile. "Before we go to my house, let me take you somewhere first."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jonny, who realized he had been tricked, asked with a frown, "Where are we going?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James nodded at the driver, who immediately locked the doors, and the car shot off like an arrow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nick couldn't catch up and could only take note of the license plate number and contact all of Brook's bodyguards to find Jonny.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He himself disguised as a kidnapper, holding two sacks and leading a group of people </span><span>into the caf&eacute;.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought he could easily kidnap Amelia and Herb and exchange them for Jonny, but...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't expect James to leave someone with immense strength here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Peter was the most skilled member of S, even Zack couldn't beat him. He easily took out half of Nick's bodyguards.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nick clenched his fists and was about to rush forward to fight Peter, but he suddenly became afraid.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, in this situation, they had to act quickly because someone had already called the police. If the police arrived, they might all be arrested.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Knowing that he couldn't win, Nick still gritted his teeth and called on another group of bodyguards to follow him. "Don't fight him head-on, just pin him to the ground so he can't move..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After changing their strategy, the bodyguards rushed forward, taking hits from Peter while getting closer to him. One bodyguard, in particular, was fearless and charged towards Peter. He jumped onto Peter's back like an octopus and held onto his neck tightly. No matter how much Peter tried to shake him off, the bodyguard refused to let go.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After this bodyguard's success, more and more people jumped onto Peter's body. Soon, he was pinned to the ground. Even though he was strong, with over ten people on his back, including those he had knocked down earlier, he couldn't resist. They even started to stack on top of each other like a human pyramid.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia and Herb were both shocked to see this scene, especially Herb, who was completely clueless. He was interested and started recording with his phone, saying, "Look at these kidnappers now. They have no martial arts skills. If they can't win, they just play human pyramid. How disgraceful..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After he finished recording, he planned to send it to his friends. Suddenly, several kidnappers wearing black masks, with only their eyes and mouth exposed, walked towards them. Herb raised his eyebrows at Amelia and said, "I thought they were coming for you, but it looks like they're coming for both of us..."</span></p></div>
