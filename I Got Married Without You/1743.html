        <h1>Chapter 1743 Lion and Dumbass</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The entrance of the operating platform is equipped with gears that match the gears on the edge of the gold leaf in order to be placed inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia and Johnny realized that the gaps along the edges of each golden leaf were different, and it turned out to correspond to the entrance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Johnny touched the console and looked left and right again, finding no problems before nodding to Amelia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia took out the golden leaf and inserted it into the entrance of the operating platform as instructed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the moment of insertion, the gear began to rotate, followed by another electronic sound.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Identity confirmation successful, inviter number - Group 2, Group 7, new player code &ndash; Lion&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The electronic sound fell, and the console vomited out the golden leaf again. Amelia picked it up and glanced at it. The front of the cash leaf was already engraved with the words' lion ', and there was another small numbered number next to it -2-7.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was to say, the person who invited her to Erebus had a code number of 2-7 on Erebus, so they gave the player a new code name based on the other person's code number, representing that she belongs to the player under the name of 2-7.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia didn&rsquo;t quite understand why the people behind the scenes still need to number. Was it true that Erebus's behind the scenes was not just one person, but a group of people, so they needed to divide the numbers and invite the players they want to invite? What was the purpose of doing this?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as she was puzzled, Johnny also put the golden leaf inside, and soon an electronic sound came from the console.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Identity confirmation successful, inviter number - group 1, number 4, player new code &ndash; Dumbass&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Johnny remained silent for a moment, took out the ejected golden leaf, confirmed that it was engraved with 'idiot', and slowly moved her gaze to the golden leaf in Amelia's hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Why is your code name a lion and mine a Dumbass.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;It's probably your inviter who thinks you're a bit... so.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shit!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Johnny was so angry that he threw away the golden leaf and angrily looked up, searching for the camera everywhere.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Inviter of group 4, you shit.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two groups of people in black sitting in front of the big screen looked at each other and then chuckled softly when they saw this scene.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Venom, the person you selected matches the code you distributed very well.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Venom, hidden beneath the mask, was about to speak when he saw two groups of men, number 9, and suddenly got up quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He lightly tapped his finger on his forehead with one hand, looking lazy and casual, but actually feeling thoughtful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Johnny angrily cursed at the inviter of group 1, number 4, another electronic sound came from the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Players, please keep your Golden Leaf safe. Golden Leaf needs to be verified for identity in each round of the game.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After being stunned for a few seconds, Johnny bent down helplessly and picked up the thrown golden leaf again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Now we are releasing the game rules. This time Erebus has changed the rules. Firstly, in the game field, only four spaces will be opened temporarily, with nine rounds of games per space. Each round of the game will gradually increase the difficulty starting from choosing between two Players can only choose a game in one space. Once selected, it cannot be changed or exited, and must continue until the game ends.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;In each round of the game, there are rewards and punishments. There are two options for rewards. The first option accumulates from 5 billion dollars, and the second option is unlimited. The punishment ranges from small to large, from birth to death, and the death method is not limited.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Repeated, players who lose will die.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Once again, the player who loses will die.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Please confirm whether you want to continue. For players who choose to continue, please put the Golden Leaf back on the console, click Continue, and for players who choose to leave, please also put the Golden Leaf back on the console, click Quit.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Players who choose to give up, please sign the confidentiality agreement, and Erebus will send someone to escort you safely away.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After listening, Amelia and Johnny looked at each other.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;They had changed the rules, this gradually increasing difficulty game had a very low chance of winning. Do you still want to continue?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Johnny asked Amelia, hoping she could consider it clearly. After all, this was not just for fun, but Amelia didn't hesitate and put the gold leaf on it, then quickly press the confirm button.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;No matter how difficult it is, I must stay here until I find him.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her stubbornness infected Johnny, and he also put the golden leaf on it and quickly pressed the confirm button.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After confirming each other, electronic sounds came in succession&mdash;&mdash;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;2 groups of player 7, Lions confirmed.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;1 group of player 4, Dumbass confirmed.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia carefully glanced at Johnny, his face turned black with anger, and his clenched fists were secretly exerting force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;From now on, in addition to helping you find him, I also need to find the inviter for Group 4.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wanted to tear off the label of 'Dumbass' and firmly stick it on the inviter!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia withdrew her gaze and stared at the control console without saying a word, mainly afraid of setting herself on fire.</span></p></div>
