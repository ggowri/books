        <h1>Chapter 1894 You have to call him “cousin” too</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Herb learned the truth, he was shocked for one night and went crazy for another night. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two families were archenemies, but now, because of James, they became relatives. Who could accept this? </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Herb had wanted revenge, but Carson warned him that since they were relatives, they </span><span>should let it go unless someone from the Evans family, who had a grudge against the Clark family, continued to stab them in the back. Otherwise, they were not allowed to seek revenge on James.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Of course, Carson's advice was also because he believed that Herb, with his intelligence, could never defeat James. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In order to preserve the last bloodline of the Clark family, he persuaded Herb. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The reason for persuasion was that James was the one who had the most difficulty accepting this relationship, not their own Clark family members. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, no matter what, James had to call Carson "uncle".</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing this, Herb's eyes lit up instantly. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He then slapped his thigh and excitedly shook Carson's arm, saying, "Dad, you're brilliant!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Herb was extremely excited and immediately packed his things and rushed to Barcelona to share this good news with his cousin and cousin. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, he unexpectedly ran into them as soon as he stepped out of the airport gate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Herb was so happy that he ignored one thing and was too caught up in his excitement. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Cousin, James has to call my dad 'uncle', and he has to call your mom 'aunt', and also..." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Herb pointed his slender finger at Amelia, who was sitting silently in the back seat. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Although sister is not from the Clark family, her mom grew up in the Clark family, so she can be considered my aunt. Therefore, James has to call Amelia's mom 'aunt'..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying that, Herb covered his mouth and laughed uncontrollably. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The people in the car looked at each other, listening to the grating laughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Herb grabbed Johnny's clothes and mocked him, saying, "Cousin, you're younger than James, but now he has to call you 'brother'. Unexpected, right? Your mortal enemy has become your brother. Isn't that funny?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Johnny, who had finally managed to start the car, stared at Herb and said, "Do you want to die?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Herb was scared and quickly let go, then smirked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Johnny, feeling disgusted, straightened his wrinkled clothes and casually reminded Herb, "I call him 'cousin', so you have to call him 'cousin' too. Are you still in the mood to mock me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Herb's heart skipped a beat, as if he had just realized something.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The belated realization made Herb lose all sense of joy, and his expression instantly changed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After the car fell silent, James lifted his emotionless gaze and looked at Herb. "I'm happy to be your cousin, and my wife is also happy to be your cousin-in-law."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Herb treated Amelia as his sister because he thought she was beautiful and had a gentle personality, which was what he wanted in a sister. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't have any improper thoughts. However, when Johnny heard this, his face turned ugly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing this, Herb eagerly approached and said, "Cousin, what's wrong? Are you unhappy that my cousin is now your cousin, or that my cousin-in-law is now your </span><span>cousin-in-law?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His ability to change his words faster than anyone else was no different from a soldier surrendering under siege. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Johnny couldn't stand this type of person the most and said, "Do you want me to tear your mouth apart, or do you want to roll down yourself?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Herb, relying on James being present, was not afraid of Johnny at the moment and took the opportunity to vent his anger that had been suppressed for years. "Johnny bullies me, can you guys help me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia finally couldn't help but laugh at Herb's antics and said, "Johnny, for the sake of Herb being so cute, don't bully him anymore."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Johnny completely lost his temper and stepped on the gas pedal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James took the opportunity to embrace Amelia's waist and hold her in his arms. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He then opened the car window, allowing a gentle breeze to blow in, lifting Amelia's long hair that was draped over her waist, creating a beautiful scene that could rival a painting on James' handsome and elegant face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon seeing this, Herb quickly took out his phone, capturing this scene against the radiant sunlight and gentle breeze. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He then showed it to Johnny, asking, "Isn't it beautiful?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After glancing at the screen, Johnny's face twisted with jealousy.</span></p></div>
