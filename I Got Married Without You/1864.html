        <h1>Chapter 1864 Because of your selfishness</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James's face turned pale, and a mocking smile appeared at the corner of his mouth. "I don't want my wife to live in fear with me. I just want to spend the rest of my life with her. Is that wrong?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're not wrong." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then who is?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James raised an eyebrow and questioned Master Davies. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm not wrong, so it must be Zack's fault?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Master Davies glanced at him but remained silent. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James slowly straightened his body, placing his hands on his knees, and stared coldly at Master Davies. "Do you know how many lives were lost because of your selfishness?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James's finger landed on the list of S members placed on the table between them. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They were subjected to human experiments because of their desire for revenge for you." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And Zack, who grew up with me, died in Erebus without closure!" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your prot&eacute;g&eacute;, Holden, would have died there too if I hadn't pushed him away!" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking of the deceased, James's eyes turned crimson, and the veins on his clenched hands stood out. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Master Davies, Holden was your prot&eacute;g&eacute;. How could you sacrifice even him? What is your heart made of?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In Master Davies's impression, James was always good at controlling his emotions. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even in the face of the most infuriating situations, he remained calm and composed. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But at this moment, he was rare to see him yelling in anger for Zack, Holden, and the other members. "Although Holden is my prot&eacute;g&eacute;, his father is Bill's son."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're telling me all this, aren't you afraid I'll inform Matty?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If I didn't tell you, wouldn't you have found out anyway?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Master Davies countered, he sat up straight and looked at James. "Now that we've finished discussing trivial matters, let's talk about the real issue."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I know that no matter what, you will come back to Erebus to avenge Zack and the members." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I have only one request, help me kill Matty, and from then on, we owe each other </span><span>nothing."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You have the audacity to talk about owing each other nothing?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James stared at Master Davies, his face full of mockery, without any expression, recounting the past. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"When you were seven, if I hadn't saved you, you would have died on the streets." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Without my nurturing, you wouldn't have become the leader of the Evans family." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After speaking, Master Davies looked apologetically at James. "James, if Matty learns the truth, more people from S will die, including you." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"For how many S members Erebus has killed, I will make them pay." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As for your personal grudge with Matty, it's none of my business." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James coldly replied and then raised his chin towards the door. "If you don't want me to tie you up and take you to meet Matty right now, then leave immediately." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Being firmly rejected by James, Master Davies looked somewhat embarrassed. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't forget about your wife." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James suddenly raised his eyes, filled with a chilling murderous intent. "If you dare to touch her, I will kill you right now." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Master Davies knew that James wouldn't kill him at this moment. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, he still needed him to balance Matty on the battlefield. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They all understood each other's intentions, but Master Davies was a little worried. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Think it over. If you agree, I will send members from headquarters to assist you. Otherwise, don't blame me if you're short on manpower." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After uttering this threatening remark, Master Davies got up and left. However, when he opened the door, he saw Holden standing outside. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, I'm not a child that nobody wants..." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Holden took a heavy step forward and stood in front of Master Davies. "So, I have a father, but he was killed by your father."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Facing Holden, Master Davies's eyes clearly showed a hint of panic. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Holden, come back with me, and I'll tell you the truth." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Holden gave a cold smile of extreme disappointment, just like James. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No need, Master Davies." He pushed past Master Davies's shoulder and walked towards James. "Mr. Shawn, let's go and seek revenge."</span></p></div>
