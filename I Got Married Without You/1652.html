        <h1>Chapter 1652 Kate went to Germany</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kate finally succumbed to James' pressure and boarded the private plane, accompanied by her beloved son. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before arriving in Germany, Paul repeatedly reminded her not to say anything reckless when she meets Eva, or else he would go dismantle her house after finishing Eric's. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This threatening tactic was somewhat reminiscent of James, but Paul lacked the same level of audacity as him. Kate couldn't help but think that James would make a good son.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Frustrated by Paul's incessant babbling, Kate snapped, "Shut up!" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul finally fell silent and took the coffee handed to him by the flight attendant. Taking a sip, he said, "Mom, if you help me win Eva back, I promise to be obedient to you in the future." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James had specifically instructed him to say this before leaving, but Kate couldn't understand James' intention behind it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Surprised by Paul's unexpectedly sentimental words about Eva, Kate asked, "You really like Eva that much?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Holding his coffee, Paul corrected her, "It's not just like, it's love. I love her very much..." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In Kate's memory, Paul had always been carefree, so it was the first time she saw him so serious and sincere.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Subconsciously, Kate asked, "What would you do if you didn't have her?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Would he end up like Edith, suffering from depression, attempting suicide multiple times, and then after recovering, telling her, "I don't love Eva anymore, but I won't ever get married."? </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul turned his head to look at Kate sitting beside him and said solemnly, "Without her, I might want to die. Just like when I had that car accident last time, I thought if Eva didn't want me, it would be better to die..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kate's heart couldn't help but tremble, although she scolded, "You're so useless to want to die for a woman!" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul didn't mind her words and smirked, "It's genetic, who can I blame?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wasn't his father the same kind of person? He could unconditionally sacrifice everything for his wife. It was the noble gene of the Evans family, and he had inherited it. Could anyone blame him?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking of Eric being the same way, Kate felt somewhat relieved. "Starting from your uncle's generation, everyone has gone mad for love. There isn't a single normal person."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul chuckled, "Well, as long as you help me win Eva back, I will definitely treat you well." He couldn't come up with any other touching words, so he could only repeat the one James taught him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kate raised her gaze and looked at Paul, who was overjoyed. At the moment she boarded the plane, his smile never wavered. It was genuine happiness that made him say those words of filial piety, right? James was right, it was better to make her son grateful than resentful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps, after helping Paul, she could also seize the opportunity to gain her daughter's forgiveness. With these thoughts in mind, Kate's resistance waned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After getting off the plane, led by Paul, they arrived at the hospital. Kate learned that Eva came here to take care of her younger brother, who had grown up together with her in an orphanage. Kate didn't quite understand this behavior. It was just childhood friendship, so why put in so much effort?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't until they stood in front of the hospital room and saw Eva, acting like an older sister as she wiped Ryan's face and hands with a towel, that Kate realized her actions were affectionate but devoid of any ambiguity. She was simply taking care of </span><span>her loved one.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This version of Eva gave Kate the impression that she was quite sincere and loyal.</span></p></div>
