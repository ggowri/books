        <h1>Chapter 1734 Amelia thought of Stella again</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia came home and couldn't help but get red in the eyes when she saw Eva busy in the kitchen with Grace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She could have gone to James, but there were still two people here that she was most worried about, Eva and Grace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva had married Paul and had a husband to shelter her and a child to hold on to, so she didn't have to worry too much, but Grace ......</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had lost her parents and her adoptive father, and the only thing she had to rely on was her and James.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now James was gone, perhaps soon, she would also be gone, so what should Grace do?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia stood still for a long time before turning around and going upstairs, taking out her cell phone to send a message to Jocelyn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since the child snatching lawsuit, Jocelyn occasionally came to see Grace, perhaps because Amelia's tolerance and generosity, as well as the way to educate the child, let Jocelyn impressed, she became no longer bossy, but also much gentler.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just like all grandmothers visiting their granddaughters, she brought a bunch of stuff every time she came, pleasing Grace as well as her, so they got closer to each other.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But with Sumasa's life between them, the two didn't get too much closer, and as for whether or not Grace stayed close to her grandmother, Amelia never stopped her, after all, they were family too.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She sent a message to Jocelyn to come and see Grace from time to time, not entrusting Grace to her, just telling her that she was going on a business trip, which might be long, and that she was afraid that the child would be lonely, and that she wanted her to spend more time with Grace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She then called Neil and George and asked them to come and stay at Blue Bay Island for a while, Neil and George were unaware of the organizations S and Erebus, only that Amelia entrusted Grace to them every time she went away and they were happy to oblige.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't that Amelia didn't trust Eva, but Eva was pregnant and it would be exhausting with a baby, and when she thought about it, Amelia thought about Stella again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Stella was still around, then she would have left Grace in Stella's care, because Stella, who couldn't give birth, wanted the baby so badly and loved it so much ......</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia put down her cell phone, turned around and walked to the floor-to-ceiling window, looked at the bright, clear moon in the night sky, and after a long time, she reached out and touched her belly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stella, I am pregnant with a child, although a little late, but you can finally be a godmother.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Also, I won't be able to go to your grave for a while and tell you the good news, when </span><span>I return safely, I'll go to you again, okay?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia went downstairs and remained calm and stable as she accompanied Eva and Grace through dinner.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva was afraid that the calmer Amelia got, the more she thought about it, and wanted to stay and take care of her, but Amelia refused. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry, I'm fine, besides if anything happens to me, there's still Frank and Peter and the others at home." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva was still uneasy: "It's not good for them to take care of you, I'd better stay here and accompany you." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia patted Grace's little head, "With her sleeping with me, what are you worried about?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After she finished speaking, her line of sight fell on Eva's stomach again, "I heard Paul say that your fetus has been unstable lately, so it's better to hurry back and rest."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva touched her stomach and said unconcernedly, "Compared to the baby, I'm more worried about you now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia's heart nest warmed and she went forward to hug her, "Eva, don't worry, I'll be fine." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva rubbed her back, "I hope you really would be fine."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She hoped that Amelia wouldn't be like Stella, who said not to worry about her and ended up leaving quietly. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For Eva, Amelia was a family member who had grown up close to her, an inseparable presence, and she was terrified that something would happen to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia wrapped her arms around Eva and wouldn't let go but Amelia pushed her away ruthlessly, Eva tried to say something and Amelia pushed her out the door, Eva had no choice but to get in the car and told Amelia that she'd come back to see her tomorrow. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia nodded and waved at her, and I don't know if it was telepathic or what, but the car drove away, and Eva still peeked out of the window, looking at the diminishing voice ...... </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Amelia, it's a date... I'll see you first thing in the morning. "</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, Amelia's nose flared and her eyes soured, but pretending as if nothing had happened, she raised her hand again and waved it at Eva.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Good."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I'm sorry, Eva, I've lost my James and I want to go find him before I come back and be your sister. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She stood still for a long time until the car was far away before Amelia led Grace home, probably because Eva had instructed Grace to be obedient, and Grace was so good when Amelia tucked her in that she fell asleep in no time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After she put the Grace to bed, she got up and went to her desk, took out a pen and paper, left a letter, then took out the sleeping pills and mixed them into glasses of milk, one for Frank and one for Peter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was given to them at different times, two big men who did not have the slightest defense against her, tilted their heads and drank it down, and when they completely fell asleep, she dispatched the bodyguards who were guarding the outside as well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all this, Amelia drove out from Blue Bay Island with the prepared boxes and a bunch of birth control pills, but met Johnny's car halfway.</span></p></div>
