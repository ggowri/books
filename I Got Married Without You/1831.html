        <h1>Chapter 1831 The second condition</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matty nodded. "Even if Amelia is involved, there is no way for us to reconcile. So, Mr. Evans, you either give up revenge for Amelia's sake, or you completely separate from her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James' eyes suddenly turned cold. "Have you ever thought that if she knew my situation, even if we are forever opposed, she would choose me over you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matty's tone expressed that he now valued Amelia more than the founder of S. James, who had caught on to this, lowered his long eyelashes, covering the calculation that flashed through his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tomorrow, where do we meet?" James asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Right here," Matty replied. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as James was about to agree, planning to discuss the meeting the next day, Matty dashed his hopes with a single sentence. "I will reprogram the chip in your brain. If you break your word, I won't mind blowing your head off right then and there."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James' eyes revealed a sense of desolation. "You're not afraid of her hating you for the rest of her life?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matty stared at the mocking smile on James' lips and spoke softly. "If you don't want her to live in the pain of losing you, then you better cooperate."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two of them were engaged in a psychological battle, vying to see who cared more for Amelia. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was clear that, compared to Matty, James cared more for her. He was afraid that Amelia would be left with psychological scars, that she would live in perpetual agony, and that she would follow him. In their game of wits, James gradually began to yield.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I want to see her," James finally conceded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matty had already anticipated James' eventual compromise, and a victorious smile appeared on his face. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He took a step back and returned to the sofa, sitting down again before looking up at James.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We've finished discussing the first condition. Now, let's talk about the second condition," Matty said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James sneered. "What else do you have to threaten me with?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leaning back on the sofa, Matty struck a very lazy pose and looked down at James. "Amelia is very smart. She may not believe you, but she is kind and may forgive you. So, I will add a condition to her pregnancy."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James had not yet had time to feel joy before Matty's ruthless voice cut off all emotion. "After you meet her, tell her that your divorce agreement is valid and that you will never be with her. As for the reason, you can think of it yourself."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James' heart turned cold, and his blood seemed to flow backward. "You're going too far!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He tried to take his own life, but Dylan's gun was faster than him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I heard that she went through a lot to have a child. You probably wouldn't want her to accidentally miscarry due to stress, would you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James, in a passive position, clenched his fists tightly, staring at the masked man opposite him, wishing he could tear him apart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"For me, I have affection for Amelia, but that doesn't mean I have affection for her child," Matty said coldly and ruthlessly. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words cut through James like a knife, causing him to feel both pain and anger, making him feel so uncomfortable that he wished he were dead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The chip in your brain will explode if you leave Erebus by more than 100 meters. You can only stay here. Instead of waiting to die, you might as well agree to my terms. If you agree, I will open the remote monitoring program for the chip after you finish everything, and then you can leave Erebus, and I won't control your brain anymore. If you don't agree, I will find a way to make the child die. And don't worry, I have the means to make it all look seamless."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matty threatened James in the same way Emily had threatened him that day. In the end, it was always Amelia who was hurt.</span></p></div>
