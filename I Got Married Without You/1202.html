        <h1>Chapter 1202 Gloria, you’re so pathetic</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all doubts in James' mind were cleared, he began to ask his second question: "Who switched the medicine that Simon took before he died?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing this, the malice in Gloria's eyes instantly disappeared, and even her complexion became dull and lifeless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed that this matter had touched upon the most difficult part of her past, causing her to collapse in her chair, feeling weak all over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a long while, she slowly spoke: "It was me..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even James, who was ruthless and cunning, never thought that she was the one who switched the medicine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was stunned for a moment before he regained his composure and said incredulously, "You were so cruel as to harm your own son?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gloria's eyes turned red as she shook her head frantically and said, "No, that's not it. I switched the medicine for you, but somehow Simon took it instead. I clearly switched your medicine, how could he have taken it? How could this happen..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing this, Amelia felt a bit sorry for James and held onto his arm tightly, saying, "So she wanted to kill you..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Nonsense!" Gloria roared, pointing at him and saying, "Who said I wanted to kill him? That medicine would only lower his intelligence, not kill him. He's my toy to play with, I want to torture him for the rest of his life. How could I possibly want to kill him..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her son, who had finally taken the position of power, fell ill at a young age due to overwork and developed a brain disease.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James, who had always been regarded as the smartest child by Dominic, was secretly groomed by him to be a backup for the position of power in the future.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How could Gloria be willing to let the children of that couple take away what belonged to her son? So, when James fell ill, she switched his medicine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Who could have thought that the medicine that would accelerate the deterioration of the brain would be eaten by her own son!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James finally understood why Gloria wanted him dead but didn't directly kill.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It turned out that she wanted to keep him alive and torture him for a lifetime...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her intention extinguished the last bit of morality in his heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He held Amelia's hand, took a step forward, and looked coldly at the painful Gloria through the glass: "You are really pathetic."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How could Gloria have the face to live in this world when she wanted to harm him but ended up killing her own son with her own hands?</span></p></div>
