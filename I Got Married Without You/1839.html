        <h1>Chapter 1839: Can We Part Ways?</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes held stars, like a fog, masking the profound and dark depths of his stare.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia couldn't tell what James was thinking. But his words, they were suffocating. Amelia couldn't bear to hear them. Her nose stung, her eyes reddened, beyond her control.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is it because of Emily's threats again...?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just like before, Emily used her life to threaten James. He had no choice but to push Amelia away. But this time was different.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll handle Emily as the leader of Erebus. Don't be scared."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her voice, firm in her resolve to protect him, was warm in James's ears. It brought warmth but also shame.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Amelia, this time... Emily didn't threaten me. I... I want a divorce."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia stood still, her heart heavy, the sour sting in her nose, tears welling up in her eyes, and like pearls off a string, they fell.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why...?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing her cry, James felt a pang of panic. He raised his slender fingers, nervously wiping away her tears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Amelia, being with me... It's hard, isn't it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He gently wiped her tears, softly called her name, and even looked at her tenderly. But his next words were far from tender.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Zack died here because of me. Many members of S died here too. The burden I carry... it's too much. If you stay with me, you'll suffer. So..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He paused, his voice trembling when he spoke again. It felt like something was slicing at his throat, cutting inch by inch, painfully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Can we... part ways?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Through the blurry veil of tears, Amelia looked at the man before her, almost unable to believe that the words 'part ways' had come from his mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The first time he pulled out a breakup agreement, Amelia walked away with grace, no fuss.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She figured she could let go and forget about James when he stopped seeking her, but he kept coming back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he returned from abroad, he pleaded with her, claiming he'd die without her. Amelia etched these words into her heart and bones and loved him just as intensely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, she too would die without him. But he'd rather see her die than part ways, just because he was </span><span>afraid</span><span> she'd get tired?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Taking a deep breath to suppress the dull pain, Amelia reached out again to hold his hand, gripping it tightly as if offering strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've managed through all the fatigue before. What matters now is not whether I'm tired, but that I can join you in seeking revenge and face everything together."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feeling her strength, James lowered his eyes, hiding the bitterness within.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Since Matty declared you as 1-1, you and I have been on opposing sides."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only then did Amelia realize this, her heart skipping a beat. She quickly grasped his hand and explained frantically, "I only used this as an excuse to enter Erebus because Matty wouldn't let me see you. I didn't mean to oppose you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment she saw the golden leaf, she thought he was restrained. Her first instinct was to find him without considering the implications.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm sorry. I should have thought more before making hasty decisions."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her regret mirrored in James' eyes seemed particularly cruel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Knowing it had nothing to do with her, yet pushing her away with such an excuse, he felt utterly weak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">James, you can't even protect your own life, your wife.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">If you're so weak, why not just die?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he had to protect the child and avenge Zack. He had to stay alive!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The viciousness in his eyes was both defeated and defiant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He concealed all his grief, reaching out his other hand to gently stroke her hair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even if you're not against me, you're still Matty's granddaughter, and you took his place. Both of these roles are in opposition to me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words, spoken so lightly, drew a line between them, making them instant enemies with different stances.</span></p></div>
