        <h1>Chapter 1731 You are pregnant</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once a person returned to normal, they would be able to accept things that they couldn't before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as Gigi saw Zack's broken bones, she realized with absolute clarity that he was dead. Really dead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She stared at the broken bones for a while, then slowly pushed away the stunned Johnny. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She put her foot on the cold floor and leaned against the edge of the bed, slowly squatting down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her slender fingers trembled as they touched the bones, and she could almost see the gruesome image of Zack being devoured by the snake. Even just a fleeting glimpse was enough to make Gigi shudder in fear...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She trembled as she picked up a bone and held it in her arms, like a statue suddenly losing the ability to speak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Discovering that her lover had died in a tragic way was even more devastating than just finding out about his death. Gigi felt like her world was collapsing and powerless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, Gigi was unable to even cry, just holding onto her broken bones, losing all ability to speak and feel, numbly crouching on the ground like a fragile porcelain doll...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Amelia watched Gigi go from pain to madness and then to silence, her heart couldn't help but ache. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After standing still for a while, she took a step forward and crouched down in front of Gigi. Once again, she reached out and gently touched her hair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Miss Brook, you're still carrying Zack's child in your belly. You need to think about the child and take good care of yourself."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for Zack and James, she went to find them herself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gigi was actually much more fragile than Amelia. At least at this moment, Amelia was like a dim light in the morning, burning herself to illuminate others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gigi, who was illuminated by the beam of light, slowly raised her numb eyes and stared blankly at Amelia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's the point of having a child without Zack?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's the witness of your love with him, only when you and the child are alive, will Zack live forever."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without James' protection, Amelia grew into a towering tree within just a few days.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She helped Gigi up and gently guided her back onto the hospital bed, then looked at her with determined eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"For Zack's sake, for the sake of your child, you must take care of yourself no matter what."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gigi looked at Amelia, who was incredibly strong, with a dim and lifeless gaze, as if </span><span>searching for a glimmer of comfort and courage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Will Zack live on forever as long as my child and I are alive?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia nodded lightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay, I promise you, I will take good care of myself."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia finally reached out and gently stroked Gigi's hair once again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, she was James' cousin, which was basically like being her own cousin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She should have loved and cherished her cousin, and also given her hope and strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Gigi's emotions calmed down, Amelia gave a few more reminders before getting up and leaving.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Amelia."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she reached the doorway, Gigi called out to her again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I had no idea that Zack secretly followed James, and I feel really sorry for that slap."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia's lips curled up as she turned around and gave Gigi a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's okay."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She left these words behind, picked up her heavy steps, and quickly left the ward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She arrived at the lobby on the first floor and registered, hoping to get a prescription for sleeping pills from the doctor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had to leave, but first she needed to get rid of Frank and Peter. As for those bodyguards, they were easy to handle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Frank and Peter were following her closely, so she had to give them some sleeping pills to let them get a good night's rest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>During this time, she couldn't fall asleep no matter what she did. The doctor would definitely prescribe some sleeping pills to help her sleep.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After the doctor asked about her symptoms, he told her to go and get a blood test done.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After finishing her examination, Amelia waited for a while and received the news that her report was ready. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She then went back to the consultation room and asked the doctor to prescribe medication for her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The doctor gave her a stern look after reading the blood test report.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're pregnant, why are you still taking sleeping pills?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I...am pregnant?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The doctor nodded and then typed a bunch of medicine names on the computer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your fetal condition is a bit unstable. I'll prescribe some medicine for you. Go home and rest well, don't overexert yourself."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The doctor's voice echoed in Amelia's ears, slowly bringing her back from her shocked thoughts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She should have known it earlier, she hasn't had her period for several months in a row, so she must be pregnant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But during this time, her heart was completely tied to James, and she didn't pay any attention to her own health.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly being told that she was pregnant, she didn't know how to react. It seemed like whether she was happy or not didn't even matter anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She reached out and touched her stomach, finding it hard to accept that she was pregnant at a time like this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But this was the child she had been longing for for a very long time, she should be happy...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But without James, she didn't have anyone to share her joy with. How could she be happy?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What should she do?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Should she follow her advice to Gigi and stay at home to take care of herself, or should she go against all odds and find the father of her child?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Who could tell her the answer?</span></p></div>
