        <h1>Chapter 1776 Pay a thousand times over</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James's eyelashes trembled slightly, as if he had just regained consciousness, and slowly moved towards Emily's face. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the blink of an eye, Emily's finger that was lifting his chin was instantly broken! </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a crack, her knuckles shattered!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah&mdash;" When Emily screamed in pain, she felt a tearing sensation in her wrist. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James grabbed her wrist and broke it too! Before Emily could even bear the pain, she felt a cold hand gripping her neck. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The suffocating feeling hit her, and her gloating face turned red and purple in just a second... </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If someone hadn't been controlling his mind, Emily would have been killed by him at that moment. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Taking advantage of James's pain as he fell to the ground holding his head, Emily hurriedly escaped. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She clutched her neck and, unable to get up, awkwardly shuffled backward. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After creating enough distance, she cradled her injured left hand and took deep breaths. Once she had recovered, she walked back in. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mr. Ben probably heard what she had just said, so this time he didn't help her up, just looked at her disappointedly. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emily seemed to realize something and quickly grabbed Mr. Ben's hand. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ben, I was just talking nonsense, don't believe it. The only person I love now is you." "Is that so?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a cold laugh, Mr. Ben pulled out a knife and threw it in front of Emily. "Then go stab him to show your determination." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emily hesitated, wanting to use her injured hand as an excuse, but she saw Mr. Ben glaring at her with bloodshot eyes. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mr. Ben was a lunatic, and if he realized she had never stopped loving James, he would surely kill her. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After weighing the pros and cons, Emily grabbed the knife and, standing up, walked over to James. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"James, if you won't accept my love, then just die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without any hesitation, Emily raised the knife and stabbed it fiercely into James's thigh! The man who had fainted several times on the ground had no reaction, his dark eyes staring fixedly at the screen. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had a baby in her belly, a baby she had worked so hard to conceive, a baby she risked danger for just to tell him she was pregnant. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But ...... the baby she had worked so hard to conceive, he did not show any trace of happiness, just looked at her indifferently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In his heart, James asked himself, how could he be so cruel? He should be gentler to her in the future, be kind to her and the child, and not be so self-righteous... </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But, was there a future between them? </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had said she would never see him until she died, and she meant it. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The door to the solitary confinement room opened and closed, the only beam of light faded away, leaving endless darkness. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lying in a pool of blood, James quietly thought about the moment when Amelia was pushed into the sea by her biological father, what was she thinking, did she miss him? He thought she would. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just like he missed her, to the point of wanting to die, going crazy, and wishing he could find her right now! </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But could he easily let go of those who hurt her? </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't. He wanted them to pay a thousand times over! </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wanted to tear out their insides, drain their blood, and pour it into the sea as revenge for her and their child! </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James's fingers in the pool of blood clenched into a fist, the strong and powerful back of his hand, with bulging veins like a bloodthirsty dragon ready to strike! </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the quiet space, there was a rhythmic tapping, repeating the same sentence over and over. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She killed my sister's </span><span>daughter,</span><span> I will definitely push her into the snake pit. Pull yourself together, wait for my message."</span></p></div>
