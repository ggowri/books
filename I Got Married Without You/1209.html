        <h1>Chapter 1209 We don’t need a child</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at the cold and aloof figure, Stella stood still in place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had once made a false report for Amelia. Is James implying something about her?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stella lowered her gaze and looked at the displayed numbers. She slightly curved her lips and thought to herself, "Is James implying something about me? Good!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James had been gone for a while and when he returned, Amelia had fallen asleep. "Why were you gone for so long?" she asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man who had prepared his hands after finishing his business sat down next to her with a calm expression. "The restroom here isn't very clean," he said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia had no suspicions and hugged his arm, leaning her head on his shoulder. She spoke softly to him, "Earlier, you asked me what I would do if Alice was the one adopted by the Clark family. I thought about it and I don't want a child. I just want to be with you for the rest of my life, as long as you're here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James: ...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If only she had said that earlier, he wouldn't have had to go find Stella...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was somewhat helpless and reached out to hold her waist, gently pinching it. "In the future, when I ask you something, answer me promptly."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia, who didn't understand what was going on, leaned on his shoulder and looked at him with her head tilted. "I'll answer you if you ask me something, but you have to give me time to think about it..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wasn't quick to react and needed to think things through in her mind first. Otherwise, the words that came out without going through her brain might hurt someone, embarrass herself, or break her promises.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing her words, James raised his hand and touched her face. His eyes were filled with tenderness as he said, "Next time, I will wait for you to finish speaking."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, three knocks were heard from outside the door, followed by Stella's voice: "James, Amelia, the appraisal report is out--"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James replied, "Come in," and Stella pushed the door open.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing the report in her hand, Amelia became nervous and clenched her fists.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although she was prepared for either outcome, she was still nervous at the moment of revelation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stella, with a mischievous look, glanced at James and opened the bag containing the report in front of them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's the result?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Compared to James&rsquo; calmness, Amelia was much more anxious. Before Stella could hand over the report, she went up and asked directly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stella pulled out the report and handed it to Amelia. "You and James have no blood relationship..."</span></p></div>
