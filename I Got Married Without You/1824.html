        <h1>Chapter 1824 Extreme love and hatred</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia looked at Matty in this state, feeling a chill in her heart. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His hatred had transformed from seeking personal revenge to seeking revenge against the general public. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was why Erebus offered a variety of deadly experiences, to satisfy his bloodthirst. Amelia was well aware that Matty's mind, twisted by hatred, now saw human lives as insignificant. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She remained silent, simply observing the old man with white hair and bloodshot eyes, slowly coming to understand a truth: sometimes loving someone too much is not a good thing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, Amelia, do you think I'm wrong?" Matty put away his memories of the past and looked calmly at the face in front of him, so similar to Sophia's.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You shouldn't sacrifice so many lives for the sake of revenge," Amelia paused for a moment, then continued to explain, "You should find the person who killed Sophia and seek revenge, rather than involve innocent people."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can't find them!" Matty's voice rose with agitation. "Do you know how that feels? I want revenge, but I can't find my enemies. This helplessness is driving me crazy!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Will you disband Erebus once you find your enemies?" This question calmed Matty down, and he stared at Amelia, hesitated for a moment, and then nodded gently. "No one wants to live in hatred forever."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once he had taken his revenge, he could follow Sophia and be free forever. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Previously, Holden had mentioned not knowing if the person behind Erebus had a grudge against James or Master Davies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now that James had joined Erebus and become the mastermind, it meant that the person behind Erebus didn't have a grudge against James. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This left only Master Davies, but since Master Davies was of the same generation as her mother, how could he have been involved in Sophia's murder? </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She felt that the problem lay with the S organization, so she subtly probed Matty for information about the S organization.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I heard that the S organization was not established for a long time, and Sophia's death happened many years ago." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she asked this question, Amelia was not only inquiring about Erebus, but also trying to ascertain if Matty knew about James's identity as S.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How do you know the time when the S organization was established?" Matty asked, and Amelia breathed a sigh of relief, not detecting any falsehood in his words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A friend who entered with me is the vice president of the Eurasian Union Chamber of Commerce, and he knows a little bit about it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is that so?" Matty smiled and nodded. "I know him, Johnny. He's a good kid, willing to sacrifice his life for you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing about the bloody events in Erebus, Amelia's anger was difficult to contain. </span><span>"You should be grateful that someone saved him, otherwise I wouldn't be sitting here now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matty spread his hands in apology. "If I had known earlier that you were my granddaughter, you and your friend wouldn't have had any trouble in Erebus."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia ignored him and quickly returned to the previous topic. "The timeline of the S organization's establishment doesn't match up. The killer of Sophia should not be from the S organization."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's impossible," Matty denied outright. "The original S was called 'darkness' and has been around for a long time. Later, for some reason, all the members of darkness were sacrificed, and that's when it was renamed to S."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, Amelia was stunned. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James had said that Master Davies established S for a woman, who was James's biological mother, Ashley, the illegitimate daughter of The Clark family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If this was true, then Master Davies had been deceiving James all along. If Master Davies had been deceiving James since childhood, then Sophia's death might be related to Master Davies. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if he wasn't directly involved, it was likely connected to the previous organization. The question was, what was the reason behind it?</span></p></div>
