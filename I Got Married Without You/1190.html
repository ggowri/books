        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking into her clear eyes, James didn't know how to speak, so he simply hugged her tightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He held her tightly, as if afraid of losing her, using great force, wishing to merge her into his bones.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every time he hugged her like this, it showed that he was very uneasy. This uneasiness came from his conversation with Dominic. She didn't know what Dominic had said to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia hugged him and rested her chin on his shoulder, softly saying, "Honey, if you have anything on your mind, you must tell me. Don't force yourself to bear it alone."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James's lips curved into a bitter smile, his complex emotions making him uncontrollable. He lowered his head and nibbled on her neck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His kiss was intense, moving up along her collarbone, and when he reached her lips, he went crazy, seeking the fragrance in her mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia was kissed until she couldn't breathe, her waist and hands held tightly by him, and her lower body under his control.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, her clothes were removed, and they were making love on the sofa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment James entered her body, a sense of guilt surged up, causing him to stop.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stared at Amelia's confused eyes and suddenly laughed lightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It turned out that their cousin relationship really affected him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing James stop and laugh, Amelia was very worried. "Honey... what's wrong with you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Painfully, he hugged her tightly, his voice trembling. "Amelia, tell me, why can't we be together?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, her heart sank bit by bit. "What... do you mean?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Can't be together, does he want to divorce her?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just because he had a conversation with his grandfather, does he want to divorce her?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She hugged J's waist with some fear and said, "You promised me forever, don't leave me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James didn't know that she was falling more and more in love with him. If he left her, she might not be able to go on living...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The fear in her eyes caused a dull pain in his heart. "I want you, Amelia. I want you," he said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia was a little stunned as she looked at the man with bloodshot eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"James, what's wrong with you?" she asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't answer, but just vented his frustration on her wildly until he was exhausted...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man brushed aside her sweat-soaked hair and kissed her forehead.</span></p></div>
