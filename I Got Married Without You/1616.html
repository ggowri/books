        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't answer Amelia's video call. Instead, she reached out her hand and </span><span>muted </span><span>her phone</span><span>. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, everything fell silent and </span><span>time seemed to have stopped</span><span>. It was so quiet that she could only hear the </span><span>chirps</span><span> </span><span>of birds outside the window.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She </span><span>was in so much pain </span><span>and</span><span> </span><span>her blood</span><span> </span><span>was</span><span> slowly seeping out, just like </span><span>that </span><span>when Erin bled to death. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A faint smile appeared on her pale lips. She</span><span> finally</span><span> realized how painful it was to wait for the blood to flow dry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead of struggling, she relaxed her body and leaned against the floor-to-ceiling window. Her clear eyes slowly shifted to the sea outside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Erin must have seen her from this position and knew she wouldn't turn back. That's why he didn't finish writing his last words</span><span>. He</span><span> probably thought no one would bury him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tears gradually filled Stella's clear eyes, mixed with a sense of relief. Memories of her entire life flashed through her mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought she would remember most of the moments </span><span>involving</span><span> </span><span>Karen, but instead, the images that flashed </span><span>across her mind </span><span>were all </span><span>about</span><span> </span><span>Erin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For example, </span><span>back when they were still little,</span><span> </span><span>Erin </span><span>would follow</span><span> </span><span>behind her, protecting her from falling with his small hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Or when Erin made her cry, he would secretly ask the old butler for macarons and place them on her desk.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And even when Erin grew up, he would come to her room after she fell asleep and sneakily kiss her without her noticing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even at school, Erin couldn't help but use a book to shield himself as he leaned down and stole a kiss from her on the desk.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was only now that Stella realized her first kiss was taken by Erin, not by those thugs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She smiled, tears streaming down her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Through her blurry vision, she saw Erin in a black suit, walking towards her against the bright light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After standing in front of her, he knelt down on one knee and gently touched her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stella, I had your blueberry pie and it was delicious."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stella nodded in a daze</span><span>, saying, </span><span>"In the next life, I'll still make it for you, alright?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Erin lowered his long eyelashes, seemingly contemplating whether he wanted to meet in the next life.</span><span> </span><span>He didn't immediately give an answer, but just </span><span>pursed</span><span> his lips and smiled faintly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You've already been with me for 29 days, that's enough</span><span>,</span><span>"</span><span> He replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In other words, he didn&rsquo;t actually want to meet her in the next life, if there was actually one.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A bit panicked, </span><span>Stella tried to grab Erin's hand, but she only grabbed emptiness. There was no Erin, just a figment of her imagination.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feeling disappointed, she let go of her hand. "Erin, if I say I still love you, can we meet again in the next life?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one answered Stella, not even herself, unsure if there would be a next life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stella's body gradually stiffened as her blood continued to drain. Soon, her eyes lost </span><span>their </span><span>focus</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before falling into complete darkness, Stella saw her eighteen-year-old </span><span>self holding</span><span> a love letter, blushing, and approaching the young boy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Erin, I like you. Can </span><span>you be my boyfriend</span><span>?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The boy leaning against the tree beneath him glanced at the love letter in her hand with dissatisfaction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Gosh! You&rsquo;re so old-school, still</span><span> </span><span>w</span><span>riting </span><span>love letters</span><span> and stuff</span><span>."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This made Stella's face even redder, even her ears turning red.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, </span><span>yes</span><span> or no</span><span>?"</span><span> She asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Erin took the love letter from Stella's hand and pulled her into his arms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I accept."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, Stella smiled happily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stella thought, if it weren't for that incident when she was eighteen, this could have been her and Erin's ending...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately, life didn&rsquo;t offer second chances.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The ending for her and Erin could only be one killed and one suicide</span><span> b</span><span>ecause </span><span>their love and entanglement were </span><span>destined to end from the beginning</span><span>.</span></p></div>
