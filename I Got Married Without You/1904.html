        <h1>Chapter 1904 Seeing the Baby</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All of that was for the future. Right then, the most important thing was Amelia giving birth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So James came back from Aronland and went straight to Paul's house to pick up his wife.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>During the two days that James was away, Amelia was constantly fighting with Eva to hold the child.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luckily, Paul had a soft spot for girls. As long as Amelia didn't fight with him for their daughter's affection, he was fine with anything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the two of them around, Eva naturally had her hands free. She lay in bed, resting peacefully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When James came in from outside the villa, Paul was talking to Amelia while holding a child.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Amelia, James has given my child a nickname. How about I give your child a nickname too?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After expertly cradling the baby, Paul freed up one hand, pointed at Dane, and then at Sophie in Amelia's arms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How about the name Faye? What do you think?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Not so great."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Amelia could even respond, a cold, undeniable voice echoed from behind her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both of them turned around at the same time, only to see an incredibly handsome man walking towards them, basking in the warm winter sun.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man walked up to Amelia, extended his slender, fair hand, and took the child away, handing him back to Paul.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The name you've chosen sounds terrible."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul was so angry that he was grinding his teeth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've never seen someone as hypocritical as you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James ignored Paul, leaned over, and, in a princess carry, lifted Amelia straight off the sofa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's go home."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia was somewhat reluctant to leave Paul's children, but her husband had just returned from abroad. It was time for her to go home.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only then did James secure his hold on Amelia, heading outside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Faye!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had only taken a few steps when suddenly, a deafening sound of resistance from Paul echoed from behind him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't care, I'm going to call your child Faye!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia tilted her head slightly, looking past James' strong and muscular arm, to see Paul holding a child in his arms. She couldn't help but smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James couldn't care less whether Paul resisted or not. He left without looking back, holding the woman in his arms, leaving Paul yelling in place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You just wait, every time I see your kid, Faye, I'm going to call out to her. I'll do it for the rest of my life!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James held Amelia, gently placing her in the car and carefully fastening her seatbelt. Only then did he instinctively reach for her waist, asking, "Does it hurt?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia gave a slight shake of her head, "Paul has hired so many nannies. Eva doesn't need all of them, so I've had them help me with massages. I've been feeling much better these past couple of days."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James' thick eyelashes drooped as he stared at Amelia's belly. "Since you've been pregnant, I haven't been by your side to take care of you. I want to personally take care of you before the baby is born. After the baby is born, I'll hire professionals. Don't worry, I'll definitely hire more than Paul did."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia laughed, "You're so naive, even comparing yourself to Paul."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man also laughed, "I can't let you feel wronged."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia shifted slightly, resting her head on his broad, strong shoulder. "How could I ever feel wronged when you treat me so well?" she said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James pulled her into his arms, holding the petite Amelia tightly, "It's not good enough yet, but it will be better in the future."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia flashed a sweet smile, "Actually, as long as you're by my side, that's more than enough."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James' dark eyes dimmed, but fearing Amelia would notice something was off, he quickly changed the subject: "The prenatal check-up is all set. Shall we go to the hospital first, then head home?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since Amelia found out she was pregnant, she hadn't gone for any prenatal check-ups. However, after leaving Erebus, she had two check-ups and the baby was healthy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seven months in, Amelia had to go for prenatal check-ups every two to three weeks. It was time for her next check-up, so it was convenient to swing by the hospital. Most importantly, this was the first time James was accompanying Amelia for her prenatal check-up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was the hospital that James invested in, and it was also Stella's hospital. Walking in here again without Stella, it felt like everything had changed. However, the newly appointed director was also a very outstanding and capable woman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though the newly appointed dean wasn't Stella, Amelia could always see the Stella who once examined her through her bustling figure. Indeed, when it comes to life and death, just one scene can easily touch the deep longing in one's heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia looked at the dean who was personally conducting her check-up and couldn't help but say to James, "After the baby is born and grows a little older, I want to take the child to meet Stella."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man paused for a moment, then nodded, gently saying, "I'll stay with you," before falling silent. By his side, he had already lost two people, Zack and Stella. Every time their names were mentioned, it was with a sense of regret.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The new dean had also heard about Stella's exploits. Although she was curious about Stella's </span><span>experiences, she didn't ask much and focused solely on her inspection.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When the 4D ultrasound displayed the image of the baby, the dean pointed to the screen, "Mr. Evans, look, this is what the baby looks like."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The first time James saw the baby, his icy eyes began to melt bit by bit. He wasn't sure if it was the baby's hand or foot that touched his heartstrings, but his eyes suddenly welled up with tears.</span></p></div>
