        <h1>Chapter 1643 A sense of unease</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What was the difference between this scene and when she saw Daniel cheating before? Well, there was a difference. She didn't love Daniel as much, so seeing this scene only made her angry. But she really liked Paul, so seeing someone she liked making love with the other woman broke her heart...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Eva was humiliated by Kate, she never shed a tear. But now, her eyes were swollen and tears were flowing uncontrollably like an endless fountain. She wiped away the tears on her face, determined not to cry, but the tears kept falling...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her vision was blurry and she couldn&rsquo;t see clearly what the person on the bed was doing. But the woman's soft and tearful voice in her ears made her uncomfortable, so she covered her ears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Turns out, while Paul was being intimate with her, he was also involved with Elsie. No, even when he wasn't being intimate with her, he was still involved with Elsie... Like last time, when she was drugged by Jayden and came out of the hotel, didn't she see him hugging Elsie?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But... what did she mean to him? </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul, what am I to you?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Paul, is it comfortable?" Elsie intentionally asked while covering Paul with a blanket, then she pinched his waist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul, who was unconscious and feeling pain, made a hoarse sound.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing that familiar voice, Eva felt like she's in an icy cave, and her hands and feet turned cold. With tears in her eyes and a feeling of nausea, she ran out like a madman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kate was right, her son was different from James. He was never faithful in relationships... He could say "I love you" on this woman's bed and then said "I will marry you" on another woman's bed. Even Eva, who tolerated him endlessly, couldn't make him change...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only this time, Eva thought that Paul loved her so he wouldn't treat her like before. But she forgot that someone like Paul, a playboy, could never focus on just one person. She was delusional, even prepared to beg his mother, but she didn't realize that other women were already begging...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After running downstairs, Eva quickly got into her car, but her trembling body made it hard for her to start the car. She cried in a hurry, comforting herself that it's alright, it's just Paul, nothing will happen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elsie, who was naked, pulled back a corner of the curtain and peeked through the gap at the car downstairs. She couldn&rsquo;t see the person inside the car's reaction, but she knew that Eva, this old woman, wouldn&rsquo;t get what she can't have!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elsie closed the curtain and looks at Paul. He was drunk and sleeping, completely unresponsive. She wanted to do something, but she couldn&rsquo;t. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maybe... lying next to Paul and pretending to sleep with him when he wakes up, then making him take responsibility?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as this idea came up, Elsie immediately dismissed it. Paul was too smart, he would see through it as soon as he wakes up. If Paul found out she did something like this, he wouldn't just deal with her, he would go to Eva to explain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It's better to let Eva misunderstand everything. Someone liked Eva wouldn&rsquo;t question Paul, she would just choose to give up. And what Elsie wanted was for Eva to give up. Only when Eva gave up did she have a chance, right?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When she was dating Paul, she also seduced James. With this in mind, Paul wouldn&rsquo;t give her any more chances. After Paul ruthlessly exposed her last time, Elsie knew that her dream of marrying into the Evans Family was completely shattered...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn&rsquo;t have much chance, but she couldn&rsquo;t let Eva have a chance either. Once Eva retreated, her own dissatisfaction would turn into satisfaction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking of this, a cold smile formed on Elsie's thin lips. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva, if you want to compete with me for a man, you better hone your skills in this circle for a few more years...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next day, Paul woke up from his drunken state and saw himself lying in the apartment. Thinking that Anthony must have brought him back, he didn&rsquo;t pay much attention to it. He supported his pounding headache and went to the bathroom...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After cleaning himself up, Paul casually made a cup of coffee and opened his computer. He looked at the news in the company for a while, but since there was nothing particularly important, he closed the computer and went to find his phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finding his phone in his suit pocket, he opened it and saw that Eva called him last </span><span>night. Paul was momentarily stunned, then overjoyed. The missed call from Eva meant that she had taken him off her blacklist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He quickly called back, but no one answered after several attempts... Paul frowned, put down his phone, and felt a sense of unease creeping into his heart...</span></p></div>
