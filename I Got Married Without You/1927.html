        <h1>Chapter 1927 Amelia forgot about James</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva slumped into a chair, feeling desperate. "Dr. Lewis, has she lost her memory? How does she remember things from before she turned eighteen?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dr. Lewis snapped back to attention. "I don't know, we need to run some tests."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva immediately stood up. "I'll go find the doctor and arrange the tests as soon as possible. It would be best if we can cure her before James comes back."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva truly cared for James, which was why she hoped the doctors could help Amelia regain her memory before James returned.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, after the tests, the doctors informed her that Amelia's amnesia was caused by a temporary loss of memory due to a brain hemorrhage.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This meant that Amelia only remembered things from before she turned eighteen and couldn't recall anything after that.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing this result, Eva was a bit stunned. "When will she be able to recover then?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The doctor put down the report and replied, "The timing of recovery depends on the patient's condition."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva asked, "Can medication be used to treat her?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The doctor said, "Medication won't work for memory. It requires stimulation."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stimulation... Eva thought of the baby Amelia had fought so hard to give birth to and quickly got up.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For the past six months, Eva had been taking care of the baby, even breastfeeding him herself without any help from others.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thanks to her and Paul's careful attention, the baby had grown chubby and healthy. She believed that when Amelia saw the adorable baby, her memory would surely be restored. So, she hurried home to hold the baby before James returned.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Little did she know that as soon as she left the hospital, she ran into Ryan. "Eva, how is Amelia today? Any signs of her waking up?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva paused her steps, her expression complicated. "She did wake up..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing that Amelia had woken up, a glimmer of hope appeared in Ryan's dim eyes. "That's great, I'll go see her."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Ryan turned around in excitement, Eva grabbed his arm. "She did wake up, but she has amnesia. She only remembers things from before she turned eighteen."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ryan froze, finding it hard to believe. "How is that possible?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's due to the brain hemorrhage."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After answering, Eva added, "It's temporary amnesia, she will recover."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her implication was that it was different from Ryan's situation back then.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, she reminded Ryan not to take advantage of Amelia's amnesia when he saw her later.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ryan was smart enough to understand the meaning behind Eva's words, but he couldn't help feeling a bit disappointed...</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva, who had always loved him since childhood, had witnessed firsthand how much James loved Amelia. Her heart had shifted towards that man.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With both people who had been by his side since childhood leaving, how could Ryan not feel upset?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stood still, silent for a moment, then smiled lightly. "Eva, don't worry, it's impossible between me and her."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This seemingly carefree smile pierced Eva's heart. She wanted to apologize, but Ryan pushed her hand away and walked away.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As someone who had also experienced amnesia, Ryan could empathize the most. He would never take advantage of Amelia's amnesia to rekindle their relationship.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One day, her memory would recover, and they would have to go through another heart-wrenching separation. Why bother?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ryan didn't have any joyful thoughts as he walked into the hospital and entered the ward where Amelia was.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The doctors were still examining her, and Amelia was cooperating obediently.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When the doctor moved her head to the side, facing the door, Amelia saw Ryan, a tall man in a black coat, standing at the doorway, silently watching her.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ryan."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although she was puzzled, the teenage boy from her memories had turned into a man within just six months, and even looked a bit weathered, she could still recognize her Ryan with just one glance.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why did you come so late?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After calling out Ryan's name, Amelia smiled and asked, her pure eyes no longer containing James' figure, only Ryan.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was the dream that Ryan often had in the middle of the night, now coming true. He should be happy, but he couldn't find any happiness.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Ryan's lack of joy upon seeing her awake, Amelia thought something must have happened to him and furrowed her pretty brows lightly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ryan, is my medical bill too expensive and causing you too much pressure?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She paused for a moment, reaching out to remove the tubes from her body.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Doctors, I don't want treatment anymore. I want to go home with my boyfriend."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The doctors were all James' people, and upon hearing Amelia's words, they exchanged glances, understanding the amnesiac patient's perspective.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They just didn't understand why she had to lose her memory precisely when she loved someone the most. What would Mr. Evans do in this situation?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You had a major hemorrhage from giving birth. How can you just stop treatment?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ryan walked over and held her hand to stop her from removing the tubes.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Amelia heard him say this, she couldn't believe it and raised her frail face, staring at Ryan.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Did I give birth to a child?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mhm."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Ryan nod, Amelia's doubts gradually faded away.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had no recollection at all. It seemed that what Eva and the doctors said about her amnesia was true.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She lowered her head, trying hard to remember giving birth, but she couldn't recall anything. Instead, she got a headache and decided to give up.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She reached out and grabbed Ryan's hand as he was about to leave, looking up at him. "Did I have a child with you?"</span></p></div>
