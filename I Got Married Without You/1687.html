        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva reluctantly agreed when Paul asked her to kiss him. "There are still people around," she said. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva used to call Amelia her BFF, but now she referred to her as just a person. Even </span><span>the usually patient Amelia couldn't help but roll her eyes. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't mind her," Paul said. Just as his words trailed off, a tall figure walked in from outside the castle. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul quickly bent down and brought his handsome face close to Eva's. "Give me a quick kiss," he urged. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unaware that James had entered, Eva tilted her head back and quickly kissed him on the face. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul's face lit up with a smile as he held Eva and turned to face the seemingly cold-hearted James. "James, you're back?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Facing the secretly triumphant Paul, James glanced indifferently at the two of them before walking over to Amelia. "Don't let mentally unstable people in here anymore." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a brief moment of confusion, Amelia spoke up for Eva. "Eva is perfectly fine." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James sat down on the sofa and gave Paul a sideways glance. "I wasn't talking about Ms. Miller." Paul responded, "So you're talking about me then?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Raising an eyebrow, James replied, "Since you identify with it, then yes, I am talking about you." Paul fell silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul took Eva by the hand and walked towards the door. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, as if remembering something, he turned to look at the couple who were already embracing each other. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though Paul had seen them together several times before, he couldn't help but feel shy. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unable to control himself, Paul reached out to cover Eva's eyes. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With her eyes covered, Eva glanced at Paul with a smirk.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In three days, Eva and I will have our wedding. Remember to prepare a gift," Paul announced before quickly leaving Blue Bay Island with Eva. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia and James watched their backs and exchanged a smile. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Three days later, Paul and Eva's wedding took place on a luxury yacht. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The yacht, numbered 37-1314520, was purchased by Paul at a huge cost. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia found the number to be quite special, as if it symbolized Eva and Paul's lifelong commitment. The wedding was grand, with everyone from the Evans Family in attendance, including Sir Evans, whom Rebecca had managed to persuade to come. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Of course, Sir Evans appeared unwilling, mainly because he believed that people like Amelia and Eva were not worthy of his two outstanding grandsons. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, there was nothing he could do about the business of the conglomerate, and meddling in the marriages of the younger generation was even more out of his control, so he had to endure it. Next came Paul's parents. Eric didn't mind who Paul married, but Kate did, and she wore a sour expression throughout the wedding. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Paul noticed, he reminded Kate, "Mom, I invited the media to the wedding. If they capture you with an ugly face, don't blame the public for saying you're ugly." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kate's face finally softened, and she occasionally smiled at the camera, mainly to avoid people saying she looked ugly. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The wedding would sail at sea for several days, meaning that Paul's close friends and family would witness their love together. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before all the guests boarded the yacht, it remained docked by the shore. The media </span><span>was capturing moments of the bride and groom, while James sat in the car, not in a rush to board. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't that he was afraid of being photographed, but rather that he had spotted a few unexpected guests in the car...</span></p></div>
