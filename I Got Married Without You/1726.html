        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After hearing Amelia's words, her hands and feet turned icy cold, and even her blood seemed to chill. The light and hope that had just ignited were gone in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It was all fake..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The messenger who reported back, the one we waited for a month, the one we trusted for two months, turned out to be Ryan, who was actually a pawn in James' plan...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She curled her lips into a bitter smile, a sharp and suppressed laugh that struck Holden's eyes and made him feel guilty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mrs. Evans, it's all my fault. I'm sorry for him and I'm sorry for you too."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia sat on the couch for a long, long time, until she was shivering from the cold and finally regained consciousness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She hugged her arms tightly and slowly moved her numb eyes to look at Holden, who was still kneeling on the ground in repentance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Give me the address and I'll go find him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No matter if he was dead or alive, she had to see him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, Holden finally understood why James had warned him not to tell Amelia the truth - she would actually sacrifice herself for James.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Holden had always been reserved when it came to emotions, but in that moment, Amelia managed to touch him. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the place she wanted to go was not somewhere she could go, and he couldn't bear to let James' beloved person go to such a place...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sorry, I have no idea."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wasn't lying, he really didn't know the address because they were all drugged and taken in. Even when they woke up, all they saw were cold and heartless electronic devices, with no sign of any human presence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll go find it myself then."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Amelia firmly finished speaking, she steadied her trembling body and stood up, leaning on the sofa. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For her, as long as he was alive, she would go see him. If he died, she would go collect his body. They were always meant to be together.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mrs. Evans!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Holden quickly got up and stopped Amelia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Once you go in there, you can't come out."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia raised her tear-filled eyes and stared at Holden with intensity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How did you manage to get out?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Holden lowered his eyelashes, afraid to meet Amelia's gaze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Me and Mr. Shawn disguised ourselves as gamblers, pretending to be part of Erebus' group. They have no idea that we are actually working for S. So in the final round, as long as we </span><span>make the right choice, there's still a chance for us to get out."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But if they were discovered to be members of S, they would never be able to leave. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those who disguised themselves as gamblers to investigate the masterminds behind Erebus, ended up staying there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not only did the members sent to be undercover agents perish in Erebus, but also the leaked list of members was directly taken in by Erebus and turned into test subjects...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James agreed to help Master Davies expose the mastermind behind the scenes not only to break away from S and spend the rest of his life peacefully with Amelia, but also for the thousands of members who were tortured and killed by Erebus...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How can you expect to get out when even he can't?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Holden tried to persuade Amelia, but she just looked at him with a determined and desperate expression in her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was because of despair that she had no fear, but how could James bear to let his wife go to such a place and be tortured by those perverts?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He told me to make sure you live well, and if you're willing, he wouldn't mind if you remarried."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This made her both hurt and helpless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He's truly generous, he doesn't even mind if I remarry."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia pulled up the corners of her torn mouth, laughing bitterly, but tears couldn't help but fall from her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Holden remained silent, blocking her path and preventing her from leaving or causing any trouble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia knew that Holden wouldn't let her go, so she slowly retreated back to the couch and sat down again...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Can you tell me why you guys went there?"</span></p></div>
