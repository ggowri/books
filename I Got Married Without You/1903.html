        <h1>Chapter 1903 Matty's Fate</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Master Davies kept quiet about Holden's background until his death, all to protect him. This concealment of truth did touch Holden somewhat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In reality, even though Master Davies had kept his own background a secret, Holden didn't hold it against him. Master Davies had never hurt him, in fact, he had always treated him well. Even when Holden was a baby, it was Master Davies who personally took care of his feeding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When the news of Master Davies' death came from the headquarters of Organization S, Holden was having dinner at a seaside restaurant, holding his phone. He asked several times if Master Davies had said anything to Matty before he passed away, but the members all said no.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Holden lowered his gaze, tears unconsciously welling up in his eyes. He asked the others, "Did my father have his last supper before he died?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Members said that Master Davies had been relentlessly pursued by Matty recently, fighting day and night without a break. He hadn't eaten for several days straight. How could he possibly have found time to have dinner before his impending doom?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The member also mentioned that before Master Davies passed away, he had a message for Holden. He wanted Holden to take good care of Emelyn, saying that Emelyn had liked him since she was a child, and he must not let her down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Across the dining table, Emelyn, upon hearing these words, also covered her face and cried. She seemed to deeply regret not assisting her foster father in his final battle. Perhaps if they had been there, her foster father might not have died.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But how could such hatred be resolved? It seemed that only death could put an end to it. Otherwise, who would settle the karma left behind by the Davies family?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Holden? But Holden was innocent. For this innocent child, Master Davies would rather have borne the consequences alone than drag Holden into hell. This hatred, accumulated over three generations, could only end with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After hearing the news from Holden over the phone, James was left stunned. Outside the floor-to-ceiling windows, the warm winter sun streamed in, bathing him in its light. Despite the warmth it should have brought, he felt no warmth at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He remembered when he was a child, Master Davies bending over and asking a seven-year-old James, "Your father probably never let you ride on his shoulders, did he? Would you like to ride on mine and experience a bit of fatherly love?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that time, James, with his indifferent little face tilted upwards, was staring at Master Davies, not uttering a word for a long time. Just when Master Davies thought he didn't want to engage, James extended his frail hand, tugging at the corner of his clothes, "May I?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Master Davies stared at the small hands, covered in whip marks, a look of heartache in his eyes. Then, he raised his large hand and gently patted James on the head, "Of course, you can."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was the first time James sat high above, looking down at the world. It was also the first time he offered his heart full of gratitude, planning to spend his entire life fulfilling Master Davies' goals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hadn't he always treated Master Davies as a foster father? But as he grew up, as he peeled back the layers, he discovered one cruel truth after another. Yet James couldn't help but question, had Master Davies ever truly cared for him?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the other end of the phone, the equally silent Holden gave James an answer: "The members asked me to pass on a message from your father. He said the kindness he showed you was always genuine. However, it's also true that he used you. He feels very sorry about this and hopes that you can forgive him in the days to come."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man, who seldom showed emotion, suddenly found his eyes brimming with hot tears. Yet, he subtly lifted his well-defined chin, refusing to let his feelings show. "Where is he buried?" he asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Holden said, "Buried in Aronland."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was the home of Master Davies, Holden, and Emelyn, where nature had chosen for their father to return to his roots.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After getting the address, James took two days off and personally went to Aronland.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James fell silent for a long time as he stared at the photo of Master Davies on the tombstone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, he lifted his finger, placing it on the tombstone, caressing it just like Master Davies used to stroke his head when he was a child.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Master Davies, if it's possible, in my next life, I'd like to be your son."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't because James was kind, but Master Davies gave him the familial love that even his </span><span>own father never provided.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A gentle breeze rolled in, lightly brushing against the man's face. It felt like a reconciliation, as refreshing as a breath of spring air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before James left, he poured some wine in front of the tomb. It was Master Davies' favorite, a final farewell to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Master Davies had passed away, and Organization S had been completely disbanded. From then on, this organization would no longer exist in this world. All that remained were the members, returning to their normal lives.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Of course, if a member occasionally ran into trouble, they would reach out to each other for help. However, they no longer did so under the banner of Organization S, pursuing so-called acts of justice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Holden and Emelyn got married and started their own family in Aronland, near the place where Master Davies was buried. Whether it was on the anniversary of his death or just a regular day, they would visit Master Davies, sharing stories from their childhood with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matty, after dealing with Master Davies and waiting for Dylan to wake up, planned to go find Sophia. However, he was stopped by the people from The Lawrence Family. Regardless, he was a good man to his son and grandson. How could anyone bear to let him go to his death?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What the Lawrence Family meant was that they wanted Matty to stay with his family until the end of his life, or use the rest of his life to make amends to Amelia. After all, he had hurt his granddaughter. How could he just leave this world without doing anything?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matty didn't choose to die. He planned to make amends with Amelia before leaving. However, in the events that followed, Matty indeed managed to make things right.</span></p></div>
