        <h1>Chapter 1651 Soft and hard tactics</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kate lowered her eyelashes slowly upon hearing those words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What was she really worried about?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the past, she worried that Anthony, a person like him, was not worthy of Edith. She went to great lengths to break them up, only to discover that Anthony had his reasons.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, she worries that a woman like Eva is not worthy of Paul and wants to break them up too, but...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If one day, she suddenly realizes, like she did with Anthony, that Eva is not the person she thought she was, will she regret her actions today, just like she regretted breaking up Anthony?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As this thought arose, Kate broke out in a cold sweat. She hadn't even reached that point yet, so why was she having such thoughts? Could this be the lingering aftermath of past mistakes?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking about how Edith looked devastated after losing Anthony, and how she cut off all ties with her after learning the truth, Kate felt a chill run down her spine. Did she not lose a daughter already? Did she want to lose a son as well?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Kate lost in thought, James seized the opportunity to speak: "Kate, what if you let Paul marry Ms. Miller once? If Paul really is as you say, that he wants to marry Ms. Miller because he didn't get you, then they will eventually divorce. By then, you can find a suitable daughter-in-law for Paul, and he won't resent you. He will appreciate you as a mother who always looks out for him. But if you dampen his enthusiasm now, not only will you ruin his chance at marriage, but you will also damage your relationship with him. Why bother with such a thankless task?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After listening, Kate had an epiphany. Yes, Paul was different from Edith. He was the CEO of the Evans North America division. Even if it was a second marriage, there </span><span>were plenty of women who would be interested in him. Why should she worry?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the current situation, as Paul had said, was not about whether she agreed or not. It was about her apologizing to Eva. The thought of Eva potentially becoming her daughter-in-law made Kate even more unwilling to apologize.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kate couldn't afford to lose face, so she chose to remain silent. She thought that as long as she didn't respond, James wouldn't be able to see her thoughts. But she didn't expect James, after observing her for a while, to suddenly bring the conversation back to its original purpose.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In the caf&eacute;, you said Ms. Miller has no parents and looked down on her as an orphan. Did you forget that my wife also has no parents and is an orphan?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James knew where Kate had met Eva, what they talked about, and it made Kate extremely uneasy. "James, I was talking about Ms. Miller, not Amelia. Don't jump to conclusions."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>An impatient James coldly said, "Kate, Ms. Miller is my wife's sister. Don't make me repeat it a third time."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He meant that Ms. Miller was his wife's sister, and even if they had no blood relation, they were still connected. He couldn't help but identify with her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Understanding what James meant, Kate knew he wanted her to come up with a solution herself. She suggested, "How about this, I apologize to Amelia."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James sneered, "Those words were said to Ms. Miller, so naturally you should apologize to her first and obtain her forgiveness before seeing my wife."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In other words, if she didn't earn Ms. Miller's forgiveness, she had no right to see his wife. He was really arrogant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With James being so insistent, Kate suddenly realized that if it weren't for him speaking up for Amelia's sister, he probably wouldn't even bother looking at her, let alone argue with her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No wonder Sir Evans said that James had deep feelings for Amelia and that one day he would die by her hands. At first, Kate couldn't understand the true meaning of those words. Now, she realized that Sir Evans was right. Someone like James, who was devoted and sentimental, had such a vulnerable spot. How could he not be in danger?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, there were many people who wanted the life of the person in power of the Evans Family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But someone like James, who could use both soft and hard tactics in a conversation, who could dare to do anything, who could take his life?</span></p></div>
