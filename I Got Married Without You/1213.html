        <h1>Chapter 1213 Let me teach you a lesson, Brother</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Very wonderful?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James' face changed in just a few seconds, "My identity, don't tell anyone."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't want to be Jonny's cousin, disgusting!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia tilted her head and looked at the man who was resisting, teasing him intentionally, "Okay, brother, I'll keep it a secret."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James, who was driving, didn't react for a moment. He turned his head after turning a corner and asked, "What did you just call me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia leaned on the car window with one hand and said with a smirk, "Brother, what's wrong?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James was confused, "Why did you call me brother?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She smiled and said, "Before we did the appraisal, didn't you think I was your sister? So calling you brother isn't wrong..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James: ...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She looked very pleased with herself and leaned over, "Brother, your moral values are a bit lacking. How about I give you a lesson?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing the charming appearance of the little woman, he smiled, "You want to teach me? Okay, how do you want to do it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She took out her phone, searched for the Bible, and wanted to play it for him. Then she saw him drive the car into a small forest in the suburbs, "Where are we going?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man who was driving with one hand on the steering wheel turned his head and showed a smirk, "Find a quiet place to listen to your lesson."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia, who was usually tormented by him, immediately understood his implied meaning, "Don't be like this, can't I stop teaching you anymore..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James slowly curved his lips, a faint smile overflowing from his eyes, "You don't want to, but I do. Little sister, just obediently let me teach you..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia: ...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>he regretted teasing him earlier, and now she was suffering the consequences.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When James pushed her into the seat, she heard him whisper in her ear, "Little sister, why don't you call me big brother anymore?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia gritted her teeth, wanting to retaliate, but was silenced by his passionate kiss. Then, his body pressed against hers, and they made love in the car. What a stroke of bad luck...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jonny patiently waited for D</span><span>ominic</span><span> to kick A</span><span>melia</span><span> out of E</span><span>vans&rsquo;</span><span> house before going to kidnap her. However, he waited for two days straight and there was still no news.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was about to go crazy, "This D</span><span>ominic</span><span> is useless. If it were my father, he would have kicked that woman out of the house and assassinated her!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Herb, who had just come in from outside, heard his cousin's frantic voice and quickly took out his phone, "Brother, A</span><span>melia</span><span> messaged me and asked to meet up."</span></p></div>
