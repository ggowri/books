        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Babe, I really want you." Paul passionately and eagerly kissed Eva's red lips, his </span><span>restless hands wandering on her skin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I told you before, I'm pregnant, so we can't." Eva, almost suffocating from his kiss, felt her body wanting to respond but maintained her rationality.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I know we can't, but can you at least..." Before he could finish his sentence, Eva immediately pushed him away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you keep acting like this, we'll sleep in separate rooms." Paul instantly became obedient.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, please don't make me sleep in a separate room." Paul, controlled by her words, got off Eva and pulled her into his arms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Eva, after the child is born and your body has recovered, let me have a few nights with you." Eva, nestled in his embrace, looked up at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"After the child is born, the one-year agreement will be over. Whether I stay or not will depend on my mood." She tightened her hands around his, then loosened her grip.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul felt a little upset, turned to the side, and stared at the table lamp in a daze. Eva hesitated for a few seconds and then approached him from behind and hugged him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I promise you, is that not enough?" Her gentle expression meant that she would stay, but Paul didn't understand her implied meaning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's the use of your promise if you're still going to leave?" Eva thought he was being stubborn, so she didn't argue with him and instead pressed her cheek against his back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You have to go to work tomorrow, so go to sleep..." After holding it in for a while, Paul turned to the side and stared at her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Eva, I want to give you a grand wedding." Then, he would announce to the world at the wedding that he, Paul, had married her, and Eva would be his forever, unable to escape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After staring at Paul for a while, Eva nodded gently. "Okay, I'll do as you say."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There shouldn't be any obstacles between them anymore. </span><span>So</span><span> if he wanted a wedding, they would have a wedding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With his consent, Paul embraced Eva tightly again. "Babe, let's go to sleep."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Smelling his familiar scent, Eva closed her eyes and fell asleep peacefully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next morning, Eva went to the dressing room, took out her bag, and pulled out a voice recorder from it. She handed it to Paul. "Your mother probably doesn't know she was recorded. Destroy it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since they were married, it was better to not keep something that could easily cause distance and misunderstandings. Let Kate know nothing, especially since Elsie was already in prison.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul took the voice recorder and looked at Eva. "Wife, my mother always takes decisive actions. If you think she's not good, you don't have to meet her in the future."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva shook her head at his words. "I understand your mother. If I were born into a wealthy family, I wouldn't be happy if my child married someone who wasn't a suitable match. After all, who wants their child to suffer? Besides, she only said a few things to me, it's not a big deal."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For Eva, Kate mostly spoke the truth. She really wasn't born into a good family, had a low education, and worked at a nightclub. She wasn't a good match for Paul.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva knew it very well and didn't mind. In the future, she would treat Paul's mother as her own mother and live a good life together as a family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Eva not arguing with his mother, Paul felt that she was kind-hearted. "With you as my daughter-in-law, my mother is lucky to have you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva, who was drinking her tonic, glanced at him. "You'll be a parent too. Don't speak ill of your own mother."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul knew that Eva respected her elders, so he stopped. "Okay, I won't talk about her anymore. I'll go destroy the voice recorder."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By giving him the voice recorder to destroy, Eva was telling him that she wouldn't let his mother's actions affect her anymore since they were married.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed that even with the existence of the agreement, Eva was ready to live a good life with him. Once the wedding was held and the child was born, he would be able to keep Eva forever.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With this idea in mind, Paul happily took out the chip from the voice recorder, inserted it into the computer, and swiftly operated on the keyboard...</span></p></div>
