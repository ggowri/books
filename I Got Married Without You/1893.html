        <h1>Chapter 1893 An apple</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James didn't argue anymore and gestured for her to continue. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia then said, "I promised before that when Ryan stood up, I would give him a big gift..." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Afraid that James would misunderstand, Amelia added, "Johnny also saved my life, so I have to give him a gift, and Neil and George, who helped take care of Grace, also deserve one, so..." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before she could finish explaining, James interrupted her gently, "Babe, if you want to give gifts, go ahead. You don't need my permission." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing this, Amelia cupped James' handsome face and kissed him deeply, saying, "Babe, you're so good." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After praising him, Amelia continued, "I'll go pick out a few gifts now and have Frank send them over." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before she could get up, James said, "Tell me what you want to give, and I'll make the arrangements." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't want her to exert herself. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia felt sweet and content with such a good husband. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She smiled and told James what she wanted to give, and he went to make the arrangements. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After everything was arranged, James accompanied Amelia back to their room. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't want her to take a shower alone, so he helped her. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After they finished, he put a bathrobe on her and carried her to bed. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After doing all this, James went to the bathroom and doused himself with cold water, extinguishing his desires. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He tilted his chin up, facing the cold water, letting it pour over his head and face. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia was in his arms, and James swallowed hard several times, finally suppressing all his desires and closed his eyes to sleep. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next morning, Grace went to school, Frank went to deliver the gifts, and James and Amelia boarded the private jet again. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When they arrived in Barcelona, it was noon, the sky was blue, the sun was shining, and the temperature was just right. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James brought the gift for Johnny and handed it to him when they met. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even though you don't want it, I still have to thank you for saving my life." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Johnny glanced at Amelia and then at the gift box, showing a somewhat unwilling expression. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed like after receiving the gift, they would draw a clear line between them, but it was Amelia's intention, and it wouldn't be right not to accept it. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Johnny reluctantly accepted it, feeling happy inside because it was from Amelia. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I didn't expect you to come all the way here just to see Zenith." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Johnny put the gift in the passenger seat and turned to signal them to get in the car. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had been by Gigi's side and was already familiar with the routes in Barcelona. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't bring a driver since he heard they were coming and drove to the airport himself. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Peter had arranged the car, so James and Amelia got into Johnny's car. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They thought the atmosphere in the car would be tense, but as soon as they sat down, they ran into an old acquaintance, Herb. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He happened to come out of the airport and ran into their group, raising his arm and waving it in the air with a big smile on his face, basking in the sunlight. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James felt uncomfortable with his bright smile and quickly shifted his gaze to Johnny, saying, "Aren't you going to drive?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man trying to start the car tried a few times but failed, furrowing his brow, "I don't know how to drive this foreign car." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as he finished speaking, Herb opened the passenger door and sat on top of the gift box. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing the gift box being squashed by his butt, Johnny's heart skipped a beat, and then he exploded in anger, "Get up!" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Herb, who was still sitting on his butt, took out the gift box and, trembling, said, "I didn't mean to." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a cold expression, Johnny snatched the gift box from Herb's hand and carefully opened it. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he saw the metallic red apple inside, he couldn't help but turn his head and look at Amelia. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia smiled and nodded, as if to say, "Remember the time you saved my life with this gift." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Johnny didn't say anything, just glanced at her and pretended not to care, handing the apple to Herb. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I thought it was something valuable, but it's just a toy." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His actions and words were all a cover-up for his previous panic. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The people in the car, except for James, thought he was being disdainful. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Especially Herb, who held the red apple, looked at it from left to right, unable to see anything special about it, and simply threw it away... </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fortunately, he only threw it in the car. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Otherwise, Johnny would have kicked Herb out of the car by now. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Herb refused to get out of the car and turned back to look at James, "I heard from my dad that you're my Aunt Ashley's son. Is that true?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James, regretting getting into the car, flipped his eyes upward without saying a word, showing his impatience. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Herb didn't notice and continued excitedly, "It seems to be true. My dad didn't lie to me. But oh my god, you're actually my cousin. I can't believe it!" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No wonder when James slapped him earlier, he felt a sense of familiarity, as if the person slapping him was his relative. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't expect it to be true!</span></p></div>
