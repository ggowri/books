        <h1>Chapter 1793 Eva had been missing Amelia</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had a fever and was sweating, her seaweed-like hair was soaked, she looked as if she had just been pulled out of the sea. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Amelia in this state, Eva felt extremely sorry for her, she lifted the hair from her forehead and used a towel to wipe the sweat away. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It had been over two months since Amelia left a letter and disappeared overnight, breaking all her promises, and Eva was both angry and worried. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had been through these two months either lying in bed or crying. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva</span><span> </span><span>had even prepared for the worst, but still refused to believe it. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fortunately, Johnny came back and told her that Amelia was still alive, as was James, but they were in danger. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This allowed her to finally get a good night's sleep. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She knew Johnny's words were cautious, but for Eva, who had been waiting anxiously, it was enough. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, as long as Amelia was alive, everything was fine. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva was extremely gentle, repeatedly wiping Amelia's forehead, face, neck, and palms. She continued until Amelia's body temperature gradually </span><span>went down</span><span>, and only then did Eva breathe a sigh of relief. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia was still </span><span>having</span><span> </span><span>a nightmare, but this time,</span><span> she felt</span><span> a gentle hand lift her from the sea. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her tightly furrowed brow gradually relaxed, and under the cool touch, she slept for a while, and soon slowly opened her eyes again. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, she didn't see Johnny, but Eva's </span><span>pretty</span><span> face. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Amelia, are you awake?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva saw Amelia open her eyes and quickly put down the towel in her hand to check on her. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>How are you feeling now</span><span>?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After gently shaking her head, Amelia moistened her dry lips. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Eva, I'm sorry for making you worry." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing that,</span><span> Eva </span><span>fe</span><span>lt</span><span> </span><span>a lot less angry. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She raised her hand and deliberately pushed Amelia's shoulder. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're pregnant, but you went to such a dangerous place. You didn't consider your own safety, or our worries!" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing Eva scold her like an older sister, Amelia curved</span><span> her lips</span><span> into a gentle smile. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Eva, have you missed me?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva had intended to pretend to be angry, but upon hearing this, she couldn't help but cry. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I missed you much." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia also couldn't help but shed tears. "Eva, you are the best to me." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We grew up together, who could compare to our childhood bond? How could I not be the best to you?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia held back her tears and then burst into tears. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't cry, </span><span>you look ugly when you cry</span><span>." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You don't look good when you cry either." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After they finished speaking, they cried and laughed. Then Eva approached </span><span>her </span><span>and hugged Amelia. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In any case, you're back, and that's what matters." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a moment of silence, Amelia took a deep breath. "James divorced me." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Divorced?" Eva was incredulous when she heard this news. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She felt that even if Paul divorced her, James would not divorce Amelia. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, James's love for Amelia was incomparable, so how could he divorce her? </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the emotions in Amelia's eyes told her that they had indeed divorced. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What... what happened?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia turned over and lay on her side, placing her hands under her cheek. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Eva, should I not have gone to find James?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva, who knew nothing, was a little confused. "There's nothing you should or shouldn't do. How could you not go to find someone you love who has disappeared? " </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva was now with Paul, building a home together, and although it hadn&rsquo;t been long, she felt quite dependent on him. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought that if Paul were to disappear one day, she would also go to find him without hesitation. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was her beloved person and her husband, </span><span>so </span><span>how could she do nothing</span><span> when he was in danger</span><span>?</span></p></div>
