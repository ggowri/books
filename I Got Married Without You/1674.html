        <h1>Chapter 1674 Can't I kiss my own wife?</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul asked the butler to clear out the dressing room next to the master bedroom for Eva. He saw Eva standing in the living room looking uneasy. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking that she might be remembering how he had previously prevented her from staying here, he quickly rushed downstairs and walked up to her, grabbing her hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This will be your home from now on. You can manage it however you want," he said, looking down at Eva's belly. "It's getting late, you should rest."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Realizing that Paul was concerned about her, Eva nodded gently. However, she couldn't help but wonder if she would have to sleep in the same room as Paul after taking a shower.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With these anxious thoughts, Eva finished showering and blow-drying her hair, only to see Paul already sitting on the bed. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was wearing silk pajamas and had a notebook on his legs, tapping his long fingers on the keyboard. When he saw her coming out, Paul stopped typing and raised his long hand, lightly patting the bed next to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva walked over with a heavy heart and lifted the thin blanket, lying down at the edge of the bed. Feeling that their hasty marriage was a bit absurd and awkward, she quickly turned to her side and avoided looking at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul couldn't help but curl his lips when he saw her lying there. After watching Eva for a while, he closed his computer, turned off the light, and lay down. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To Eva's surprise, her waist suddenly sank as a big hand touched her. Then, her back was pressed against the man's firm chest, with only a layer of pajamas separating their warm bodies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What's worse, Paul's chin was against the back of her head, and his familiar breath slowly enveloped her from behind. Both of their hearts were pounding uncontrollably. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva didn't even know where to put her hand that was clutching the blanket.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing that she didn't push him away, Paul lowered his head and gently kissed the back of her neck. This startled Eva.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What are you trying to do?" she asked, lifting her hand to push Paul away. But in her excitement, her elbow accidentally bumped into his chin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ouch!" Paul winced in pain, covering his chin. He then looked at Eva with a furrowed brow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You know you're strong, but you don't know your own strength."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva's strength was well-known. She used to carry two buckets of water upstairs without any problem. But being told that she was strong by Paul felt a bit embarrassing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who told you to steal a kiss from me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Can't I kiss my own wife?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With those words, Paul abruptly silenced Eva by kissing her. Unable to say anything, she quickly turned her body again, facing the window, and ignored him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sensing her anger, Paul thought for a moment and then moved closer, hugging her from behind and burying his chin in the back of her neck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Although you're strong, it's not always a bad thing. From now on, you can help me with things I can't lift."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva rolled her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you can't say something nice, then don't say anything. Let's just go to sleep."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She pulled the blanket over her head and curled up into a ball. Paul, who didn't even have a corner of the blanket, couldn't help but laugh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I was just joking. I've never disliked your strength."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ignoring him, Eva closed her eyes and fell into a deep sleep, perhaps due to the exhaustion of pregnancy. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing her even breaths, Paul leaned forward slightly. Seeing that she was truly asleep, he lifted the blanket and placed his hand on her small belly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Having his child here felt so good.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His lips curved up involuntarily once again.</span></p></div>
