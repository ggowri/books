        <h1>Chapter 1707 Matty’s story</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia didn't feel too nervous as long as she didn't reveal her identity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My mother had another child."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matty, keeping his composure, asked when she admitted to being part of the Clark family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Where is she?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't know. We got separated when we were young, and I haven't found her yet."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He only found out that Sumasa wasn't part of the Clark family and had two children, one named Skender and one named Elvira. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Skender in front of her resembled someone from her memory, but not exactly like her mother Sumasa. She didn't know if Elvira looked like her either.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia, disguised with makeup, raised an eyebrow and scrutinized Matty. "Mr. Lawrence, why are you so interested in my sister's affairs?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matty, sipping his coffee, smirked gracefully. "I was just curious, that's all."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfazed by Amelia's impoliteness, Matty calmly responded to her question. "Those were pictures of my former lover when I was younger. We had a disagreement, and she cut herself out of them and ran away with our child."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia was shocked to learn that his ex-lover had also given birth to his child. "Did you find her later?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matty, as if narrating a story, replied calmly, "I found her after she passed away."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia was taken aback and quickly apologized. "I'm sorry, I didn't know..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matty waved it off. "It was a long time ago, it's fine."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia didn't want to ask any further, but Matty continued, "She gave birth to two children for me, and I brought them back and put them under my wife's name."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, Dylan's real grandmother was Matty's former lover.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia felt a bit sympathetic towards Matty's wife. "Your wife seems quite generous to accept your former lover's children."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her sarcastic remark didn't bother Matty. "My wife doesn't love me. Our relationship is merely a transaction."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed they both had their own motives.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia found their family situation quite complicated. "Do your children know they aren't your wife's biological children?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matty nodded briefly. "They know."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With those two simple words, Amelia understood why Dylan didn't acknowledge Matty's former lover as his grandmother. If he admitted it, it would become a joke.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was unfair for the children to bear such a background due to a business alliance. However, it wasn't Amelia's place to judge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matty then asked her, "If your mother was my child, what would you think?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia hesitated for a moment and replied, "If you couldn't marry your first love, then you shouldn't have let her have your child, and she shouldn't have had one."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matty's deep and powerful gaze locked onto Amelia. "You really dare to say anything."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under his intense stare, Amelia instinctively swallowed. "Mr. Lawrence, please forgive me. I was just speaking casually. Don't take it to heart."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had only considered the perspective of Matty's children and hadn't thought about her lack of authority to judge Matty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Compared to Sir Evans of the Evans Family, Matty was much more forgiving and didn't mind Amelia's impoliteness. "I heard your mother isn't part of the Clark family. So, which family does she belong to?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the topic returned to her, Amelia's eyes showed more doubt. "Mr. Lawrence, I don't know the answer to that question. I can't answer it."</span></p></div>
