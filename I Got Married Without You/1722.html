        <h1>Chapter 1722 Unreserved love</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia couldn't shake off the bitter smile on Holden's face as he left. It kept echoing in her mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She always felt like Holden was hiding something from her, but as for what it was...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She actually had a suspicion, but she automatically avoided the thought that James or Zack might have gotten into trouble. Holding onto her last hope, she endured all the uneasiness and stayed at home, obediently waiting for 22 days.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The hands on the watch pointed to 00:00 once again, but there was still no sign of James' car or his presence at the entrance of Blue Bay Island...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In this moment, all the trust that Amelia had built up crumbled. It was the first time she had smashed a million-dollar watch and also the first time she had flipped over a dining table.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She couldn't take it anymore. She stormed out of the villa like a madwoman, running all the way to the end of the road. If it wasn't for Peter stopping her, she would have been hit by a car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Peter pulled the irrational Amelia and pleaded with her, "Madam, please wait a little longer. Mr. Shawn will definitely come back, he will definitely come back!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia couldn't help but laugh, "Do you believe it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Peter was left speechless when he was asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He started off believing, but the moment Mr. Davies appeared, he no longer believed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It's possible that Mr. Davies returned safely, but it may have been at the cost of another life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Whose life was being exchanged, Peter didn't dare to think about it. One was the man who had raised him, and the other was the person he had relied on since childhood, Zack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though he had already guessed the outcome, he couldn't tell Amelia and had to pretend he knew nothing, silently accompanying her to prevent any trouble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If the deceased person is really Mr. Shawn, then Peter will stay by Amelia's side for the rest of his life, protecting her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Peter couldn't provide an answer, Amelia's fear grew bigger and bigger, until it completely consumed her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She gritted her teeth in fear, broke free from Peter's grasp, and hugged herself tightly, slowly crouching down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Peter, I'm starting to hate him..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He promised her that he would come back in a month, but he broke his promise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wrote to her again, promising to come back in two months, but he broke his promise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn&rsquo;t know if his promise of a lifetime commitment would also be broken.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he couldn&rsquo;t even keep his word on this, she would never forgive James.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Peter crouched on the ground, his body curled up into a ball, and his brow furrowed in concentration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ma'am, don't resent your husband. He loves you very, very much."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia's lips curled into a silent smile, but as she continued to smile, tears began to roll down her cheeks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll wait for him a little longer..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She waited for him a little longer, but if he still hadn't returned before dawn, she would go and find him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anyway, whether she lived or dead, she had to see James.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But before dawn, she didn't wait for James, instead she waited for Ryan...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia froze when she saw him slowly approaching with a cane, one step at a time, until he stood in front of her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ryan..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dressed in a white shirt, Ryan walked towards her with a determined stride, just like he did in his youth, facing the morning sun.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stood in front of her, silent, his gaze fixed on her dry and swollen eyes, lost in thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia slowly stood up and gazed down at the pair of legs standing in front of her...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you able to walk normally now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ryan cleared his mind and nodded at Amelia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But I still need to use a cane."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia felt relieved in her heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just stand up and that's all that matters."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She finished her sentence and looked up at Ryan, shifting her gaze away from his legs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How...how did you end up here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After hesitating for a long time, Ryan took out a white envelope and handed it to Amelia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she touched the envelope and saw James' handwriting, her heart sank once again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She steadied her trembling body and reached out to take the envelope. With shaking hands, she slowly opened it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was only one line of text above: </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Collins, I'm entrusting Amelia to you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After reading this short letter, Amelia's lips curled up in a mocking smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't come back, so he pushed her to someone else. Is that what it means to love her so much?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia tore the letter in half, her expression filled with a coldness she had never felt before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She tore up the letter that James had left behind in front of him, and the light in Ryan's eyes dimmed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ryan knew how much Amelia loved James, so when he received this letter, he immediately rushed to find her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I have no idea what happened to James, but he must have been desperate to entrust you to me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A possessive man with strong desires would never entrust his lover to another man, unless he was dead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Amelia..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I know," she said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia interrupted Ryan, forcing a smile and lifting the corners of her lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ryan, don't take what he says seriously. I... my life and death are in his hands."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ryan was shocked by these words. He couldn't help but wonder if she would have loved him the same way if he hadn't lost his memory back then.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, Amelia's love had always been unconditional.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James, please don't make the same mistake I did and lose such a great girl.</span></p></div>
