        <h1>Chapter 1803 Owen and Eugene persuaded Amelia</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eugene smiled faintly and turned to look at Owen, who was dressed in a suit and looked gloomy. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bro, did you hear that? My sister praised me for being good-looking."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Owen, who was usually not one to smile or speak much, responded with a calm expression, "You're here to discuss important matters, not to boast about yourself."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After giving Owen a look, Eugene turned to Amelia and said, "Amelia, Dylan said that you don't want to go back to the Lawrence family. Can you </span><span>tell me</span><span> </span><span>why?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia touched her </span><span>belly</span><span> </span><span>and replied, "I have my own child now and my own home. I don't want to go back to the Lawrence family. As long as I have you all, I'm happy."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eugene, with great gentleness, looked at Amelia's </span><span>belly</span><span> </span><span>and said, "Congratulations on your pregnancy. You're going to be a mother."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia, thinking about her child, smiled faintly and said, "Thank you for your blessings."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eugene, being perceptive, chatted with Amelia about the child for a while and used it as an opportunity to get closer to her. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He then advised her, "Amelia, no matter what, you need to go back home. This way, your child will know </span><span>where they belong</span><span>. </span><span>Having the backing of a family like the Lawrences isn't just a game-changer for when they're adults. It makes a huge difference even in their growing years, giving them a real shot at building guts and confidence.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Confidence and bravery were exactly what Amelia lacked </span><span>when she grew up</span><span>, which led to her being </span><span>manipulated</span><span> </span><span>in her adult life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia smiled at Eugene and the silent Owen and said, "I can provide a good environment for my child now, so I don't need the support of the Lawrence family."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Owen, rarely showing a smile, softened his approach towards Amelia and said, "But as your older brothers, we hope you will come back home."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking into Owen's sincere eyes, Amelia felt a bit conflicted. "I..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Owen continued, "Because of our elders, you and your mother have been away for so many years. We are sorry for that. Please give us a chance to make it up to you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eugene nodded in agreement, "My brother is right. Even if you don't live at the Lawrence family often in the future, you should bring your mother and sister's ashes back to the Lawrence family."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia firmly refused, "My mother's ashes can be moved from </span><span>t</span><span>he </span><span>Clark family to the Lawrence family, but my </span><span>sister's</span><span> cannot. She and her husband were very much in love and must be buried together."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The three brothers looked at each other and Dylan finally nodded, "Then we won't move your sister's ashes. We'll just include her name in the family tree and restore her identity."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia didn't say anything, and Eugene smiled at her, "Amelia, your mother will return to the Lawrence family, and your sister will regain her place in the Lawrence family. You are no exception."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Amelia could respond, Dylan added, "Now, you are the only living relative of our aunt. </span><span>So, you have to take her ashes yourself</span><span>. Come back with </span><span>us</span><span>."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Dylan spoke, Owen added, "Our grandfather truly didn't know that Sophia had sent your mother away, otherwise he wouldn't have let you both suffer outside for so long. If you are deeply upset about this, I will have him come and apologize to you personally. How about that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Faced with her three cousins, Amelia felt a headache coming on. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Give me some time to think about it. Also, I will need to wait until after I give birth to take any action regarding </span><span>taking my mom&rsquo;s ashes elsewhere</span><span>. My current situation makes it inconvenient for me to go to the gravesite."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Owen understood, "In that case, I'll leave our contact information with you. If you've made up your mind, give us a call."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia replied, "Okay," and the three brothers then bid farewell. However, as soon as they walked out the door, they bumped into Eva and Paul.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Eva saw Owen, her eyes lit up. When she saw Dylan, they lit up even more. And when she saw Eugene, her eyes widened in excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you... the lead actor from Lala Land?" Eugene, still maintaining his composure, put on a smile as he stepped outside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's right, it's me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah!" Eva screamed and, with excitement, rushed over to grab Eugene's arm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul</span><span> glared at Eugene</span><span>. Eva didn't notice</span><span> it</span><span> and continued to express her admiration for her idol.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I love watching your movies, you're such a great actor, I really </span><span>really</span><span> like you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Facing his fan, Eugene's smile grew even wider. "Am I only a good actor? Am I not handsome?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're handsome! There's no male actor in the world more handsome than you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eugene was very satisfied and took out a pen from his suit pocket, giving Eva a flirtatious look. "Do you want to exchange contact information?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Eva could respond, Paul stepped forward and, with his tall stature, stood between them. "Do you want me to give you my contact information?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Faced with Paul's anger, Eugene seemed much more composed. "If you want to, you can. </span><span>I also like hanging out with men</span><span>."</span></p></div>
