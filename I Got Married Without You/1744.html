        <h1>Chapter 1744 Get out of here</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They remained silent and waited for ten minutes before the wall next to the console suddenly separated from the left and right sides, and the external environment of Erebus suddenly appeared in front of them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia and Johnny saw the door open, took a step forward, and as they were about to step out of the room, two red lines aimed at their forehead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Players who have not chosen to leave, please return to your room, otherwise you will be shot immediately.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia's heart froze and quickly pulled Johnny back a step, the red line on her forehead disappearing in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;It seems that they are monitoring us.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Johnny swept in the direction of the red line and looked at the eye-catching wall in the distance like a snowy mountain. It was too far away to see where the surveillance was. All she knew was that they had already been fully monitored when they stepped </span><span>into this area.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Next, pay attention to what they say.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia nodded and the two of them were inside the infrared range, surveying the environment outside the room. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was a corridor outside, with rows of neat rooms on both sides. The interior of each room was the same, and the door number was engraved on the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their room was number 9, opposite them. The door over there was also number 9, and the man inside was looking at them in surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Why are you two people?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;We came together.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia responded briefly, while Johnny was disdainful. He glanced at the man and moved her gaze directly to room 10 opposite, where there was a middle-aged man in gorgeous attire, his hands in his pockets, looking at them from afar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn&rsquo;t know why, at first glance at this man, Johnny had a bad feeling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps it was because the man looked too scary, with several terrifying scars on his face, and his eagle like sharp eyes gave him an indescribable sense of ferocity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The key was that he still stared at Amelia, although he couldn't tell what the purpose was. Anyway, the look in his eyes was strange and eerie. Amelia was a bit scared when she saw it, and instinctively lowered her head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, in the moment she lowered her head, a tall and majestic body suddenly blocked in front of her, casting a thick silhouette under the white light. Amelia hid beneath this silhouette, avoiding the terrifying gaze of the middle-aged man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Players in each room were looking at each other's surroundings and the people in the room, as well as those who chose to give up. After seeing the door open, they followed the electronic sound prompt and quickly stepped out of the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before they came, most of them didn't know the rules. After receiving the Golden Leaf, they came out of curiosity to see what kind of casino Erebus was. Now, after listening to the rules and knowing that they would die, they didn't want to gamble their lives, so they chose to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Hello.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The middle-aged man in room 10 suddenly shouted at Johnny and Amelia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Why do you stay here, you don't look poor.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Johnny, who protected Amelia behind her, raised his eyes and looked coldly at the malicious man in room 10.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;So why are you staying here?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The middle-aged man leaned against the door and spoke calmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;I have cancer and I am incurable. Let's see if we can find a miracle here.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;I also have a terminal illness and want to play with exciting things before I die.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The topic seemed to open up like this, and Amelia and the room next door also began to hear voices.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;I lost all my wealth and came to get a huge bonus.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;I just love gambling, and whenever it's an exciting casino, I'll give it a try.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;I am wanted for murder, and if I go back, I will also die. It's better to choose an interesting way to die.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;I offended a boss, and if I go out, I will be pursued and killed.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, the people who came here were either wealthy individuals with terminal illnesses seeking stimulation, gamblers on the brink of death, or murderers. There were basically no normal people, except Amelia and Johnny.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the group chattered and discussed, the door of the room closed again, indicating that the person who had chosen to give up had left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The people sitting behind the scenes, seeing their chosen inviter choose to give up, threw away their signs one after another.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;It's really useless. I lost before I even started.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;I have advised you to invite more people, so that the odds are lower.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;But the chips are bigger, I don't want these bastards to win over my things.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;You have always been cautious in your actions.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When group 1 and group 2 were talking with each other in black, a female voice suddenly sounded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Where is Cobra from Group 2?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two groups of people immediately stopped joking and looked at the position of Group 2, 9th, empty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, Amelia's console suddenly popped up a note of paper.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The font above was printed, with a few words printed on it: 'Get out of here'.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia furrowed her brow slowly. Who asked her to leave?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Johnny saw the note and seemed to have guessed something. He quickly grabbed it and stuffed it into his pants pocket.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as he inserted it, a three-dimensional mechanical male voice suddenly sounded from the behind the scenes console.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Room 9's surveillance screen suddenly goes black. Who was operating in the dark</span></p></div>
