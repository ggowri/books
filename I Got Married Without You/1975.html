        <h1>Chapter 1975 Changed the Result</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the sheer curtain swayed, revealing the moonlit view outside the window, Amelia swallowed hard, unable to accept the situation, and loudly exclaimed, "No, this can't be happening.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"James, I heard from Johnny's bodyguard, Nick, that he loves using binoculars to spy us. Please don't do anything reckless here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James, who rarely expressed his thoughts openly, slightly raised his thick eyebrows and, with provocative eyes, glanced at the villa across before casually picking up the remote to turn off the lights.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry, they can't see us."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before she could finish speaking, James braced on the armrests, leaned in, and captured her lips. He stole the breath from her tongue and swallowed the words she had yet to speak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia initially resisted, but when James knelt on one knee, she trembled so much that she couldn't speak, clawing desperately at the back of the chair with her nails...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Previously, James mainly relied on his strength, but tonight, for some reason, he used tools. Amelia had never seen the tools before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She cried out for James, pleading with him not to use these things, but he wouldn't listen. Instead, he whispered seductively in her ear, "Honey, don't hold back. Let it out."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia was too embarrassed to make a sound. She bit her lip in silence. Seeing this, James increased the intensity with the help of tools and his strength. "Honey, I love hearing your moans..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If not for the soundproofing of the bedroom and the sheer curtains shielding the windows, Amelia, struggling to contain her moans, might have died of embarrassment...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Worse still, she couldn't move, at the mercy of James' "torments", and it wasn't just once. There were second and third times...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Exhausted, Amelia turned her head towards the firmly shut door, wishing for Alexander to knock and weakly say, "Mom, my stomach hurts. Can you take me to the hospital?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately, Alexander was trapped by a barrage of puzzles. He was currently sitting in the study, frowning deeply with his hands propping his little chin, staring at the screen, deep in thought...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he couldn't solve a problem, he would call Dylan for help. Under Dylan's guidance, Alexander managed to solve a few, but with so many questions in the question bank, he couldn't possibly ask for help with every single one.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had to teach himself, diving into whatever subject came up. He mastered each area thoroughly before tackling the questions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After effortlessly solving questions time after time, he discovered that this method was better than asking others. He dove headfirst into a sea of knowledge, studying tirelessly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once he felt well-prepared, he would challenge James, but each time, he was utterly outclassed, refreshing Alexander's respect for James with each defeat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gradually, the thoroughly crushed Alexander no longer underestimated James, but his unyielding spirit set a life goal for himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He aimed to surpass James in every possible way in the future. For this goal, young Alexander began to study diligently, even secretly learning computer skills from Paul...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, James, capitalizing on Alexander's competitive spirit, shifted his focus and spent his evenings openly relaxing with Amelia. At the same time, their genius son studied hard each night to try and surpass him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While one was blissfully happy, the other was miserably striving. Paul, suspecting the siblings were struggling, took the two kids in secret to a professional IQ testing institution.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After seeing the results, Paul doubted the institution's competence and took his children to another institution.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Paul got the same results at the other institution. His heart sank, but not ready to give up, he took his two underperforming kids to a prestigious institution in the Imperial Capital.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, he was smart, donning a baseball cap, sunglasses, and a face mask for complete anonymity. In the father's name section of the form, he wrote: [Cattle Evans].</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The receptionist, seeing this name and unaware that Paul had already submitted his registration form online under a different name, was puzzled by his choice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without commenting, the receptionist simply took the form and led Paul and his two children to the testing center. After going through the tests and receiving the same results as before, Paul lost all hope.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He removed his sunglasses and mask, looked at the professionals with keen eyes, and asked, "Can these test results be changed?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The highly intelligent professional, hearing this absurd question, made a face similar to Alexander's. "Mr. Paul Evans, how can you change an IQ test score?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul, pointing at the numbers and trying to bribe, said, "I'll give you 20 million dollars to change Margot's IQ from 120 to 130, and Maxwell's from 123 to 148, just let my son at least meet the Mensa qualifying score."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The professional, rubbing his bald head, responded, "Mr. Paul Evans, you seem to be using money to insult my intelligence..."</span></p></div>
