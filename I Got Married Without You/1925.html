        <h1>Chapter 1925 James prayed to the gods and Buddha</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James didn't say a word, just nodded slightly. For the current James, he was willing to do anything as long as it could wake Amelia up.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva was somewhat incredulous, but without hesitation, she directly gave James the address. The man with the address immediately rushed to the church.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was said that in the Dahaku Mountains, from the foot of the mountain all the way to the top of the church, every bow and every kowtow would grant one's wishes.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As a man who had never believed in Buddha before, he used to think it was nonsense. But now...</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James, dressed in a suit, put aside all his dignity and dropped all his arrogance. Step by step, he knelt and kowtowed.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knelt until his knees were in excruciating pain, and kowtowed until his forehead bled, but he never gave up.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't until he knelt to the top of the mountain, in front of the Buddha, that he collapsed onto the cushion.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a pale face, he clasped his hands together and closed his eyes slowly, surrounded by countless incense and under the gaze of the gods and Buddhas...</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He, James...</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>First wish, for Amelia to wake up.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Second wish, for the child to be healthy.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Third wish, for mother and child to live a long life.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nothing else, no other requests.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If the gods and Buddhas could grant his wishes, then he would be willing to donate all his wealth.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If the gods and Buddhas didn't care about wealth, then he would be willing to exchange his life for theirs.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With this wish, James knelt in front of every god and Buddha in the temple.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing his piety, a monk brought him a prayer ribbon and handed it to him, telling him to write the name of the person he wanted to save on it and hang it in the highest place on the tree, so that the gods and Buddhas could see it.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After expressing his gratitude, James took the prayer ribbon and wrote down his wishes.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, with legs sore and weak from kneeling, he climbed the ladder and hung the prayer ribbon in the highest place.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he was about to come down, he saw an older prayer ribbon with his own name written on it.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The wind was strong in the temple, and it only flashed before his eyes before the prayer ribbon was blown away...</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James descended the ladder and stood under the tree, searching through the surrounding prayer ribbons until he found the one with his name on it.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The tall and elegant man held the prayer ribbon with his slender fingers and looked at it from top to bottom...</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>First wish, for Eva's safety.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Second wish, for Ryan's health.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Third wish, for James' happiness.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing the beautiful handwriting and familiar name on the prayer ribbon, James didn't need to guess who wrote it.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at the small letters indicating the time at the end of the prayer ribbon, his eyes suddenly turned red for some reason.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It turned out that long ago, Amelia had prayed for him and kept it close to her heart. She must have wanted him to be happy, right?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James thought that if he had known earlier, he would never have let go and let her be with Ryan.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He would have cherished every minute and second with her. Unfortunately, everything was too late...</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under the wishing tree, the red prayer ribbons swayed in the wind. Under the tree stood a man with a flawless appearance and a beautiful figure.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He picked up the pen again and wrote below the third line on the prayer ribbon: "If you are safe, then I will be happy."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James didn't just pray once. As long as he took care of Amelia, he would continue to pray.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In every temple where his wishes were granted, there would be a figure dressed in a suit, holding a candle, and kneeling before the gods and Buddhas.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His forehead was repeatedly bruised, and his knees were strained from kneeling. Even the doctors advised him not to continue, as it would ruin his legs.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But James still refused to give up. He prayed to the gods and Buddhas everywhere, hoping they would take pity on him and let Amelia wake up sooner...</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Whether it was James who moved the heavens or the old doctor's miraculous skills, on the day of the first snowfall, the woman lying in the hospital bed moved her fingers slightly, then slowly opened her clear and somewhat confused eyes...</span></p></div>
