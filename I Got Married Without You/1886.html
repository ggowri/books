        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Eva took the gift from Amelia, she smiled at her. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's good that you're back safely, there's no need to buy any gifts." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A few days ago, when Amelia went to find her biological family, she was out of contact for several days, and Eva was extremely worried, unable to reach her on the phone. If it weren't for James returning and Paul comforting her, Eva would have gone to Erebus with her big belly to find Amelia. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fortunately, Paul had to go help James and couldn't hide it from her, so he told her the truth. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After hearing it, Eva's heart was in turmoil, and she anxiously waited for news from Amelia. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luckily, a few days later, James brought Amelia back. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Knowing that they were abroad and receiving treatment for a gunshot wound, Eva felt relieved and went ahead with the childbirth. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Paul didn't tell Eva about the chip in James' brain. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He planned to ask James about it after Eva was discharged from the hospital. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, such a big matter should be handled by the men. In the days to come, it was important to let the women live a happy and peaceful life. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul and James exchanged a glance, understanding each other without words, a silent agreement. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia, immersed in the joy of the children, took the gift box handed to her by James and placed it on the bedside table without opening it. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll look at it when we get back." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying that, Amelia couldn't wait and turned to look at Kate and Rebecca, holding the babies in her arms. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Can... can I hold them?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rebecca generously handed the baby in her arms to Amelia and showed her how to hold them. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia, eager to learn, held the small bundle of joy in her arms and her heart melted. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Newborn babies are so small..." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their eyes, nose, mouth, their whole body, everything was small and soft. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The more Amelia held the baby girl, the more she liked her, not wanting to let go, wishing her own child would be born soon. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As James watched Amelia standing in the sunlight, holding the baby and smiling, he saw the radiance of motherhood in her. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stared at her profile, and for a moment, he imagined Amelia holding and playing with their child. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't help but curl his lips, a hint of joy appearing on his face, faint but unable </span><span>to conceal his happiness. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After holding the baby for a while, Amelia walked up to James and, with a little effort, raised the baby higher for him to see. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Look, doesn't he resemble Paul with his eyebrows and eyes?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James lowered his gaze and glanced briefly at the baby before furrowing his brows. "He's all wrinkled, how can you tell?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With those words, the entire delivery room fell silent. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia awkwardly handed the baby girl back to Rebecca and went to pick up the baby boy from Kate's arms. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, she was tactful and didn't bring him in front of James, but he came over himself. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This one is even more wrinkled than the previous one." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"James!" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul couldn't help but clench his fists and stood up. "Do you find my child ugly?!" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James shifted his gaze away from the baby's face and looked at Paul, who was furious. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What do you think?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul lowered his gaze and glanced at the baby boy in Amelia's arms. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Indeed... he was a bit ugly. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But... "I asked the </span><span>doctor,</span><span> she said newborns are not good-looking!" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, you also find them ugly. No wonder you secretly asked the doctor!" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva couldn't believe what she was hearing and Paul quickly went back to comfort her. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't find them ugly, I just haven't seen babies this ugly before, so I..." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In fact, Eva also thought the babies were ugly, which was why she didn't even look at them. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now that Paul had said it out loud, her mental defense collapsed. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing Eva getting so angry that she was about to burst into tears, Paul panicked and tried to explain to her while glaring at James. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"James, this is all your fault!" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James, acting as if nothing had happened, raised his proud chin slightly and stared at Paul, who was seething with anger. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I never said your child was ugly." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The implication was that Paul had brought this upon himself and it had nothing to do with James. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"James, on such a good day, can't you say something nice?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at the frantic Paul, James helplessly raised his slender finger and gently touched the baby boy's forehead. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Actually, Ben isn't ugly, he just has a few more wrinkles than Barbie..." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"..." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After James finished speaking, he raised his clear, watery eyes and sincerely asked Paul, whose mouth was twitching uncontrollably, "Is that a nicer thing to say?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"..." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul ignored him and then turned to Amelia, who was holding the baby boy. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Amelia, why don't you take him back and rest for now?"</span></p></div>
