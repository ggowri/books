        <h1>Chapter 1199 James, you come to judge</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James completely ignored Gloria's harsh words, "Whether you can come out or not, everything is up to me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't argue back, but stared at Amelia with a sly and cold smile, "Even if you end up in a mental hospital or prison, you should still be able to kill someone, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James seemed to see through her thoughts, her cold and ruthless eyes fixed on Gloria, "If you dare to touch Amelia, I will make the entire Leinster family bury with you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if Gloria had no chance to harm Amelia, James's words still blocked her way out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her gloomy expression suddenly darkened, and no one could see how malicious the darkness hidden deep in her heart was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After warning Gloria, James had no intention of wasting time with her and got straight to the point, "I came to ask you two things. If your brother applies for parole and you tell me the truth, I won't submit any other evidence. But if you lie, I will add more charges and have him sentenced to death."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gloria</span><span>'s brother had tried to drown </span><span>James</span><span> in a swimming pool when </span><span>he</span><span> was five years old, and J</span><span>ames</span><span> naturally wouldn't let him go. Now, being able to use her brother's life to threaten G</span><span>loria</span><span> and force the truth out of her was a profitable deal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although G</span><span>loria</span><span> doesn't have any weaknesses, she still cares about her younger brother who has been serving her since childhood. So she agreed to this deal and asked, "What are the two things?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James asked coldly, "First, did you start the fire that killed my father?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing this, she quickly realized and replied, "It seems that you have found out who your biological mother is?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia was surprised and looked at Gloria and then at James.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No wonder Gloria treated him so badly. It turned out that she was not his biological mother.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was also no wonder that James came to the prison to see Gloria after talking to Dominic. It was all because of this...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia understood this, but since Gloria was not his biological mother, she wondered who his real mother was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James didn't want to talk about his biological mother and just asked coldly, "Answer me, yes or no?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gloria didn't answer him, but just smiled wickedly and asked, "Since you know the truth, tell me, was it right or wrong for your father to cheat on your mother after </span><span>marriage?"</span></p></div>
