        <h1>Chapter 1753 James might still alive</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The warm touch enveloped </span><span>Johnny</span><span>, his face turning slightly red, even the roots of his ears blushingly so. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The fluttering he felt for Amelia was always suppressed, but at the moment he kissed her, he seemed to be a little unable to hold back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His heart pounded, but he had to restrain the surging emotions as Amelia had a husband and a child. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He nervously squeezed his palms and looked at Amelia, who was frowning at him, "I didn't mean to."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia knew he didn't mean to, but still gave him a stern look, "Be more careful."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Johnny</span><span> grabbed the blanket, covering their heads. "What are you doing?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Struggling, Amelia pushed the blanket aside, and </span><span>Johnny</span><span> held her hand, "There's surveillance."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under the blanket, Amelia, looking at the hand grasping hers, asked, "What do you want to say?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Johnny</span><span> leaned in, whispering in her ear, "I think James might not be dead."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The voice was barely audible, even to surveillance, but Amelia heard it clearly. </span><span>Johnny</span><span> leaned closer, "That note, it should be from him, telling us to leave."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What </span><span>Johnny</span><span> thought, Amelia also considered. The only person she didn't want in danger was James. She just couldn't understand why, if he was alive, he wouldn't come home or at least call to let her know he was safe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia, unaware of his situation, slowly pushed aside the blanket, gazing at the ceiling, uncertain of the location of the surveillance, just staring blankly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you're watching me, James, give me a sign, let me know you're still alive, okay?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the mention of that vacant, distant gaze, Cobra in front of the screen lowered his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Next to him, Venom glanced at him and tapped with his fingers, "They're so intimate, they must be a couple, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cobra paused, not even bothering with Morse code, bluntly said, "Give them back the handcuff keys."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Venom shrugged, "Didn't I tell you? The game has started, and nobody has permission to enter the gaming area. What can I do?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Figure it out yourself." Leaving this remark, Cobra turned and briskly left the control room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as he stepped out, he encountered 2-7. She was leaning against the wall with her arms crossed, waiting for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You looked for Venom twice, thinking I didn't know?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cobra gave her a cold glance and walked past her, but 2-7 reached out and grabbed his arm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You should know, wherever you go, I can track you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cobra's icy gaze fixed on the hand gripping him, growing colder. "Let go."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead of letting go, 2-7 slid her hand upward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I heard what you said to Venom. Considering we're old acquaintances, I won't report you this time. But don't do it again."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As 2-7's small hand was about to slide into his chest, Cobra seized her wrist, then without mercy, flung it to the side.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without a glance, he picked up his pace and walked away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As 2-7 stood straight, rubbing her wrist, she snorted coldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't think flattering Venom will get you an audience with the founders."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cobra's steps gradually slowed, and 2-7 walked step by step in front of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Here, only I can see the three founders. If you want to see them, better listen to me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>2-7 raised her hand and lightly patted his head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've covered for you a few times. Don't make mistakes for unrelated people in the future, or I won't be lenient!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leaving this stern warning, 2-7 turned and left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cobra caught up, a palm striking the back of her neck. Just as she fell, Cobra drew his dagger, ready to strike, but his mind suddenly exploded in pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He dropped the dagger, clutching his head, curled up on the ground. In a matter of seconds, cold sweat soaked his entire body, even his program suit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the pain blurred his vision, a masked man strolled up to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I told you, touch her once, and I'll make you suffer."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man shook what he held in his hand, tilting his head with a smirk.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Next time, don't be so impulsive."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bending down, the man picked up the unconscious 2-7 and left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Venom, emerging from the control room, glanced at the departing 2-8, then looked down at the unconscious Cobra.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He walked over, crouched in front of Cobra, lifted his mask halfway, and checked his breathing. He was alive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a push, Cobra groaned, recovering from the pain, but he couldn't open his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing him awake, Venom sighed, complaining, "Such a hassle," then turned and walked away.</span></p></div>
