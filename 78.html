  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Captain Paul, please arrange our positions first,&rdquo; Sherry suddenly said as the two were about to fight.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Her calm words eased the tense atmosphere.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Paul snorted coldly and glared at Osborne fiercely. He said, &ldquo;As the captain of the bodyguard team, I will arrange your positions. Ms. Radcliffe&rsquo;s bodyguard team is divided into three types, including the peripheral security team, the inner bodyguard team, and the personal guards. Each type of treatment is different. Only those who are strong enough can become Ms. Radcliffe&rsquo;s inner bodyguards, or even personal guards.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">After saying that, Paul smiled jokingly at Osborne.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Sherry, Hunter, Oliver, and Brandon, the four of you are from a regular security company. You are very capable. You can join Ms. Radcliffe&rsquo;s inner bodyguard team. You will be responsible for Ms. Radcliffe&rsquo;s daily bodyguard work.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">After hearing this, the four people nodded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">They had known for a long time that they could not become Clarissa&rsquo;s personal bodyguards, nor could they serve as peripheral security guards. Inner bodyguards were the most suitable for them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">At this time, they all looked at Osborne. According to their judgment, Osborne had the strength to become Clarissa&rsquo;s personal bodyguard.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Paul teased, &ldquo;Osborne, you go to the peripheral security team. From now on, you will be responsible for the security and patrol work of the perimeter. To be precise, from now on you can just focus on guarding the gate.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">After he finished speaking, Sherry and the four others were stunned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Paul actually arranged Osborne to join the peripheral security team? That was such a waste of resources. It was retaliation. Osborne was definitely qualified to be Clarissa&rsquo;s personal guard. He could at least be an inner bodyguard.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The peripheral security team not only had the lowest pay but was also the most tiring and dangerous. The peripheral security team would be the first to face danger. They were the most likely group to be killed silently by the enemy. For example, in yesterday&rsquo;s attack, two entire guard teams were attacked without any warning. All of them were killed. Although their families would receive generous pensions, they were dead. Any capable professional bodyguard would not be willing to be a peripheral guard.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne&rsquo;s expression turned cold at this time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;What? Don&rsquo;t you like this position? Or don&rsquo;t you agree with my assignment?&rdquo; Paul ignored Osborne&rsquo;s cold eyes and said sarcastically, &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t accept it, you can get out. The Radcliffe family doesn&rsquo;t need a waste like you.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">After saying that, he looked at Osborne provocatively as if he was expecting Osborne to attack him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne walked towards Paul step by step with a cold face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Osborne, don&rsquo;t be impulsive.&rdquo; Hunter quickly grabbed Osborne. He whispered, &ldquo;Paul&rsquo;s strength is extraordinary. Otherwise, he wouldn&rsquo;t be able to become Ms. Radcliffe&rsquo;s bodyguard captain. He is deliberately provoking you. As long as you make a move, he&rsquo;ll have reason to fire you.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne frowned tightly when he heard this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He was very angry at this time. Paul was clearly retaliating against him. But he couldn&rsquo;t do anything.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">If he beat Paul, his successor test would be over. He could only endure Paul temporarily. Even if he was just a perimeter guard, he couldn&rsquo;t be fired.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;No problem. I can be the perimeter guard,&rdquo; Osborne coldly said. &ldquo;I just want to know, is this Ms. Radcliffe&rsquo;s or Ms. Donna Radcliffe&rsquo;s decision? Did you make the decision yourself?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Paul was disappointed when he saw that Osborne did not take any action.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He said coldly, &ldquo;Who do you think you are? Ms. Radcliffe and Ms. Donna Radcliffe will not involve in such a small matter.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne nodded. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go to work now.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">After saying that, Osborne changed into the uniform of a perimeter guard and put on the guard&rsquo;s equipment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">After saying goodbye to Sherry and the other three, he came to the main entrance of the Radcliffe Manor.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">There was a nine-person security team here.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The members of the team seemed to have received orders from Paul. Their attitudes were extremely cold.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">As soon as Osborne arrived, team leader, Thomas Edbercon, started giving orders to Osborne. &ldquo;You go stand guard first. For the next four hours, you stand still and don&rsquo;t make any movements. If you don&rsquo;t behave well, I will report it to Captain Paul. If you are fired then, don&rsquo;t blame me for not reminding you.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Thomas said this with a sneer. The other people around him couldn&rsquo;t help but laugh.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">They looked contemptuous.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;How dare a newcomer offend Captain Paul? He is simply courting death.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Captain Paul doesn&rsquo;t need to do anything himself to deal with him. He only needs to say a word. Someone will make him leave.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;He is such a fool!&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Compared to Captain Paul, he is shit!&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Several people talked contemptuously, without lowering their voices at all as if they were deliberately speaking for Osborne to hear.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne&rsquo;s expression turned cold in an instant.</p><div class="pagination">
