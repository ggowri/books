  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne immediately communicated with the Warfare Ancient Tree and quickly confirmed that Primordial wasn't lying to him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Warfare Ancient Tree can indeed help Osborne nurture the Sacred Artifact.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The more and stronger Sacred Power Osborne provides, the faster the Warfare Ancient Tree grows, and the more power it has to help him nurture the Sacred Artifact, enhancing its abilities and level.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Moreover, the Warfare Ancient Tree can fully nurture new Sacred Artifacts according to Osborne's requirements, making the Sacred Artifacts it creates more compatible with him and capable of unleashing greater power.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even, Osborne only needs to provide the Warfare Ancient Tree with an idea, and it can nurture the corresponding Sacred Artifact.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It's like giving the Warfare Ancient Tree a blueprint and parameters for a Sacred Artifact, and the Warfare Ancient Tree can create that Sacred Artifact.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Moreover, that Sacred Artifact will be fully compatible with Osborne, unleashing the greatest power.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"It's truly a great thing," Osborne sighed. At this moment, he no longer blamed Primordial for secretly making a bet with the Warfare Ancient Tree.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He even thought Primordial did the right thing.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In Osborne's view, the value of the Warfare Ancient Tree far surpasses that of the Ascending Sacred Sanctum. Unfortunately, Osborne has not yet reached Empyrean Sacredness. Although he has fused three types of power, making his Sacred Power much stronger than others at the same cultivation level, there is still a significant gap between him and a warrior truly at Empyrean Sacredness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If the Sacred Power he provides to the Warfare Ancient Tree isn't strong enough, the tree's growth will be too slow, and the nurturing and enhancement of the Sacred Artifact will also lag behind.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"When I advance my cultivation level in the future, everything will get better." Osborne knew he couldn't rush.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial said, "You can feed the Empyrean Sacredness-level skeleton you obtained on Umbra Earth to the Warfare Ancient Tree. It contains immense power and is excellent </span><span>material for crafting a Sacred Artifact. But since you don't know how to craft Sacred Artifacts and don't have the time to learn, you might as well feed it directly to the Warfare Ancient Tree. This will accelerate its growth and make the Sacred Artifact it nurtures even stronger."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing this, Osborne instantly became excited. "Really?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial smiled and said, "Of course. If you kill a warrior at Empyrean Sacredness in the future, you can also feed their corpse to the Warfare Ancient Tree. The Warfare Ancient Tree thrives on the corpses of the strong. The more powerful corpses you feed it, the faster it grows. It can even absorb the power attributes of the strong and imbue the Sacred Artifact with corresponding powers."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne became even more excited, thinking, "Now I know how to enhance the Warfare Ancient Tree. This is great. I can't defeat warriors at Empyrean Sacredness right now, but it will be different in the future."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>I want revenge. In the future, I will inevitably face many warriors at Empyrean Sacredness, even the top ones. By then, I will feed all their corpses to the Warfare Ancient Tree."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thinking of this, Osborne continued studying the Warfare Ancient Tree.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He took the Warfare Shield from the Warfare Ancient Tree and held it in his hand.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Immediately, he infused Sacred Power into it. Instantly, a layer of Warfare Mist enveloped him. He felt that he wasn't fully compatible with the Warfare Shield and couldn't unleash its full power.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, the Warfare Shield is the best among mid-grade Sacred Artifacts, almost reaching top-grade.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With Osborne's current strength, he couldn't fully activate or unleash the power of the Warfare Shield. This was perfectly normal.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But the defensive power of the Warfare Mist he unleashed was equally formidable.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Few below Empyrean Sacredness could break through this Warfare Mist.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even Osborne had to give his all to do so.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Great. With the Warfare Shield, I've finally made up for my weakness in defense. From now on, I don't have to worry about someone breaking through my defense and directly injuring my body." Osborne was very satisfied with the Warfare Shield.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After studying it for a while, he returned the Warfare Shield to the Warfare Ancient Tree, letting it continue nurturing it and striving to upgrade it to a top-grade Sacred Artifact as soon as possible.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At the same time, Osborne made some requests to the Warfare Ancient Tree. He hoped to modify the Warfare Shield to better suit him, even establishing a Bloodline Connection with it like the Bloodwrought Bow.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This was very simple for the Warfare Ancient Tree, requiring only some of Osborne's blood and Sacred Power.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, Osborne placed the Bloodwrought Bow on the Warfare Ancient Tree as well, letting it continue nurturing and enhancing the bow's power.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Regarding the Bloodwrought Bow, Osborne had only one request for the Warfare Ancient Tree: to enhance its attack power as much as possible. What he wanted was for the Bloodwrought Bow to possess ultimate offensive strength.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, Osborne took out the battle blade from the Warfare Ancient Tree, another Sacred Artifact.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The battle blade was a mid-grade Sacred Artifact with great power. However, Osborne felt it didn't suit him, and he wasn't very fond of weapons like battle blades.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After thinking for a moment, Osborne handed the battle blade to Agatha.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Agatha was stunned, staring blankly at Osborne, completely puzzled.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne smiled and said, "I want to give this battle blade to you. After all, we came here together. Now that I've gained so much, how could I not give you something? Besides, you can't easily use the power of the Dark Phoenix in the future, nor can you use the Phoenix Cry Bone Flute or the Phoenix Skeletal Shield anymore, to avoid being recognized. So, you happen to need a Sacred Artifact."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This battle blade is also a mid-grade Sacred Artifact. It may not suit you perfectly, but it shouldn't be much worse than your Phoenix Cry Bone Flute and Phoenix Skeletal Shield. With this battle blade, your strength won't drop much."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Osborne forcibly handed the battle blade to Agatha.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Holding the battle blade, Agatha looked completely dazed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She never expected Osborne to share a Sacred Artifact with her. This was a mid-grade Sacred Artifact, and it was grown on the Warfare Ancient Tree, making it stronger than ordinary mid-grade Sacred Artifacts.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her Phoenix Cry Bone Flute and Phoenix Skeletal Shield were just ordinary mid-grade Sacred Artifacts.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The value of a mid-grade Sacred Artifact was astonishingly high for anyone, and even blood brothers might not be willing to give it away.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, Osborne gave it to her without hesitation.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Agatha bit her lip, lowered her head to look at the battle blade, and felt the power within it. She couldn't help but sigh, thinking, "I owe Osborne even more now."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, she did not refuse. In the future, she would have to live under a different identity and could no longer use the Phoenix Cry Bone Flute and Phoenix Skeletal Shield. She truly needed a Sacred Artifact.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the end, Agatha softly said, "Thank you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne smiled and said, "If you have time in the future, you can give me this battle blade, and I'll place it on the Warfare Ancient Tree to let it continue nurturing and enhancing it for you. Also, give me some of your Sacred Power and blood. The Warfare Ancient Tree can adjust the blade to make it more compatible with you, unleashing greater power."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"By then, it might even suit you better than your Phoenix Cry Bone Flute and Phoenix Skeletal Shield."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Agatha gritted her teeth, then nodded. "Osborne, thank you. You've done so much for me. I originally wanted to help you and repay some of the kindness. But I realize I owe you even more now. I..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne waved his hand, interrupting Agatha, "Don't say things like that anymore. I'm helping you not because I want something in return. Besides, this is an investment. You're the Dark Phoenix, and you'll surely become a big figure in the Ember Phoenix Clan, a top warrior in the cosmos. Since I'm helping you now, you'll have to protect me in the future."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Agatha bit her lower lip and nodded firmly. "If that day comes, I will. Whatever it is, just tell me. As long as I can do it, I'll do my best to help you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne smiled and said, "That's good. Let's go. Let's keep exploring here together and see if there are any other treasures."</span></p><div class="pagination">
