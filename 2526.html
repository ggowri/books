  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Just as Osborne reached out to grab the Bewitching Lantern, a terrifying force suddenly erupted from it, blasting Osborne away instantly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At the same time, Osborne's mind was invaded by a strange force, instantly filled with countless illusionary spaces, leaving him standing still for a long time before recovering.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His once calm Soul Current Ocean was like a stormy sea, with massive cracks appearing everywhere.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's Soul Current Ocean was actually injured!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, even Primordial was shocked, instantly appearing on Osborne's shoulder with a very serious expression.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Osborne, what&rsquo;s going on?" Primordial asked, looking at Osborne in confusion.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne felt a bit scared at this moment. Just now, he had clearly encountered a Soul Attack. Fortunately, his Soul Current Ocean was strong enough to withstand it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But even so, his Soul Current Ocean was still injured. The barrier of his Soul Current Ocean cracked directly, causing his soul power to become very unstable.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If it were someone else, their Soul Current Ocean would have collapsed long ago, and they would have already died.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Fortunately, Osborne quickly used the power of the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity to repair his Soul Current Ocean.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then he said, "I was hit by an inexplicable Soul Attack and almost got into trouble. I didn't expect this Bewitching Lantern to be so powerful."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne was very puzzled.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Bewitching Lantern is a Legendary Sacred Artifact, so its power is naturally immense. However, Osborne had obtained the Bewitching Lantern before. At that time, he didn't feel it was so powerful.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, the Bewitching Lantern in front of him seemed off.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne stared at the Bewitching Lantern, and Primordial also looked at it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He had long merged with Osborne's Soul Current Ocean, so Osborne's Soul Current Ocean was his home. And just now, his home was almost shattered by a Soul Attack.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This made Primordial very upset.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With him in Osborne's Soul Current Ocean, it should be incredibly strong, at least capable of easily fending off a Soul Attack.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even a warrior skilled in Soul Attack at Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection would find it hard to harm Osborne's Soul Current Ocean.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But just now, Osborne's Soul Current Ocean was indeed injured.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial was very curious about what could harm Osborne's Soul Current Ocean.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When he saw it was just a Bewitching Lantern, Primordial became even more puzzled.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"A Soul Attack unleashed by a Legendary Sacred Artifact on its own could never harm your Soul Current Ocean. There's something wrong with this Bewitching Lantern," said Primordial.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His words matched Osborne's speculation. At this moment, Osborne activated Satan's Eye to its limit, carefully observing the Bewitching Lantern, missing no detail.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Suddenly, he exclaimed in surprise, "This Bewitching Lantern seems to be absorbing the power of the Phantomagic Realm. At this moment, it appears to have merged with the Phantomagic Realm."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing his words, Primordial was also very surprised. "Are you sure?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne nodded and said, "I'm sure. The Phantomagic Realm was formed from the corpse of the innate Beast Clan creature, the Hallucimagic Dragon. The Phantomagic Realm contains incredibly powerful Hallucinogenic Power and an extremely dense Demon Dragon's Breath.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I can see this Bewitching Lantern is frantically absorbing the Hallucinogenic Power and Demon Dragon's Breath from the Phantomagic Realm. Moreover, it's absorbing at an incredibly fast pace."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Osborne's expression turned somewhat grave because he knew that the demonic cultivator behind the Blossom Cage had a total of ninety-nine Bewitching Lanterns. Even if Osborne took one, that demonic cultivator still had ninety-eight left.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If all the Bewitching Lanterns are currently in some corner of the Phantomagic Realm, frantically absorbing its power, the Phantomagic Realm's power will soon be completely drained by these Bewitching Lanterns.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>By then, the Phantomagic Realm will disappear, and these Bewitching Lanterns will possess all of its power, becoming even stronger.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial was also shocked at this moment. "These Bewitching Lanterns can actually absorb the power of the Phantomagic Realm so quickly. However, if that's the case, the incredibly strong attack power of this Bewitching Lantern makes sense."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Looks like that demonic cultivator from Blossom Cage really came prepared this time. Although the Bewitching Lantern is just a Legendary Sacred Artifact, it can merge with the entire Phantomagic Realm and even absorb its power."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"That demonic cultivator's goal isn't just to devour the vital essence, soul power, and potential of all creatures in the Phantomagic Realm, but the entire Phantomagic Realm itself."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"He wants to merge the Phantomagic Realm into the Bewitching Lantern, refining it into an even more powerful Sacred Artifact. If he succeeds, the Bewitching Lantern might surpass a Sacred Artifact and become an Imperial Artifact."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Imperial Artifact?" Osborne was very surprised.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Each Bewitching Lantern is a Legendary Sacred Artifact. When ninety-nine Bewitching Lanterns are combined, their power surpasses that of an ordinary Supreme Sacred Artifact."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Stronger than a Supreme Sacred Artifact is an Imperial Artifact."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If these ninety-nine Bewitching Lanterns can truly merge the power of the entire Phantomagic Realm, they might really combine into an Imperial Artifact."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial sneered, "No wonder this Bewitching Lantern could harm your Soul Current Ocean. That Soul Attack just now was unleashed using the power of the Phantomagic Realm."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If that demonic cultivator successfully forges the Imperial Artifact, all of you are doomed. Even if you get Ms. Alba to take action herself, she probably won't be able to defeat that demonic cultivator."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"She might even be killed by that demonic cultivator using the Imperial Artifact. The power of an Imperial Artifact is beyond your imagination. The force unleashed by an Imperial Artifact can easily kill any warrior at the Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness level."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing Primordial's words, Osborne's expression turned extremely grave. "Is it really that powerful?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing Primordial nod, Osborne grew a bit anxious. After learning that there was a demonic cultivator behind Blossom Cage and understanding that demonic cultivator's plan, Osborne had already started preparing.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He planned to have Adriana confront that demonic cultivator personally, so he had Angela inform Adriana of the situation. Adriana agreed to come in person and then hide in the shadows.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As soon as that demonic cultivator appears, Adriana will take action immediately and kill him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne thought his plan was flawless.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, according to Osborne's understanding, that demonic cultivator was only at Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection and was doing all this just to reach Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Adriana was already a warrior at Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With Adriana's help, Osborne believed they could easily deal with that demonic cultivator.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But now, Osborne realized things weren't that simple.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "That demonic cultivator actually wants to use ninety-nine Bewitching Lanterns to devour the entire Phantomagic Realm's power and refine it into an Imperial Artifact.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If the Imperial Artifact is successfully refined, even Adriana might be killed by that demonic cultivator. In that case, bringing Adriana to help wouldn't solve anything and might even get her killed."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne felt a chill all over and thought, "No. I absolutely can't let that demonic cultivator's plan succeed. I absolutely can't harm Ms. Alba. Ms. Alba has saved me and helped me several times. I owe her too much. Even if I can't repay her kindness, how could I ever hurt her?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Immediately, Osborne fixed his gaze on that Bewitching Lantern.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He took a deep breath, then drew out the Warfare Scythe, his eyes filled with icy killing intent.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, Osborne walked toward the Bewitching Lantern, ready to destroy it completely with the Warfare Scythe.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But at that moment, Primordial stopped him and said, "Osborne, stop. You can't destroy this Bewitching Lantern."</span></p><div class="pagination">
