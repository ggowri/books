They were in dire straits, their bodies battered and bruised, their energy nearly spent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was only a matter of time before they fell in battle if no one intervened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne recognized the Aberrants all too well: Duke Medusa, Duke Titan, and Duke Tauren.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's go!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without a moment's hesitation, he charged into the fray, moving faster than Serena and the others could keep up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite their desperate situation, the eight members of the Draco Armed Services Branch held their ground, determination blazing in their eyes as they fought back against the onslaught.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their subordinates had already perished in the brutal assault.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Aberrants had launched a full-scale attack, catching the Draco Armed Services Branch completely off guard. The headquarters in the coastal provinces had been breached almost instantly, leaving them reeling from heavy losses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Class A and Class AA members had fallen in droves, and only these eight Class AAA warriors had managed to break free from the encirclement to escape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the Aberrants wasn't about to let them off the hook; they had been relentlessly pursued and finally cornered by twenty Class AAA clones.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The overwhelming numbers made it impossible for them to hold their ground, forcing them to send out a desperate plea for help.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But deep down, they knew reinforcements were unlikely to arrive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their Skyefall headquarters was under siege, and the other provincial headquarters were facing similar fates.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wesson was trapped by top-tier Class S fighters Rumen and Everett within the Augustine Estate, unable to break free.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In such dire circumstances, who could possibly come to their aid?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despair washed over the eight warriors, yet they continued to fight, determined to make the Aberrants pay dearly for their aggression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The shockwaves from the battle shattered the ground around them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One by one, they were thrown back, spitting blood as they crashed to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hahaha!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The twenty members of the Aberrants, including Duke Medusa, Duke Titan, and Duke Tauren, looked down at their battered foes with contempt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One of the Duke Medusa clones sneered, saying, "Submit now and become loyal hounds of the great King of the Aberrants, and we might spare your lives!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dream on!" The leader of the eight, a middle-aged man, glared defiantly at Duke Medusa. "We are members of the Draco Armed Services Branch! We'd rather die than betray Godfather. We won't become Gerardo's lapdogs!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You pathetic clones think you're so tough? Come on, kill us if you can! Godfather will avenge us and wipe you out!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Duke Medusa's fury ignited at those words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Godfather will avenge you? Ha! Pathetic! Your master has already been severely wounded by the great King of the Aberrants! He's barely hanging on, let alone coming to rescue you or seek vengeance!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Since you're so eager to die, I'll be happy to oblige! I'll chop off your heads and send them to the Augustine Estate so everyone can see just how miserably you've fallen!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill them now, then go after the others who managed to slip away!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a swift motion of her hand, the command was given, and the members of the Aberrants sprang into action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A wave of overwhelming attacks surged toward the eight warriors, who were already on the brink of collapse. Despair clouded their eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, despite the hopelessness of their situation, they didn't plead for mercy. Instead, they closed their eyes, quietly awaiting the end.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were orphans from the slums, and if not for Sebastian, they would have long since perished in the filth and chaos of their drug-infested neighborhood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian had given them a second chance at life, providing rigorous training and a stable, decent existence. They would rather die than betray him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The terrifying force of the attacks descended upon them, and the eight warriors braced for impact, convinced their time had come.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But after a moment, they realized they hadn't felt the searing pain of death. Confused, they slowly opened their eyes, only to be met with an astonishing sight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Standing before them was a tall, imposing figure radiating a faint crimson martial arts aura that absorbed and deflected every incoming strike.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The eight warriors stared, stunned into silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The silhouette was strikingly reminiscent of Sebastian in his younger days.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Godfather!" they gasped in unison, disbelief and hope flooding their hearts.</span></p><div class="pagination">
