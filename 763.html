  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne nodded, not bothering to shower or dress. He quickly settled into a meditative posture and began his cultivation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This time, he felt his mind become incredibly clear again, with thoughts racing more freely than ever. Every problem related to his training seemed to solve itself effortlessly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This heightened sense of clarity was almost intoxicating.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne poured all his energy into developing the Light Realm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He felt as though a clear path had been laid out for him, and he just needed to follow it to master this realm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In a matter of minutes, Osborne's body started to glow brightly, and the room was enveloped in a radiant light. It felt like they were in a dreamscape filled with beams of light.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Emma watched in awe.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She felt as if she were enveloped in a cage of light, with the only sensation being the power of the light elemental around her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Is this the power of a realm?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne's Light Realm seems even stronger and more stable than that of Clay, with more intricate variations!" Emma thought to herself, amazed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The power of a realm was the key to distinguishing between an average Class AAA and a top-tier Class AAA.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">To make it onto the Godson rankings, one must not only reach Class AAA but also master a realm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">While thousands of young experts around the world might reach the level, only a few hundred manage to master a realm's power.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Emma, who had been striving for realm mastery without success, felt a pang of envy seeing Osborne effortlessly achieve it before her eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Noticing that Osborne was still deeply engrossed in his training, she closed her eyes and began her own practice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At that moment, she suddenly felt her own insight dramatically increase.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Emma shuddered with realization.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"So I do have a special constitution! Not only does it help Osborne enhance his insight, but it can also boost my own!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With this newfound understanding, she wasted no time and threw herself into her cultivation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Meanwhile, Osborne was working on developing the Thunder realm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The breakthrough with the Light Realm was expected, not just because of Emma's special constitution that boosted his insight but also due to his strong foundation in light elements.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mastering the Light Realm came naturally to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, developing the Thunder Realm was proving to be more challenging.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Despite the significant boost in his insight, mastering the Thunder Realm still required overcoming many obstacles.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Yet, Osborne could clearly feel his control over lightning growing stronger by the minute.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Two hours had flown by quickly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne's mind, which had been incredibly sharp, suddenly felt sluggish. The sharp contrast made him pull out of his meditation immediately.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He shook his head, trying to suppress the discomfort.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It looks like this boost in insight only lasts about two hours. But once it fades, it seems like the improvement might stick around!" he mused.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"The dullness I'm feeling isn't a true loss of clarity, just a result of the sudden drop. If this happens a few more times, my insight could increase significantly and permanently!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His eyes lit up with excitement.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Meanwhile, Emma also opened her eyes, her gaze reflecting the same exhilaration.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The enhanced insight was intoxicating, and she felt that with a few more experiences like this, mastering a realm would be within her reach.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She looked at Osborne with a playful glint.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Osborne, how about one more time?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne, now used to Emma's directness, checked the time and decided to go along with it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He wanted to understand what was causing these effects.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As they proceeded, Osborne focused on sensing any unusual sensations.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He soon felt a peculiar energy activate within Emma's body, which flowed into him through their contact.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This energy seemed to sharpen his mind even further.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He realized that this strange energy was improving his cognitive functions by enhancing the neurons in his brain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne was surprised.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"So, it's this unique energy that's boosting my insight?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He delved deeper into his senses and pinpointed the source of this energy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was Emma's right eye, Death's Stare!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Stunned, Osborne wondered, "How could Emma's Death's Stare contain such an energy that enhances my cognitive abilities?"</p><div class="pagination">
