  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In one breath, Osborne was using </span><span>Thunderform</span><span> Flash, darting around the cramped confines of the Malevolence Airship, narrowly avoiding Calvin and his henchmen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the next moment, he suddenly stopped and launched his counterattack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His arms crackled with electricity as he drove a fist toward Calvin's chest. To ensure he didn't kill Calvin outright or reveal too much of his own power, Osborne went easy, channeling only ten percent of his strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He believed that would be more than enough.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, even with just his lightning abilities, he could easily take down a low-level Deity Overlord warrior. Calvin, at his peak in the Celestial Deity realm, simply couldn't compare.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But for Calvin, seeing Osborne finally rise to the challenge seemed like a reason to celebrate. He didn't sense the impending danger; instead, he chuckled triumphantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, Osborne, </span><span>you</span><span> useless coward finally decide to fight back? Ha! Let's see how I teach you a lesson and show you..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Calvin could finish his taunt, their attacks collided.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvin expected his overwhelming advantage&mdash;being three minor tiers above Osborne&mdash;to smash through Osborne's assault, leaving him vulnerable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the reality shattered his confidence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvin's strength crumbled under Osborne's attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The electrical force tore through his defenses with ease, shattering Calvin's divine power barrier and slamming a fist hard against his chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvin never saw it coming.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was no time to react as Osborne's punch landed squarely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, he felt something inside him break.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was his divine power essence!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The impact sent Calvin flying backward, crashing into the Malevolence Airship's divine power barrier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Waves of energy rippled violently across the shield as he crumpled to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blood poured from the corner of his mouth, and his eyes widened in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You... you..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvin struggled to raise a trembling hand, pointing weakly at Osborne, but no words could escape his lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His face had drained of color, and despair flooded in as he realized the gravity of his situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had shattered his divine power essence, and with it, his very identity and power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ugh!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd erupted in a cacophony of shocked gasps and murmurs. They witnessed Osborne's devastating attack, the way he had flung Calvin away and broken his essence in one swift motion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unbelievable expressions masked their faces as they fixed their eyes on Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Calvin's own subordinates stared in wide-eyed fear, grappling with the reality of what had just occurred.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvin, a peak Celestial Deity, lay defeated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On this Malevolence Airship, there were over 10 thousand souls, but apart from Athena, the leader of ten thousand, none matched Calvin's power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although many in the crowd had looked down on him for being part of the Human Community, they had to admit he was stronger than they had been.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, here was Osborne vanquishing him in one blow!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They couldn't wrap their heads around it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Isn't he only supposed to have broken through the Celestial Deity realm recently? Isn't he just fast?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shock settled over the onlookers; respect and trepidation flickered in their gazes as they regarded Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You... you shattered my divine power essence?" Calvin finally managed to speak, his voice a hollow echo of despair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His heart sank as panic coursed through him. Without his divine power essence, he was rendered powerless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the world of </span><span>Celestara</span><span>, losing one's divine power essence meant there was little hope for recovery&mdash;if any at all. Even if a remedy existed, it was beyond Calvin's reach.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, he felt the crushing weight of despair settle in his chest, as if the very air had been sucked from his lungs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thought struck Calvin like a lightning bolt&mdash;if he became useless, he would lose everything like the title of head of the Swift family. There's no way they'd let a cripple hold that position!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Wild Flame Army's chiliarch?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A nobody like him had no right to that title.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And what about his wife, Nydia, Laird's illegitimate daughter? She'd jump at the chance to leave him, cutting all ties without a second thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And Athena?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How could he continue to satisfy Athena in this condition? Would she even bother to help a broken man like him?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, despair gripped Calvin like a vice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He glared hatefully at Osborne, his eyes burning with rage, wishing he could devour Osborne whole. But the rapid decline of his divine power and his weakening body reminded him of the grim reality. He could never hope to take Osborne on again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's cold gaze met </span><span>Calvin's,</span><span> his voice devoid of sympathy. "I warned you, but you didn't want to hear it. I didn't expect a peak Celestial Deity to be such a waste, unable to withstand a single punch, leaving your divine power essence in ruins.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Looks like you brought this on yourself!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvin's face flushed with fury; the anger coursing through him made his body tremble, and he couldn't hold back another spout of blood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why! I hate this!" he bellowed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, a cold, commanding voice cut through the tension like a knife.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's going on?!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's happening here? Who dares to cause a scene on my Malevolence Airship?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We're racing toward Divine Peak Nine at full speed, and you think you can start a fight here? If you damage this ship, you'll face consequences you can't handle!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Athena materialized not far from them, her presence radiating authority.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her icy gaze landed on Osborne, filled with an unmistakable intent to kill.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is it you?"</span></p><div class="pagination">
