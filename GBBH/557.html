  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After playing for a while, Ashley grew drowsy and fell asleep again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander scooped up Rosalia and carried her into the adjacent room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Did you miss me?" he asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, of course, I missed you, Master," Rosalia replied softly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come, let me give you a massage," Alexander said with a grin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosalia blushed as she began to undress, revealing her alluring figure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wow, they're so big," Alexander exclaimed, his eyes fixed on her ample bosom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So soft. I remember they weren't this big before. Have you been using the cream I invented every day?" he asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, every day." Rosalia nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then she began to caress her own breasts, gently kneading them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander gasped, "You're getting more and more seductive. Does it feel good to touch yourself?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosalia's face turned even redder, but she continued to knead her breasts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander admired her, thinking she was as ripe as a juicy peach.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosalia stared at the bulge in Alexander's pants, licking her lips greedily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She quickly lay down, eagerly awaiting him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander took out the cream and began to apply it to Rosalia's body, gradually moving downwards.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He massaged her neck, shoulders, and then her breasts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosalia let out a long sigh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She said, "That feels so good. Master, where did you learn this massage technique? I've been to many spas, but none have a technique like yours."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander chuckled, "It's not just the technique that's different; I have a special ability."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No wonder you have so many beautiful women around you, and they can't leave you," Rosalia panted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's massage was too stimulating for her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He pressed his palms against her firm breasts, the cream making her skin incredibly smooth and slippery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sensation was exquisite, making her nerves tingle with excitement. Her breasts began to swell, and her nipples hardened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's desire surged.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosalia couldn't suppress her moans, which echoed throughout the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, Alexander moved deeper.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The cream's slipperiness, combined with the glistening moisture, allowed his fingers to slide effortlessly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This stimulation was too much for any woman to bear. Rosalia lay on the bed, completely at Alexander's mercy. The bedsheet was almost soaked through.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After an unknown amount of time, Rosalia suddenly cried out, her body arching upwards.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander felt his palm filled with sticky moisture.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Women are truly made of water," he marveled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you like it, Master?" Rosalia asked seductively.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's see how your skin looks now," Alexander suggested.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosalia lightly touched her skin, hardly believing how smooth it was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander had only massaged her once, yet the effect was incredible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Master, you're truly amazing," Rosalia praised, giving him a thumb-up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Master, please massage my chest again. I think your massage is better than mine, and the effect lasts longer," she added.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander teased her, "You're really taking advantage of me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosalia grabbed Alexander's hand. "Master, please massage me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander kneaded her ample breasts, changing their shape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sensation of her firm breasts was incredibly satisfying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosalia felt as if she had been electrocuted. She felt a swelling in her chest, as if it came from deep within her soul.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She muttered, "Master, I want you to massage me to enhance and lift, but I don't want them to get any bigger. Will they get bigger?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh no, they're going to get bigger. I'm already a D cup, and they're so heavy."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander chuckled, "It's good if they get bigger. More men will look at you. What do you think about that?"</span></p><div class="pagination">
