  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every gunner in the convoy opened fire all at once.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their first barrage of concentrated firepower brought down over a dozen of those mutant beasts, with just as many taking heavy hits.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But these weren't your average animals&mdash;there were tons of them, and damn if they hadn't gotten smart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment they realized they were facing more enemies and bigger threats, they scattered like pros, dodging bullets left and right.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once they spread out, the beasts moved like they were following some battle plan, forming this massive net that started closing in around the convoy from all sides.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shit," Norah hissed under her breath. These mutants might not have had anyone calling the shots, but they sure as hell weren't stupid.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had to bail now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Knowing they'd stepped in it big </span><span>time,</span><span> Norah grabbed her radio and barked the order to retreat. The convoy pulled a hard one-eighty and gunned it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They kept up heavy fire as they hauled ass out of there. This wasn't the time to worry about conserving ammo. They had to save their lives.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lucky for them, they were loaded for bear, with plenty of ammo, enough food, and water to go around, and every vehicle was carrying a drum of gas.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The convoy had exactly one advantage over these mutant bastards&mdash;pure horsepower. With their oversized tires and engines pushing several hundred horses, those vehicles could really move when they had to.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They could maintain their speed as long as they had gas in the tank.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Norah's quick thinking saved their butts. She managed to get their convoy out just before the mutant beasts could completely box them in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But even after breaking free, they couldn't exactly lead this massive pack of mutant creatures straight to the port.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead, Norah gunned it toward Rockwood Town, which wasn't too far off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their only shot at survival was to make it to Rockwood Town and use the buildings for cover.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When they rolled into town, there wasn't a soul in sight&mdash;just corpses scattered around.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luckily, they spotted a sturdy old church with a courtyard surrounded by towering stone walls over 10 feet high. The whole setup looked like a mini fortress.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Norah couldn't believe their luck. She quickly got the convoy parked around the church and had everyone hustle their weapons, ammo, food, and water inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The church's main door was a beast, with thick wood reinforced with metal plating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Norah wasn't taking any chances. After they locked up, she had her people pile every stone table, chair, and slab they could find against the door as an extra barrier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The team got creative with their defense setup, dragging the church furniture over to the walls. By standing on these makeshift platforms, they'd have clear shots at any monsters trying to get in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They barely had time to finish before thousands of mutant beasts surrounded the church, leaving no way out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A bone-chilling roar echoed through the air as the mutant ape led its pack of several dozen mutated beasts in their first wave of attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The heavy firepower made quick work of them, though. More than a dozen corpses littered the ground before the rest retreated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Norah had taken out their leader first, landing a perfect headshot with her sniper rifle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone felt the tension ease a bit when they saw how that rattled the remaining creatures.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But their relief didn't last long. The beasts launched several more attacks, though each one was beaten back. Eventually, they changed tactics and just surrounded the church.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Things got even hairier when hundreds more mutants joined the siege. Instead of their numbers dwindling, the horde had grown to over two thousand strong.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Weirdly enough, that was when the suicide squad actually started to calm down. They figured they were dead either way if they couldn't break through.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was a fight to the death between humans and monsters. It was not like these monsters were going to take prisoners. Their only shot at survival was to give it </span><span>everything they had.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Norah split the team into two groups so they could take turns resting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even she had to take a break, setting down her rifle to grab some food and water. Using her powers non-stop was taking a serious toll on her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Being only a level-two metahuman meant she had limits. Sure, her firearms powers were impressive, but at this rate, her powers would burn out before they had time to fully recharge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Listen up, everyone! The strike team definitely knows we're in trouble. They'll head back for reinforcements. We just need to hold out long enough for them to get here. Help is coming!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Norah's voice rang out with forced confidence as she tried to rally her team.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Deep down, she knew their chances were slim. The port just didn't have the firepower to rescue them from so many monsters. But she couldn't let that show.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If the team lost hope now, if their morale crashed, they'd be dead before help could even try to reach them.</span></p><div class="pagination">
