His usual fierce expression, along with his piercing eyes, had softened, revealing an unexpected trace of serenity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lincoln stroked the top of Donald's head and chanted a sacred blessing, "Om, Amonga, Vairochana, Mahamudra..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The words echoed in Donald's ears, resonating deep within him. A wave of coolness washed over him, spreading from the top of his head through his entire body. He had never felt so at peace. Then, as if something had clicked into place in his mind, clarity settled over him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a long pause, Lincoln withdrew his hand. "Good. Donald, you have found insight. But the weight of your past actions remains. The magistrate's advisor, Mr. Sutton, has been waiting for you in the guest hall. Are you willing to go to Darwin Court?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, I'm willing to go." With a solemn expression, Donald bowed to Lincoln. Then, he strode out for the guest hall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, his voice rang out from the corridor, laughing as he sang, "A heart kept pure will see the way, like a polished mirror, shining bright. Desires cast off, the past laid bare. The path unfolds, serene and light. Blessed be, blessed be, Holy Father!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After leaving Emerald Manor, Ben arrived at the Hall of Saints in Dominion Church. The grand hall, spanning dozens of feet in both directions, housed 18 golden statues of revered saints, each sculpted with lifelike detail.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Some had long, flowing brows. Some had arms reaching past their knees. Some stood tall and imposing. Some smiled gently, holding a flower between their fingers. One rode a tiger, and another sat atop a deer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seated before the statues were 18 priests, all clad in crimson robes, deep in their meditative practice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ben stepped forward and greeted them respectfully. "I pay my respects to the Fathers."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The priest at the far end, a middle-aged man who was fanning himself leisurely, spoke in a calm tone, "In three months, it will be time for the once-in-five-years selection of lay disciples. Ordinarily, the Head Priest would oversee it, but he remains away on important matters. We must take charge in his stead. You must prepare thoroughly."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, Father Declan. Rest assured, I will do my utmost." Ben bowed, then set off to make arrangements for the upcoming selection.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ben arrived at the outer courtyard and carefully wrote down all the requirements, selection criteria, and schedule for Dominion Church's recruitment of lay disciples. He instructed the overseers to post the announcements throughout the church and had messengers deliver copies to the Hrodvik government for nationwide proclamation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That night, the stone house of Timothy in Emerald Manor was brightly lit. Logan exclaimed, "Alex, this place is amazing!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Logan sprawled across a massive bed covered in luxurious silk quilts and rolled around.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander ignored Logan, for he was too busy rummaging through a large oak chest beside the bed. Inside, he found a pile of coins, probably a few hundred dollars, along with two banknotes from the Hrodvik Treasury, each worth a thousand coins. There was also a thumb-sized bottle labeled Mending Powder, with half of its contents remaining. Just the name alone suggested it was valuable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's eyes gleamed as he grabbed the banknotes and flipped them over. He thought, "Finally, some money."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The chest also contained several sets of spare clothes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmm? What's this?" Alexander thought. At the very bottom, he discovered a small iron box. Opening it, he found a thin, slightly yellowed scripture. The cover bore bold, chiseled calligraphy: St. Paul's Muscle-Tendon Classic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's heart skipped a beat. He carefully turned to the first page and read, "After the passing of St. Paul, he was laid to rest near Mount Haldrith. Yet, tales soon spread of sightings elsewhere. Curious, his followers opened the tomb, only to find his remains missing. Left behind were a single shoe and a sealed iron box. Inside lay two scriptures, the Muscle-Tendon Classic and the Marrow-Cleansing Classic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Only a level-one warrior with an untouched body may train in the Muscle-Tendon Classic. Once mastered, the Marrow-Cleansing Classic follows, refining the very essence of bone and blood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"At this stage, the body becomes as solid as steel, muscles full and firm. The marrow turns as white as frost, the blood as dense as mercury. This marks the level-four warrior. When the two classics are combined, the practitioner ascends to level-five, achieving the pinnacle of power."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I hit the jackpot!" Alexander leaped to his feet, laughing wildly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?" Logan hurried over and took a look. "Muscle-Tendon Classic? You mean the one from the tales? Doesn't seem that impressive..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander flicked Logan's forehead with a sharp knock. "Just go away!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander glanced back at the scripture, his mind racing. "Where did Timothy even get this? He probably wouldn't dare make it public. He was probably no longer a virgin when he got this treasure. Otherwise..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A wave of relief washed over Alexander. "Lucky me," he thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next morning, Alexander and Logan strolled toward the manor gate. Logan had been promoted to Alexander's personal attendant, which meant he no longer had to work in the melon fields.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When they arrived, they met with a massive crowd, all talking excitedly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If only I could get selected! I could train, join the army, and become a great general one day!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You idiot! If you become one of the lay disciples, it's only a matter of time before you become a priest!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
