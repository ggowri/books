  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander's gaze lingered as he watched the rich, inviting breasts in Yvonne's hands, shaped and molded by her touch. He swallowed hard, unable to deny her allure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Despite her disheveled, desperate state, she exuded an enticing charm that few men could resist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yet Alexander maintained his composure, restraining himself where most would have surrendered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yvonne took it a step further, pressing herself against Alexander's leg, wrapping herself around him, her full chest brushing against him as she whispered, "Please, let me be your woman. I refuse to be a mere servant."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When she saw Alexander's faint smile, her eyes sparkled with triumph. Men, after all, could not escape her charms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If she could become his woman, Yvonne felt certain she'd find an opportunity to turn the tables on him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Alexander's smile faded as his tone turned icy. "Do you think you have a choice?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He struck her forehead with a powerful hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Immediately, Yvonne felt a sharp, unbearable pain twist inside her, like a blade slicing her from within.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In less than a minute, she was driven to the brink of madness, ripping apart her robe, her bare skin exposed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Please, spare me! I'll be your woman, I swear. I know how to please a man... just give me a chance."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yvonne didn't want to be a servant, but she had already abandoned her pride.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>From across the room, Alyssa felt a pang of concern as she eyed Yvonne's enticing figure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She feared Alexander might actually accept her, falling for the temptation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Yvonne was a cunning seductress, and keeping her close would be like holding a ticking bomb.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Heh..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander's smirk widened, and without a trace of mercy, he kicked Yvonne away as she pleaded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She crumpled to the floor, convulsing in pain until she was barely able to move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her eyes, once fierce, now looked at him with desperation, her lips trembling as she struggled to form words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Serve me as my servant, and lead me to the City of Sorcery. Otherwise, I'll leave you to suffer a death of agony. I assure you, you won't last an hour."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His boyish smile belied the malice in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>To Yvonne, it looked as sinister as the devil's grin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Powerless, she nodded weakly, the last of her will broken under the threat of death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As Alexander saw her surrender, his eyes gleamed with satisfaction. Channeling his Force, he used his Force Control on her, diving into her consciousness to complete her subjugation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Remember, from now on, I am your master."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With her spirit subdued, Yvonne's voice quivered as she replied, "Master..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her once-bright eyes grew dull and vacant, her mind completely bent to Alexander's control.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Only then did he finally release her, withdrawing the Force from her body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She collapsed, gasping for air, her strength utterly drained.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In just a few minutes, all her strength was drained.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her bare skin glistened with sweat as though she'd been through an arduous ordeal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander looked down at her, his expression filled with commanding dominance that made her heart tremble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Master, I pledge to be your most loyal servant," she vowed, kneeling submissively before him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In her mind, Alexander was now everything&mdash;more essential than life itself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Pleased, Alexander allowed himself a satisfied smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Subjugating a powerful sorceress had cost him, too; sweat slicked his back, though he concealed it well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Turning to Yvonne, he asked, "Besides yourself, are there other agents from the City of Sorcery or the Mafia stationed in Mandale?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Obediently, she replied, "There is a unit of fifty under my command. I can summon them at your will."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Good." Alexander nodded. "Alyssa, head back and gather reinforcements. I'll have Yvonne lead them into our trap."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alyssa hesitated, concern in her eyes. "And what about you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander merely chuckled and waved her off, summoning the convoy that had been tailing them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As Alyssa departed with the others, he turned to Yvonne, still kneeling before him, stripped and completely subdued.</span></p><div class="pagination">
