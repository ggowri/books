"What do you mean? Do you think money makes you superior? Who cares about your filthy cash!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcos was taken aback, his confidence shaken.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Miss, I'm the famous singer Marcos from </span><span>Tijuanea</span><span>. My father is Caleb; </span><span>surely</span><span> you've heard of him?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He even tried to suavely brush his hair back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't know you, now go away.

Who the hell are you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcos glared at Alexander in fury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's attire was ordinary, and in terms of status, he surely couldn't compare to Marcos, who quickly regained some confidence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Brat, you're really pushing it. Give up your seat now, or you'll regret it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's expression grew stern; this shameless guy just wouldn't stop.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you deaf?

Let go... it hurts!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcos cried out, feeling his hand clamped like an iron vice, growing tighter and tighter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ow! Let go..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the next second, his pleas were abruptly cut off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander grabbed him by the neck and lifted him into the air like a hawk clutching a chick.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcos' face quickly darkened, his eyes nearly popping out.</span></p><div class="pagination">
