  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander had shot Ian in the right knee, leaving him disabled for life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fuck you! You dare shoot my leg? You're going to die for this! None of you three will make it out of Mandale Town alive. Bastards..." Ian spat angrily, his face contorted with rage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander fired another shot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both of Ian's legs were shattered, blood gushing. From that moment on, he could only crawl.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The scene fell silent. While gunfire and murder were not uncommon in Mandale, this level of brutality was unprecedented.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ian was part of the Mafia, a group everyone feared, and no one anticipated that Alexander would be so merciless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ian writhed in pain, howling in despair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The remaining men went pale, quickly stepping back, terrified that Alexander might turn his wrath on them next.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander approached Ian, stepping on his chest and pinning him to the ground. "I told you to get lost, but you didn't listen. This is your lesson. Next time you see me, you'd better run. Understand?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The murderous intent in Alexander's words terrified Ian, who nodded fervently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In his eyes, Alexander was a devil, and he wanted to survive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get out of here!" Alexander kicked Ian hard, sending him crashing down in front of his men.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get me out of here..." Ian shouted, relief flooding him for narrowly escaping death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His men finally snapped to attention and hurriedly lifted him, rushing away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, they accidentally dragged Ian's legs across the ground, causing him to howl in pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The heart-wrenching sound sent shivers through everyone present.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amidst the onlookers' gloating stares, Ian and his crew fled in humiliation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Mafia ruled Mandale Town, and everyone assumed Alexander would soon face severe retaliation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander, however, shrugged it off, waving his hand dismissively. "Let's go!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The three of them walked through the crowd, which parted instantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They dared not offend someone who could challenge even the Mafia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne, I'm afraid our search for the gemstones won't go smoothly now. The Mafia won't let this go easily. I didn't realize their influence in Soutaxia was so strong," Alice said, worry etched on her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ian would definitely reach out to the Mafia for help in dealing with them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Xavier hesitated, knowing Alexander was skilled but also aware they were outnumbered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A large group of Mafia experts could be dangerous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smiled and waved his hand again. "Don't worry. While the Mafia may have the numbers in Mandale Town, to me, they're just ants. Their numbers don't mean a thing."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The trio continued toward the gem trading center in Mandale Town.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, at Mandale Hospital, Ian was in the emergency room receiving treatment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His legs were thickly bandaged, and while the bleeding had stopped, the doctor announced that amputation was unavoidable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No! I don't want an amputation. I don't want to be disabled!" Ian screamed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He cursed with a ferocious expression, "Damn it! He broke both my legs. I won't let him get away with this. Just wait and see!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Call my brother immediately. He'll help me get my revenge," he shouted, knowing that if he lost his limbs, he'd spend the rest of his life in a wheelchair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, we'll notify Mr. Paxton Oldman right away!" several subordinates replied, too fearful to disobey Ian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paxton Oldman was Ian's older brother and the head of the Mafia in Mandale Town.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once the call connected, someone handed the phone to Ian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Paxton, it's Ian. My legs are broken. You have to help me get revenge!" Ian cried, his voice cracking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After detailing the incident, Ian hung up the phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That guy is finished! Paxton said he'll chop off his hands and feet and make him my slave. Hahaha! Alice, you won't escape either. Get ready to take care of me for the rest of your life," Ian vowed fiercely, his eyes burning with hatred and murderous intent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was determined to inflict the most brutal punishment on Alexander.</span></p><div class="pagination">
