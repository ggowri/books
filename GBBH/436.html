Ashley pulled the dazed Ella.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, okay, let's go..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ella obviously hesitated, gave Alexander a bitter smile, and then took Ashley into the kindergarten.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It seems a bit strange..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander looked at Ella's back and felt something was wrong.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because Ella's outfit was so sexy, she had never dressed like this before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Maybe she has a boyfriend."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander could feel the lust in Ella's eyes, and it was obvious that a man was nourishing her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander thought of the delicate bodies of beauties such as Ava and Betty and couldn't help but become excited.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hi!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A familiar and pleasant female voice came.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander turned around and saw that it was Meilin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melin was not wearing a police uniform but a black hip skirt. Her plump body was very attractive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sensing Alexander's burning gaze, Melin couldn't help but blush.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander became very excited, and his all-seeing Eyes looked through Melin's entire body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come here quickly, I have something to tell you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melin dragged Alexander into a black Buick.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The last time Alexander helped Melin detoxify was also in the car. Their eyes met, and the atmosphere gradually became ambiguous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander openly admired Melin's sexy figure, her plump, white breasts, her slim waist, and her long legs... He kept staring at her body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meilin felt hot all over and lowered her head shyly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a while, Melin couldn't stand Alexander's aggressive gaze anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey! Can you please stop looking at me like that? I have something important to discuss with you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, go ahead."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander directly pulled Meilin into his arms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melin leaned against him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She said in a serious tone, "There have been several cases of young women going missing recently. The culprit behind this may be related to the Red Umbrella Group. Ella has close contact with people from the Red Umbrella Group. You must be careful."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's expression immediately became serious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you have any evidence?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melin frowned and shook her head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There is no conclusive evidence yet, but there should be some soon. Because Ashley is Ella's student, I came here specifically to remind you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If I want to lure and catch the murderer of the missing case, can you help me then?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melin looked at Alexander with hope.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I will help you, but how are you going to thank me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smiled, put his hands on Melin's unusually plump breasts, and deftly unhooked her bra.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without any restraints, her breasts jumped out, it was so attractive that Alexander felt like even the air was filled with the tempting aroma of milk.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You can't do that in the car. There are too many people outside now. Don't do that!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melin felt hot all over, and her skin was flushed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's wrong? This is privacy glass. They can't see what we do from outside."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander held Melin on his lap, covered her sexy lips with his big mouth, and his hands started touching her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmm!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melin froze immediately, her beautiful eyes widened, and she hugged Alexander's neck tightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The wonderful touch made the two of them intoxicated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melin was like she was struck by lightning, and her mind went blank.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wherever Alexander touched and kissed, she felt numb and tingling, as if she was floating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She grabbed Alexander's arm tightly with both hands and stared with eyes wide open.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She said, "No! Not in the car... There are so many people outside... We'll be discovered..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smiled and easily stripped Melin naked, leaving only a black thong between her buttocks, which was extremely charming.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're so annoying!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melin pretended to be reluctant. She wanted to push him away but couldn't. She felt embarrassed and anxious, and she loved and hated him at the same time.</span></p><div class="pagination">
