  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander wrapped his arm around Rebecca's slender waist, keeping her from leaving. At the same time, he took off her bikini.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, Rebecca appeared naked in front of Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well... Alexander... I want you!" Rebecca hooked her arm around his neck and reached out to caress him skillfully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander laughed and teased her deliberately, "Didn't you just say that I was too bad? Who is bad?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, you are so bad!" Rebecca pouted, looking at him with a mix of playful annoyance and anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her body was like a ripe peach. Once her desire was ignited by her lover, it could not </span><span>be quenched until she was satisfied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander no longer hesitated. He pushed her down on the chair and pressed on her. Their bodies entangled together.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not far away, on the balcony, Ava was crouched behind the railing, her eyes wide as she watched everything unfold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom, they're starting..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lynn's eyes were also wide open as if she were afraid of missing the scene.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She pulled Ava into her arms, their cheeks rubbing together as they gently moved, and then she cupped Ava's face, kissing her repeatedly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava couldn't help laughing out loud.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom, your lips are making me so ticklish."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Good girl, you smell so sweet."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lynn had already kissed her way down to Ava's neck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well... Mom, what do you want to do? Are you... are you going to teach me how to serve a man here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why? Can't I?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lynn ran both her hands down Ava's smooth shoulders, and her bikini slid off her body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah!" Ava couldn't help but exclaim. Instinctively, she wrapped her arms around herself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Be good, let mommy love you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava was pressed down by Lynn, and her soft buttocks were gently caressed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Um..." Without realizing it, Ava and Lynn were kissing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their full and beautiful bodies were entwined, writhing. Soft moans escaped intermittently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No... Alexander will find out..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava trembled suddenly more intensely. It turned out that Lynn had already gotten into the next step.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She said no but couldn't resist, her actions both rejecting and inviting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lynn was very familiar with Ava. This wasn't the first time. She knew her sensitive points.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My dear, are you comfortable?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lynn kissed and licked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Um..." Ava closed her eyes. She felt as if she was about to float up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although she wasn't a man, she understood women better. She could rely on many techniques to bring her pleasure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No... No... Alexander and Rebecca will discover..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry, silly girl. As long as you keep your voice down, they definitely won't notice from this far away."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lynn was not only skilled with her hands, but even more so with her mouth. It was already clear that Ava's body was beginning to twitch slightly, her reactions growing more intense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even if they find out, so what? Would Alexander mind? As for Rebecca, didn't she already... with you and Alex..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop talking, I'm so embarrassed!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava's expression was dreamy. She was already lost in it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She instinctively tensed her body, the tingling sensation growing stronger and stronger, feeling as if she was about to reach her limit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing this, Lynn did not stop but moved faster and harder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hold on, the longer, the better. Only by training like this for a long time can you keep a strong man like Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"After you're married, you wouldn't want him to go out and find another woman, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lynn's words immediately made Ava grit her teeth in the struggle. Even though her body had reached its limit, feeling as though even the slightest touch would make her lose control, she still held on, trying to delay the inevitable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She knew that once she finished, there would be a feeling of exhaustion and weakness afterward. Some women, especially those with lower stamina, could even collapse, unable to hold themselves up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But no matter how much Ava tried to endure and hold on, that overwhelming sensation continued to build, growing more intense and exciting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Lynn was focused on her task, and Ava clung tightly to her.</span></p><div class="pagination">
