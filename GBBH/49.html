  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Andrew's wails shattered the silence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Jane! Who'd have thought Ryan would prove so useless? And now Alexander has become Ms. Blackburn's boyfriend. What on earth are we going to do?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Belinda's voice cracked with emotion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Alexander is sure to come after us. What if the Saint Group decides to wipe out our entire family?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The Fairfax clan chimed in with their fears.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"We're in danger here. Maybe Jane should beg Alexander for mercy and appeal to their history together."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Jane did give Alexander a daughter, after all. If she pleads with him, he might even rekindle their relationship on the down-low. We could use that connection to tap into the Saint Group's influence."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Exactly! Men can't keep it in their pants. As they say, a mistress beats a wife, and a fling beats a mistress. Jane, if you work your charms on Alexander, he's bound to let us off the hook."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As more people pitched in with their dubious suggestions, Andrew and Belinda's eyes lit up with a glimmer of hope.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Andrew slapped his thigh eagerly and blurted out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Jane, your uncles have a point! Doll yourself up and get Alexander alone in a hotel room. It'll work wonders, I'm telling you!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jane's face flushed red, then pale with anger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Dad, what the hell are you talking about? Alexander and I are divorced. How can you ask me to seduce him?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Andrew suddenly burst into loud sobs.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Oh, come on, sweetie! It's not like you two haven't done the deed before. What's the big deal?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If he let Ms. Blackburn against us, do you think the Fairfax family's got a snowball's chance in hell of staying in Loscity? We'd be lucky to make it out alive for crying out loud!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The rest of the Fairfax clan chimed in, begging Jane to go through with it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jane was at her wit's end. The thought of seducing Alexander again was too much to stomach.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She was kicking herself, too. If she'd known it'd come to this, she never would've betrayed Alexander for Ryan.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Under the relentless pressure from her folks and relatives, Jane finally caved.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Alright, I'll see Alexander tomorrow."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As soon as Jane said those words, she felt a sudden wave of relief wash over her, accompanied by an unexpected surge of anticipation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She hadn't been intimated with Alexander since her affair with Ryan began.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Back in the day, Alexander was obsessed with her body. If she put on some sexy lingerie, he'd probably pounce on her like a wolf.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Hah! Ava, I bet you can't hold a candle to me in the sack."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jane felt a twinge of smug satisfaction.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She used to refuse Alexander's requests for her to wear lingerie, saving that only for Ryan. But things were different now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">*****</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava drove Alexander to the mansion's entrance herself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After the car stopped, Alexander didn't immediately open the door. Instead, he planted a kiss on Ava's cheek.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A beautiful smile played on Ava's lips as she said, "Being with you feels like my first love all over again."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander spoke earnestly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Thank you. I'm grateful for your trust and how much you value me. Besides Lily and James, no one has ever treated me this well. I promise I'll find a way to repay you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava burst into laughter, gently caressing Alexander's face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She playfully scolded, "You silly goose. How could you possibly repay me? All I want is for you to be safe and happy. The Brilliant Group and The Cripples are our enemies now. You need to be careful."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander scoffed, "I'm not worried about them. But I am concerned about Sir Stewart's grandson..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava froze. "What do you mean?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander joked, "I'm worried Sir Stewart's grandson might become my rival in love."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Oh, stop it! Do you think I'm some fickle woman who jumps from one man to another?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava playfully pinched Alexander's cheek, her face flushed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Though... if Sir Stewart's grandson turns out to be quite the catch, I might have to give him a chance," she teased, abruptly changing the subject.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander chuckled ruefully. He knew Ava was joking, but he couldn't help thinking that a woman as beautiful, charming, and capable as her must-have countless impressive suitors vying for her attention.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Are you jealous?" Ava asked, eyeing Alexander with keen interest.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The atmosphere in the car suddenly became charged. Their eyes locked, and they could almost hear each other's quickening heartbeats.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Unable to resist, Alexander placed his hand on Ava's smooth thigh, gently caressing it.</p><div class="pagination">
