  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That evening, Ashley was tired from preschool, so she went to bed early.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ava, I got you something."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander pulled out a few sets of lingerie he'd bought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava blushed, laughing and scolding him, "This isn't even clothing. These are just scraps of fabric! You're such a naughty guy!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hehe, didn't you say you'd wear it for me? And it's not all just fabric. Look, there's mesh too! So sexy and gorgeous."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander picked up a piece of lingerie to show her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Enough with the teasing, let's talk business. I heard there was a fight with the Blood Gang today. Were you involved?" Ava asked seriously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander paused, surprised that word had already spread.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He briefly explained how Mary had asked him for help, though he left out the details of their more intimate interactions afterward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava's eyes sparkled with excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If Mary can unify the Blood Gang's power and side with us, that'd be fantastic news.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But why did she come to you for help, specifically? Is there... something between you two?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava looked at Alexander, curious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander felt a bit uneasy and gave a nervous chuckle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What are you talking about? You're the only one in my heart."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wrapped an arm around Ava's waist, gently caressing her hips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava rolled her eyes at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As if you don't already have enough women around you. One more or less doesn't make a difference. Who's to say you won't get bored of me one day and toss me aside?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander shook his head immediately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't say that! You're the one I love most. If I ever leave you, may I go straight to hell!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's oath lifted Ava's spirits considerably.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava sighed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Men are always smooth talkers. Once you've had enough, you're bound to stop caring."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How could that happen? You're so attractive. Not only beautiful but with a perfect figure. A nice, full bottom like yours is perfect for having sons."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander complimented her as he gave her hips a playful squeeze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava allowed him to get close, lying softly in his arms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander grinned and said, "Put on the black mesh bodysuit. I want to see it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava playfully rolled her eyes at him, then shyly unpacked it, taking off her clothes and undoing her bra.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her ample, fair curves bounced free, full but firm, a sign she hadn't had many encounters with men.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The little blushes around her curves were still an enticing pink.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Gulp..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's mouth went dry, and he swallowed hard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava then slipped off her jeans, revealing a seductive white thong.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blushing, she took off her thong as well, standing fully exposed, her soft curves and fair skin looking like a flawless work of art.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander couldn't help but clench his fists.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava picked up the black mesh bodysuit, slid her fair legs into it, and elegantly wrapped it around her body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The black mesh hugged her fair skin tightly, pressing against her full curves, some parts even pushing out slightly through the mesh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her entire body was enveloped in the mesh, with certain areas open, making her look irresistibly full and alluring.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you like it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava swayed her hips, raising her bottom to show Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander felt a tightness inside as desire burned fiercely within him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"During the meeting today at the company, I suddenly missed you so much. I really wanted you beside me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava spoke softly, her eyes fixed on Alexander's lower abdomen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander looked pleased, knowing that any woman he'd been with was always left completely captivated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, for a man, only what he had in his pants could truly win over a woman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thanks to the Force, Alexander's prowess in that area grew stronger by the day.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I want to touch..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava moved closer eagerly, her full curves trembling, revealing an enticing white valley.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unable to resist, Alexander reached out and began to knead her gently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah, you must've been touching other women lately. Your technique's better than before."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava shivered involuntarily, a hint of jealousy in her voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why are you jealous? You're the only one in my heart right now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander pretended to be annoyed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come here, let me check if you've been with any other man."</span></p><div class="pagination">
