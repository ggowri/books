  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The battered door finally gave way, and Norah burst through it with several dozen people behind her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was wounded and covered in blood, her face etched with exhaustion, but she still moved like lightning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you! Gosh, thank you so much!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Norah dropped to her knees in front of Alexander. She had watched him and his team fight through waves of monsters, risking their lives just to save her group, and her gratitude overwhelmed her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a collective thud, dozens of blood-covered men, their faces drawn with fatigue, dropped to one knee.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They'd thought they were goners for sure, but somehow rescue had come just when they'd lost all hope.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The scene was unreal&mdash;Alexander's team laying down heavy fire while he and his two companions drove back thousands of mutant beasts. The survivors couldn't help but stare in awe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander Hawthorne," Alexander said, giving Norah an appraising look. "You folks with the Sunrise Group?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Norah was a striking woman, with a gorgeous face, a killer figure, and a commanding presence that radiated confidence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wait, you're Mr. Hawthorne?" Her eyes went wide. "My dad is Karson!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She could barely contain her excitement. Maybe there was hope for Louvian Port after all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's expression cleared with recognition as Norah explained how they'd gotten trapped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he learned they'd deliberately drawn the mutant beasts away, he couldn't help but respect their guts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sure, they were beaten up and exhausted, cuts and bruises everywhere. But there was something about them&mdash;a stubborn refusal to give up that he only saw in people who'd been through real war. These weren't just survivors&mdash;they were elite fighters.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You did good, Norah," Alexander said with approval. "But watch yourself next time. You might not get lucky enough to have me show up again. Come on, let's get you all back to Louvian Port."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After linking up with Augusta and Marvin, Alexander led the convoy racing toward Louvian Port.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The powerful rumble of engines filled the air, and Norah's group felt their confidence surging back. Everyone believed they'd make it out of this mess alive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, they'd just watched Alexander's team push back thousands of mutant beasts&mdash;which was absolutely insane.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Chapman!" a burly guy shouted at the top of his lungs. "Ms. Chapman's back, and they've brought a whole convoy!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His announcement instantly drew everyone's attention.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"For real? We've got backup? Is it the military?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd froze for a second as the news sank in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We're saved! Someone actually came for us!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Quick, let's welcome Ms. Chapman! We owe her big time!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A thousand people went absolutely nuts, swarming toward the main gate like a tidal wave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By the time the gates opened and Alexander's convoy rolled in, the crowd had packed themselves shoulder-to-shoulder along both sides.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone was shaking with excitement, their faces lit up with hope they couldn't contain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Chapman!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Karson spotted Alexander, his face broke into the biggest grin imaginable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smiled warmly as he shook hands with an enthusiastic Karson.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Karson eagerly introduced his daughter again, making Norah blush as the attention turned to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander maintained his gentlemanly smile while his gaze took in Norah's curvy figure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne, we're looking at a hundred thousand monsters in this wave," Karson said, his excitement fading. "We're running low on ammo... What are we going to do?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The earlier joy had drained from Karson's face, replaced by worry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander looked at their concerned faces and gave them a reassuring smile. "Don't sweat it. I brought plenty of heavy artillery and bullets this time. It should be enough to hold them off. I've already briefed the military on the situation, so backup should be on its way."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But those mutant beasts are going to attack us soon!" Karson carefully voiced his concern. "Won't that be dangerous?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No need to panic," Alexander replied. "They have a weakness. That's how we managed to rescue Ms. Chapman. We found their weak spot."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Karson's eyes lit up at Alexander's words, hope mixing with surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The mutant monkeys are the key," Alexander explained. "Sure, these beasts got smarter after mutating, but they're nowhere near human intelligence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The only reason they can coordinate is because of those mutant monkeys pulling the strings. It's like chess. We take out the king, and the game's over. Once we eliminate those monkeys, the rest won't be able to put up much of a fight!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's confidence radiated through the group, instantly lifting everyone's spirits and washing away their doubts.</span></p><div class="pagination">
