  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma opened the door and pushed Alexander inside. The door locked behind them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne, thank you for saving my daughter." Emma's voice dripped with </span><span>sugar. S</span><span>he was born with that kind of </span><span>tempting vibe</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne, there's no need to be nervous</span><span>. Just relax</span><span>..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander held back a sigh. Seemed like there was no avoiding something happening with Emma today.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Mrs. Duncan</span><span>, if you're not nervous, I'm definitely not nervous," </span><span>Alexander</span><span> said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma's beautiful eyes sparkled with an expression that was hard to read.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've been having some neck problems," she explained with a smile. "I was hoping you could help with a massage. You wouldn't say no, </span><span>right</span><span>?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander gave a knowing smile. "Well, you came to the right person. I </span><span>actually </span><span>know</span><span> medical </span><span>skills. T</span><span>reating people is </span><span>my thing</span><span>."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're a doctor?" Emma looked at him with surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander kept his response deliberately vague.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh..." Emma let out a sigh, then continued in a </span><span>sweet</span><span> voice, "It's such a shame I'm not younger. A talented man like you would've been exactly my type."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander took in her curvy figure. "You're not old at all," he said. "Honestly, you could pass for your daughter's slightly older sister."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma's face lit up with delight. "Really? Would you call me Emma then?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander couldn't help stealing a glance at the tempting glimpse of soft skin on her breasts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since there wasn't anything special between him and Maxine, he figured there was no harm in it. "Emma, sit properly and let me help with your neck pain."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You got it!" Emma beamed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander </span><span>was a little confused. Calling her Emma</span><span> could bring her so much joy</span><span>?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But </span><span>soon he understood it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma's husband had been </span><span>taken away by some bad guys</span><span>, and she'd been through </span><span>a lot</span><span> as a woman alone, desperately trying to save </span><span>her husband</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma was seducing him on purpose, because this woman was afraid that he would abandon her and her daughter under the pressure from Silver Shield Security. She was desperately trying to win his favor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, if he partnered with Silver Shield Security, </span><span>her husband </span><span>Alvin</span><span> would be dead meat. S</span><span>he and Maxine would be finished, too.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Should I... keep my clothes on?" Emma asked, her cheeks flushed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's lips curved into a slight smile. "You could... though it might be easier without them..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then I should probably take them off. It'll make the treatment easier, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without waiting for his response, Emma began unbuttoning her blouse with surprising poise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As each button came undone, her curves were gradually revealed, her full breasts swaying gently with each movement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's gaze traveled appreciatively over Emma's figure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had the kind of softness that suited her perfectly&mdash;just the right </span><span>amount</span><span> of curves in all the right places. Her collarbones created delicate shadows above her shoulders, and her proportions were </span><span>absolutely stunning</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What are you waiting for, Mr. Hawthorne</span><span>?</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma's pretty face had taken on a rosy tint as she gave Alexander a meaningful glance before turning away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander snapped out of his daze and slowly placed his hands on Emma's shoulders.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her skin was silky smooth. One would never guess she'd had a child. Alexander began channeling the Force, his fingers working methodically along her neck in </span><span>gentle massage movements.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma shivered suddenly, letting out a startled gasp.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She felt an incredibly warm energy flood into her body, spreading through her entire system and washing away every trace of fatigue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The nagging pain in her neck melted away, replaced by a deep sense of comfort and relief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne." Emma breathed, clearly impressed. "I had no idea you were actually skilled at healing."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Emma received Alexander's treatment, she rambled on, pleading with him to save her husband.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander felt a wave of sympathy as he listened to Emma pour out her heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He slowed his movements, his hands gently massaging her shoulders in circular motions as he offered quiet words of comfort.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, Emma's tears subsided. Then, with a sudden shift in tone, she spoke in a hushed voice, "You know... my life hasn't been easy. My husband... </span><span>H</span><span>e's </span><span>got impotent issues</span><span>. For </span><span>recent </span><span>three years, he hasn't been able to </span><span>have sex</span><span> with me. </span><span>My life isn&rsquo;t that good</span><span>."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her cheeks flushed as she gazed at Alexander with vulnerable eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was caught off guard. "Three years?" he asked, puzzled. "</span><span>So w</span><span>hy haven't you</span><span> </span><span>divorce</span><span>d him</span><span>?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh..." Emma let out a soft sigh. "Even without sex... I still </span><span>care about</span><span> him. And I don't want our daughter to worry..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She fell silent for a moment before continuing, "I have a husband by my side, yet I've spent these three years feeling completely alone. Who could possibly understand</span><span> my feelings</span><span>?"</span></p><div class="pagination">
