  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Since the other party is a dark wizard, he must be related to the City of Wizards. Mr. Thompson, please give me a copy of the intelligence on the City of Wizardry."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The military's intelligence system was the most powerful, so they must know many secrets of the City of Sorcery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quentin agreed without hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay, I will send you the information about the Red Umbrella Group and the City of Sorcery as soon as possible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry about the price the military paid for the magic powder. Leave everything to me. As for Schroder, he died in the hospital on his own, so this incident definitely has nothing to do with you, Mr. Hawthorne."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quentin looked serious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smiled and thought Quentin was indeed cunning. This was the outcome he had expected long ago.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry, Mr. Thompson. I will follow the clues and catch the murderer in one fell swoop."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quentin nodded repeatedly and didn't take Alexander's words seriously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The City of Sorcery was so powerful that even the military did not want to provoke it easily. The dark wizard was definitely a high-ranking figure in the City of Sorcery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Alexander was mighty, it was impossible for him to find the City of Sorcery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this time, Brittany asked worriedly, "Mr. Hawthorne, since the dark wizard came to harm Scott, I'm afraid he will cause trouble for my grandpa. Do you have any way to help us avoid the harm of witchcraft?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she spoke, she looked at the broken necklace with an expression of regret.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Of course, Alexander understood what she meant and couldn't help but take a few glances at her towering breasts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brittany felt his burning gaze, and her face suddenly turned red, but she did not dodge. Instead, she looked at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Thompson, I can indeed make a protective necklace to resist the invasion of ordinary witchcraft, but this kind of necklace requires a lot of </span><span>Spellweave</span><span> Pattern to be carved, which is extremely time-consuming and costly..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander pretended to ponder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, Brittany said quickly, "Is it the necklace that can resist witchcraft insects? As long as you offer a price, the Thompson family can still afford it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quentin quickly agreed, "Yes, Mr. Hawthorne, if you can spare some time to help us make the protective necklace, just tell me what conditions you need, and I will definitely do it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander nodded reluctantly. Since there was money to be made, he definitely couldn't miss it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay, then when I have time, I will definitely make a few for you to protect yourself. However, this kind of necklace will cost at least tens of millions of dollars, or even hundreds of millions of dollars. You should be mentally prepared."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quentin made up his mind and said, "Don't worry, Mr. Hawthorne. Tens of millions is </span><span>not a problem. After all, witchcraft is too terrifying and hard to guard against."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The horrific scene of Alexander exorcising the witchcraft insects still shuddered when he thought of it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, he turned to Brittany and said, "Brittany, please send Mr. Hawthorne off and spend more time with him around </span><span>Tijuanea</span><span>. After all, you are young people and have a lot of common topics."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quentin smiled and patted her shoulder, obviously hinting at something.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was stunned for a moment, then looked at him with a strange expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brittany understood what Quentin meant. It was obvious that he thought Alexander was good-looking and capable, so he wanted her to get to know him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay, grandpa. I got it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brittany agreed with a blushing face. She had a good impression of Alexander and was very fond of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander understood the implied meaning of Quentin's words and suddenly didn't know what to say.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne, I'll take you there."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brittany took the initiative to extend the invitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two walked outside together, neither of them speaking, feeling a little awkward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They arrived next to a BMW 7 Series. Brittany took out the car keys and said, "As a newcomer to </span><span>Tijuanea</span><span>, I'll give you this car as a gift. It's more convenient to have a car."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brittany gave him the car keys.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander didn't hesitate to take the key and got into the car excitedly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He started the BMW, waved to Brittany, and sped away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, she watched the BMW quickly disappear from her sight, and her emotions became extremely complicated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every woman fantasized about her own Prince Charming, and Alexander was of the right age, and both his abilities and handsome looks met her requirements.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this time, Quentin came over, and they looked in the direction where Alexander left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, Brittany couldn't help but ask, "Grandpa, do you really want me to date Alexander? Although he has good conditions, his family background is definitely far inferior to ours."</span></p><div class="pagination">
