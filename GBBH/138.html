  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander watched Jimbo's </span><span>performance,</span><span> his eyes filled with contempt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm no wizard. I don't pick fights, but I won't back down when someone comes looking for trouble."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jimbo's face turned pale as he pleaded. "Mr. Hawthorne, I swear it's a misunderstanding...I'll leave </span><span>Loscity</span><span> and never return."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he slowly backed away, hoping for a chance to escape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Since you wanted to kill me, you can forget about leaving." Alexander's aura intensified, radiating lethal intent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jimbo trembled, his expression darkening.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander suspected Jimbo still had tricks up his sleeve as a gray wizard, so he stayed alert.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, instead of raging, Jimbo took a calm stance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, I suggest you let me go. If not, we'll both go down together!" He held up the figurine, his face contorted with malice. "If you keep pushing, I'll make sure you pay. Think about it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Make me then." Alexander advanced, closing in on Jimbo.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jimbo flinched. "Won't you reconsider? My master has already captured your woman. If you keep going, she might get hurt."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's heart skipped, and he immediately called Ava.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was fast asleep. Alexander told her to lock her doors and windows, then asked Augusta to secretly guard her with Marvin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lying to me will only make me angrier!" Alexander watched Jimbo's every expression carefully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jimbo's face darkened as he backed away. Alexander continued advancing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Since your master Drake is here, I'll take you to him. Let's see how much he values his apprentice."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Screw you!" Jimbo cursed, biting his tongue and spitting blood onto the figurine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instantly, Alexander felt his body stiffen, trapped by an invisible force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jimbo's face lit up with triumph.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ha! I thought you were tough, Alexander, but you just act tough. Now that you're immobilized, I can kill you however I please."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He pulled out a dagger and charged, but before he could get close, Alexander unleashed the Force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Crack! Deep fissures split across the sorcery figurine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Regaining movement, Alexander watched as Jimbo spat out blood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Crack! The closer Alexander got, the more the figurine shattered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It crumbled to pieces on the ground, turning into dust.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jimbo let out a pitiful scream, clutching his chest as he collapsed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You...you're not a wizard. What are you, really?" He cried out in terror, crawling away from Alexander in desperation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander stepped forward, pressing his foot onto Jimbo's right hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sound of bones cracking filled the air, twisting Jimbo's hand into a mangled shape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One by one, Alexander rendered Jimbo's limbs useless before lifting him up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though Jimbo was just a gray wizard with a broken trump card, Alexander remained cautious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Drake had carried </span><span>Lara</span><span> into a secluded forest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Help! Who are you? Let me go!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lara</span><span> struggled fiercely, trying to claw at Drake's face and kicking his chest with her heels, though Drake restrained her easily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Keep acting up, and I'll cut up your pretty face. Let's see how you like being ugly." He drew a dagger, placing it against her smooth cheek.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The blade's edge cut into her skin, drawing thin lines of blood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No! Don't touch me. Name your price, and I'll pay anything." </span><span>Lara</span><span> was frozen in fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As a woman, her looks and body were her greatest assets. She thought Drake only wanted a ransom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Drake pinned her to a tree trunk, then suddenly removed his hood.</span></p><div class="pagination">
