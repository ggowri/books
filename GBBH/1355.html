  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was taken aback and silently grumbled about Quinton being too stingy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Quinton, who was in the palace calling his ministers, sensed someone was grumbling about him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Noticing Alexander's gloomy expression, Sellers stepped in to clarify, "Alexander, His Majesty has granted you a fief of three miles, but you'll need to buy it or expand the territory. Within these three miles, you're the king&mdash;you can command cavalry and infantry, and you have the authority to recruit a thousand elite soldiers."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander realized that the Sahasia was vast. The government wouldn't simply hand over territory but rather encouraged its expansion, with purchase options available as well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Some might argue that this was no different from being a local landlord, but there was a significant difference. In this territory, he was a leader with power over life and death; he could raise an army based on the size of his domain and build his own forces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No wonder they called it a great reward and honor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander felt a surge of joy. He was just a common man, toiling daily for a living, but now he was a regional ruler, albeit the smallest one.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He grabbed a metal rod and shouted, "Come on, guys! I'm in a great mood today&mdash;let's celebrate together!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Five minutes later, Alexander yelled, "Ouch, be gentle!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hogan, how did you become a level-three warrior?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you all serious? Stop! I said stop!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By dusk, Alexander returned to his courtyard with a flushed face and the scent of alcohol clinging to him. He collapsed onto his large bed and began to reflect deeply.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He realized he couldn't afford to relax or feel too proud when it came to martial arts. Today, Hogan had seemed the weakest, yet he was a level-three warrior.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander needed to break into the fourth level as soon as possible. The thought of battling Arturo sent a shiver down his spine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A level-four warrior possessed a body and mind in perfect harmony, with bones like steel, marrow like frost, and blood like mercury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Arturo's blood was merely mixed with silver; he probably wasn't even at his peak as a level-four warrior.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The power of level-four warriors was staggering, and Alexander wondered just how formidable level-five warriors could be.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It had been four months since Alexander joined the church. He had a silver badge and had accumulated four thousand martial virtue points during that time, bringing his total to one hundred and four thousand. However, he was uncertain about what to exchange them for.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He decided to visit the Martial Virtue Hall to check the Martial Virtue Point List and then head over to the Manual House and the Treasure House.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Initially, upon joining the outer courtyard, he had received over 10 million coins. He gained another 10 million after defeating Finn and then 80 million from the Walgus Church, totaling over one hundred million coins. He was now a millionaire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both the Manual House and Treasure House required money. Should he purchase the land now or wait to expand later? He needed to discuss it with Logan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julius was a powerful figure with many lackeys who often bullied him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Uncertainty loomed about what trouble Julius might cause, so Alexander had to secure 30 miles of land and recruit soldiers as soon as possible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander had heard from Sellers that there was a slave market in Darwin and considered buying some people there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"When I get land, I will build a manor. The bed needs to be big and sturdy," he mused.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As these thoughts swirled, Alexander drank too much and eventually fell asleep, a grin on his face. It seemed that whenever he was in a good mood, a mysterious aura of power seeped into his body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next morning, Alexander practiced martial arts as usual. In the afternoon, he went to Emerald Manor to summon Logan and enlisted Sellers and his brothers as guides to head to the slave market in Darwin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The slave market was located in a secluded part of Darwin. The post office charged 10 coins per person for each transfer. After passing through several post offices and spending a hefty amount of silver, they finally spotted a massive flagpole in the distance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A black flag waved high above, emblazoned with the word "Slave."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they walked and talked, Alexander and Logan began to understand the reasoning behind the existence of a slave market.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hrodvik was thriving, and its citizens lived in peace and contentment. Even those employed as servants or maids in wealthy households were not considered slaves, and they had no power over life and death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The government banned the buying and selling of Hrodvik citizens as slaves, and no one wished to become one, except for those seeking to be lackeys.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The slaves traded in the market were primarily foreigners sold by various ethnic slave traders and prisoners of war from past conflicts, including some highly skilled martial artists.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, it was often challenging to manage powerful martial artists as slaves since they were more likely to rebel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sandwiches, one coin each!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Check this out! Freshly hunted bear pelts, white tiger skins, and all kinds of delicacies."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Our store has just received a new shipment of premium silk!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As they drew closer to the slave market, Alexander noticed that the road was bustling with shops, stalls, and vendors. The atmosphere was lively, with people jostling shoulder to shoulder.</span></p><div class="pagination">
