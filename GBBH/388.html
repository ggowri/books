  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander laughed out loud.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm almost afraid of ending up in jail. Maybe I should let you go back. Once you're there, pass on a message to Felix at the Red Umbrella Group for me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tell him to get ready, because I'll show him what real fear feels like. I'll make him experience the slow crawl of death."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander finished and placed his hand on Bernard's forehead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A thin stream of Force slipped silently into Bernard's mind. It's a skill Alexander had mastered since advancing to Intermediate Warrior.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Force Annihilation!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Force Annihilation not only inflicted immediate, intense damage but also silently eroded the body, destroying cells and causing excruciating pain until it brought a slow, agonizing death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bernard was now like meat on a butcher's block; if Alexander wanted him dead, it would take only a thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What...what did you do to me?" Bernard asked, terrified.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bernard's heart pounded as an intense chill spread through his body after Alexander's touch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's smile, his actions, and the sheer menace radiating from him filled Bernard with pure terror.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't help but deeply regret ever crossing such a dangerous man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get out!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander commanded, looking at Bernard as if he were already dead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bernard froze, stammering, "What...what did you say?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I said get out!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander kicked him down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bernard's face turned pale, and without a word, he turned and ran.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He now realized that Alexander was no weakling living off of women. He was truly powerful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bernard scrambled out of the estate, driving away at breakneck speed while frantically calling the police...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, a large police force arrived at the estate, personally led by Oliver.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the estate was empty. Not only was Eddie's body gone, but even the bloodstains had vanished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There wasn't a soul at The Cripples' headquarters; the entire estate had an eerie, unexplainable atmosphere.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Oliver scowled as he asked, "Mr. Clifford, are you lying? There's nobody here, not even any blood!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bernard was speechless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Standing nearby, Melin kept silent, feeling a rush of warmth as she recalled the time Alexander had helped her with the detox.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately, she hadn't seen Alexander since their goodbye at the hospital. He was always busy, and he had no shortage of women around him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melin had looked into Alexander's life and found that women like Ava, Rebecca, and Betty were all close to him. The thought left her feeling a bit jealous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmph!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melin glared at Bernard, scolding, "Bernard, you're wasting public resources and slandering Mr. Hawthorne. That's grounds for legal action."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm not! You...you're all in on this with Alexander. This is infuriating..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Furious, Bernard turned and stormed off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melin glared at Bernard's back, muttering, "Alexander, you jerk. Just wait until I catch you; I'll give you a good lesson!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Oliver looked thoughtfully at Melin, giving a knowing smile without saying a word.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was at the height of his power, and Oliver wasn't about to risk crossing him without solid proof.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A few hours later, Bernard stumbled into the </span><span>Loscity</span><span> Grand Hotel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inside the hotel's top-floor presidential suite, Bernard entered and dropped to his knees in front of Felix on the sofa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Welcome to </span><span>Loscity</span><span>, Mr. Vanderbilt. Please, help us get revenge!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix, reclining with one leg crossed over the other, looked at Bernard with displeasure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And why would I help you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bernard's face fell, and he gritted his teeth, saying, "Because Alexander is our common enemy!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You mentioned that Alexander had a message for me. What do you mean?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A murderous glint and a hint of confusion flashed in Felix's deep eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bernard nodded repeatedly. "He said that. He wants you to experience true fear, to feel the approach of death..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He repeated Alexander's message word for word.</span></p><div class="pagination">
