  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both front tires were punctured by metal caltrops, and jagged remnants of the sharp triangles littered the road. It was clear that someone had set this trap on purpose.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, a massive explosion erupted from the distance. A fireball lit up the night as the Land Rover that had gone ahead to scout was blown to bits.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marvin's eyes widened his face twisted with rage as he watched the flames from the explosion lick the dark sky.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Team One! Do you copy?" William's voice came through over the radio, his tone urgent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All he got in response was a crackling silence, static filling the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Minutes passed before the radio finally came to life, a breathless, desperate voice breaking through. "William! This is Carson Mercer, Team One's captain! We're under attack... Ambush! We need backup now! We're pinned down!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"An ambush?" William's voice hardened. "Everyone, stay sharp!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The team quickly scrambled out of the vehicles, instinctively seeking cover behind rocks and trees, their weapons raised, scanning the darkened surroundings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beyond the reach of their headlights, the world was an impenetrable black void. Nothing moved, but that only made it feel like danger was lurking just beyond their sight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marvin snorted, his voice low and cold, "They're after something in our vehicles, no doubt. Otherwise, they would've hit us head-on."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>William's gaze swept over the rugged terrain. The hills were steep and densely forested, perfect for hiding and ideal for an ambush.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were no sheer cliffs but a maze of hills linked together, winding and treacherous, the kind of landscape that made the enemy hard to spot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marvin quickly assessed the situation. The flipped Land Rover and the one that had been blown apart had cost them six men in total.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their team of thirty had already lost twenty percent of their strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>William gave a sharp nod, his jaw clenched. "Team Two, follow me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He motioned for the other vehicles, and without hesitation, they sped toward the battlefield.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone was geared up, Ultimate Alliance insignia on their chests, rifles slung over their shoulders, combat knives at the ready, radios crackling in their hands, and enough grenades and smoke bombs to turn the tide of any fight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Team One was holed up, the remaining five survivors doing their best to hold off the ambush, huddled behind rocks, firing back as the enemy shot from the shadows.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not long ago, their two Land Rovers had driven right into a field of caltrops. Tires shredded instantly, and then the first vehicle was hit by a rocket.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The explosion had taken out the first Land Rover entirely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The second had miraculously dodged the next rocket, saving the five survivors who were now locked in a desperate gunfight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it hadn't been for their luck, the flaming wrecks of both vehicles would've blocked the road completely, trapping the convoy in a deadly crossfire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sharp staccato of gunfire echoed in the night as the battle raged on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The ambushers weren't many, but they were sharp, trained, skilled, and deadly accurate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Within moments, two members of Team One were hit, their bodies jerking as blood sprayed out onto the rocky ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the elite fighters of Ultimate Alliance weren't about to back down. Silver Shield Security's All-purpose Bullet-resistant Jackets had saved their lives. Their wounds weren't fatal, just painful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They pushed through the pain, taking cover behind anything they could as they returned fire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Another rocket shot out, cutting through the night, trailing a stream of fire, and slammed into the second Land Rover.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The explosion was deafening. The vehicle was hurled into the air in a blaze of flame and debris. Chunks of metal, shattered glass, and rocks rained down in all directions, the ground trembling under the force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A muffled crack sounded as a sniper's rifle took its shot, piercing the chaos.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A scream ripped through the air, and a fiery explosion erupted in the trees, signaling that the sniper had hit his target.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes! They lost their heavy artillery! That's </span><span>gotta</span><span> be William's shot!" Carson's voice rang out with relief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone knew that William was a sharpshooter. When he took the shot, it was as good as over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stay covered. Don't take unnecessary risks. Those ambushers won't be around much longer," Carson shouted, his voice filled with confidence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The others, though battered, felt a surge of hope. As long as Marvin and William were with them, they believed victory was inevitable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carson saw an opportunity and quickly crawled over to one of his injured men. He grabbed him by the collar and dragged him behind a large boulder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man was badly injured, blood soaking through his clothes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carson didn't hesitate. He pulled out a first-aid kit, staunching the bleeding with quick, practiced hands. He applied a clotting agent to the wound, then wrapped it tightly in gauze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once he injected the soldier with morphine, Carson let out a deep breath, his heart still racing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He peeked over the boulder, eyes darting to the dark hills across from them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The enemy was out there, hidden in the shadows of the thick forest, their exact positions and numbers still a mystery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They </span><span>gotta</span><span> be safe," Carson murmured, his hands slick with sweat, his anxiety mounting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, another gunshot rang out in the night.</span></p><div class="pagination">
