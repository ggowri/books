  <div class="container"><p style="text-align:left;">Cesar surveyed the expressions of everyone in the room, a smug look on his face.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;It&#x27;s just Stephen. If he shows up, I can take him out with a single move! That 30-million-dollar bonus is as good as mine.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Karson didn&#x27;t see anything wrong with what he said, but Dariel and Travis appeared more displeased.</p><p style="text-align:left;">They were all seasoned experts, here for the money, and Cesar&#x27;s attitude suggested he wanted to hog it all for himself. Naturally, that didn&#x27;t sit well with them.</p><p style="text-align:left;">However, they couldn&#x27;t deny Cesar&#x27;s strength, and the last thing they wanted was to make an enemy out of him. So, they swallowed their dissatisfaction and kept quiet.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Alexander, on the other hand, sat back with an indifferent expression, sipping his coffee leisurely. He knew that if he unleashed his full strength, he could easily defeat Cesar in just three moves.</p><p style="text-align:left;">When Cesar noticed that Alexander didn&#x27;t even acknowledge him, he felt underappreciated. &quot;Listen, kid, out of respect for Mr. Chapman, I&#x27;m going to let you off the hook today. But when Stephen comes, don&#x27;t cause trouble or expect me to save you.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;We&#x27;ll see who ends up saving whom later,&quot; Alexander replied with a chuckle. Cesar&#x27;s arrogance had ignited a determination in Alexander to teach him a lesson.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Seeing Cesar&#x27;s temper flare, Karson quickly intervened, smiling as he said, &quot;Everyone, let&#x27;s not forget we have a powerful enemy to face. We need to stick together and not squabble among ourselves; we can&#x27;t give Stephen any openings.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Karson bowed to Cesar several times, persuading him to let the matter drop.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Though he had doubts about Alexander&#x27;s abilities, Karson recognized Alexander&#x27;s reputation for developing magic powder. Besides, he was recommended by his friend, Quentin. So, he needed to take Alexander seriously.</p><p style="text-align:left;">However, Karson felt more assured by the presence of Cesar, Travis, and Dariel when it came to dealing with Stephen.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Karson said confidently, &quot;Everyone, let&#x27;s take a moment to rest and conserve our energy. All the members of the Chapman family have already left, leaving just a handful of us in the castle, along with dozens of veteran security guards. They know their stuff and will be a big help.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Even if Stephen is the top expert from Sakra Society, he won&#x27;t have an easy time sneaking in without alerting those veterans.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Cesar shot a glance at Alexander, scoffing, &quot;Maybe Mr. Hawthorne should just hide. Staying here will only weigh us down. It wouldn&#x27;t be good if we can&#x27;t save him, and he ends up getting killed by Stephen.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Karson frowned, feeling that Cesar was being too disrespectful by constantly embarrassing Alexander.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Travis echoed, &quot;Mr. Hawthorne, as impressive as your magic powder skills are, you won&#x27;t stand a chance against Stephen. We&#x27;re just looking out for you; you should hide for now.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Dariel added loudly, &quot;Yes. We can&#x27;t afford to have any outsiders getting in our way. Stephen will exploit any distractions.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Karson&#x27;s expression darkened. With the three experts insisting on this, he felt compelled to take it seriously.</p><p style="text-align:left;">After a moment of hesitation, Karson smiled at Alexander. &quot;Mr. Hawthorne, why don&#x27;t you head inside? It&#x27;s safer there.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Alexander shot them a cold glance, a faint smile playing on his lips. &quot;Is this what you can do? Stephen hasn&#x27;t even arrived yet, and you&#x27;re already this scared? Come on.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Rest assured, if you find yourselves in danger, I&#x27;ll be there to save you!&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Cesar, Daniel, and Travis were stunned at first and then burst into laughter.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Travis pointed at Alexander, still laughing. &quot;You think you can save us? Kid, you&#x27;re delusional.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Dariel grinned maliciously, a hint of menace in his tone. &quot;This is absurd. Do you really think you&#x27;re that great? How can you make such a claim?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Cesar snorted, &quot;Since you&#x27;re so determined to stick around and meet your end, don&#x27;t expect us to come to your rescue if Stephen targets you!&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Karson felt caught in the middle. Glancing between the three experts and Alexander, he finally sighed, &quot;Mr. Hawthorne, just be careful! Don&#x27;t try to play the hero. Once Stephen arrives, Mr. Dussel and the others can handle him.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">The atmosphere turned tense, with everyone looking somewhat displeased.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Karson quickly instructed the staff to prepare fine wine and food, transforming the table into a lavish spread.</p><div class="pagination">
