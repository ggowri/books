They could discern the cards by touch and sound.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each </span><span>card's</span><span> back appeared identical, but there were subtle differences.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even the sound of a card rubbing against the table or the weight of a card varied slightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thus, when Finley and Jaylon inspected the cards, they already knew them like the back of their hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When the dealer pushed the cards to them, they already knew their own and their opponent's cards.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Of course, it wasn't always accurate. For instance, when facing another gambling master, both sides would employ various tactics to interfere with each other's intentions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But against Barry, who was practically a walking ATM, they could control the situation with absolute certainty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In just one hour, Barry had already lost 50 million dollars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every time Barry got a good hand, Finley and Jaylon would fold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And when Finley and Jaylon had good hands, Barry's cards would also be decent, leading to intense showdowns.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barry fumed about his losses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix was even more displeased. Barry was the one losing, but the money was his.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barry showed no sign of stopping.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hahaha, Barry, you're even worse than before. Playing with you is no fun at all," Finley laughed mockingly, deliberately playing with the chips in front of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jaylon fanned the flames. "Don't tease him. Look at his expression. He's probably out of money. After all, he lost so much last time. Being able to bring out tens of million this time is already his limit."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Pathetic."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They openly mocked Barry, stoking his anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barry, who thought highly of himself, couldn't stand such provocation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He slammed his hand on the table, shouting, "This is nothing. I have plenty of money. Today, I will win against you. Felix, go exchange 500 million in chips."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix was stunned, unhappily looking at Barry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diego glared at Felix.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feeling the pressure, Felix strode off to exchange the chips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a short while, he returned with two trays filled with chips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He placed the trays in front of Barry and said, "Mr. Morris, this is my last offer. If you lose it, I won't give you any more money."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What? You're so stingy." Barry glared at Felix.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Morris, you know the situation I'm in. The funds I can mobilize are limited," Felix said calmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although he wanted Barry and Alexander to destroy each other, he wouldn't use a large sum of money to fill Barry's bottomless pit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tsk, 500 million. It seems Barry still has some small power," Finley chuckled, his laughter filled with mockery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jaylon echoed, "I wonder how long he can last with this 500 million."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had accepted a mission to win all of Barry's money and then split it with the Kaylon, who would ensure their safety.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was a surefire deal, and Finley and Jaylon were excited.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Forget it, 500 million it is. Get out of my sight. You're affecting my luck," Barry said unhappily, waving his hand at Felix.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix sneered at him with disdain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The gambling resumed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Nancy and Alexander met again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As usual, Nancy stared coldly at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander could sense her displeasure.</span></p><div class="pagination">
