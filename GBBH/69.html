  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Billy, this magic powder is incredible! I want to place an order. Name your price!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Billy! I've had experts analyze its ingredients, and it's completely safe! It's not just harmless; it's actually good for your health! It's downright miraculous!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Seriously, I want as much of this magic powder as you can get!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Billy was practically bouncing off the walls with enthusiasm, his admiration for Alexander deepening with each passing moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This magic powder promised ultimate pleasure without any harmful side effects, which meant selling it was completely above board.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was a gold mine waiting to be tapped!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The potential profits were staggering. This was a surefire way to rake in cash!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Billy hurried over to Alexander, practically tripping over himself in his eagerness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Boss, the market response to the magic powder is phenomenal! Can we ensure a steady supply?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander, expecting this enthusiasm, nodded coolly. "As long as we have enough raw materials, I can guarantee the supply. But the price for you will have to double."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Billy's heart sank a little at the thought of higher costs, but he quickly reminded himself that there was still plenty of money to be made.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander leaned in, his tone serious. "Just remember, don't tell anyone that the magic powder comes from me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Absolutely, boss! You can count on me. I wouldn't spill the beans even under torture!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Billy nodded vigorously, eager to become the sole distributor.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Doing some quick calculations in his head, Billy realized that if he could dominate the entire Loscity market with the magic powder, he could be looking at profits in hundreds of millions of dollars each month.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Sure, most of it would go to Alexander, but he'd still net a cool few tens of millions of dollars for himself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Plus, the connections he'd make with influential figures through this venture would elevate his status in ways he'd never imagined.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander chuckled to himself, a sly grin spreading across his face. "Theodore thinks he can monopolize the market with his new product and form alliances with all the big players? He's dreaming!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Billy, you're digging the grave for Guzman. The Brilliant Group is bound to fall apart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Just remember, they'll be the first to come after you. Stay sharp and recruit more people, but don't waste money on dead weight."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Billy shivered at the thought, his resolve hardening. "People die for money, and birds die for food. Given this golden opportunity, I'm ready to take on the Brilliant Group!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Just so you know, I've got a military background. With enough cash, we can recruit lots of retired soldiers to help us out."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander nodded. "That's great. I'll assign you an assistant who knows the ins and outs of the Brilliant Group. Knowing your enemy is half the battle."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With a snap of his fingers, Betty strutted in, her confidence radiating as she walked like a model, her hips swaying.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You! Aren't you Ms. Rowe from the Brilliant Group?" Billy exclaimed, his jaw nearly dropping in shock.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Betty flashed a sultry smile. "I'm just like you now&mdash;one of the boss' subordinates. We're going to make a great team."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Billy was genuinely impressed. If Alexander could recruit high-ranking officials from the Brilliant Group, then the magic powder was bound to bring them down for good.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The thought of becoming a real power player like Guzman sent a thrill through him, and he felt his blood pumping with excitement.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander smiled knowingly, fully aware of Billy's ambitions.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He was the puppet master pulling the strings, and with Betty keeping an eye on him, everything was under control.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Once the magic powder gained traction, not only would Billy benefit, but the Saint Group would also emerge as the leading distributor, maximizing profits.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When the magic powder took the world by storm, the Saint Group's valuation wouldn't just double; it would skyrocket beyond imagination.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As evening fell, Alexander's phone buzzed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was Ava again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I heard Theodore is rallying most of the families in Loscity. Please, don't go to the dinner. It's too dangerous!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A warm feeling spread through Alexander's chest at her concern.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Don't worry, you know my skills. I'll ensure my own safety," Alexander assured confidently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">On the other end of the line, Ava was silent for a moment before she spoke resolutely, "Alright. I'll gather the team and be on standby. If anything goes wrong, I'll send people in to rescue you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander was deeply touched. With someone like Ava by his side, what more could he ask for?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After wrapping up the call with Ava, he got another call from Anne. She, too, urged him not to put himself at risk.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander brushed off her concerns. He told Anne to follow Ava's lead and keep people on standby outside if it made her feel better.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Anne sighed, thinking, "Mr. Hawthorne is no ordinary person, but he's just too full of himself!"</p><div class="pagination">
