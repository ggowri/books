  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander sat at the head of the table, with Cloe sitting next to him. Only then did the others dare to take their seats.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The upper management, who rarely saw Alexander, were excited yet nervous, even only daring to sit on the edge of their seats as if ready to stand up at any moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander asked, "What dishes did you order?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>William smiled and said, "Boss, they have a rule here. We can't order dishes. We eat whatever Mr. Clement prepares for us."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone else was stunned. Since they hadn't dined there before, they were surprised that a restaurant could have such an unreasonable rule.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmph," one executive couldn't help but scoff. "It's just a restaurant. No matter how good the food is, it can't be this unreasonable. This is Treasure Island. How dare that chef be so arrogant?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Others chimed in, "Exactly, Mr. Hawthorne is visiting, and this so-called Mr. Clement dares to disrespect us!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll call someone over right now to smash his restaurant." Even Cloe expressed her dissatisfaction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Not allowing guests to order is indeed excessive, especially since we are here to host Mr. Hawthorne."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Right, why does he have such an attitude?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Several executives were indignant, believing that Mr. Clement was deliberately making things difficult and prepared to call for the destruction of the restaurant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Alexander smiled and waved his hand, saying, "Forget it. Since we're here, let's see what his dishes are like first. If they're not good, we can still find trouble later."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing that Alexander had spoken, the others exchanged glances and fell silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But each of them had a determined expression, deciding that regardless of the taste of the food, they would claim it was bad. They were intent on smashing the restaurant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander maintained his smile. His cooking skills were quite decent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After becoming an Advanced Warrior, his perception abilities had vastly improved, even enhancing his culinary skills significantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The quality of a chef's cooking depended largely on their control over the cooking process and the selection of seasonings. The seasonings must balance salty and sweet while bringing out the food's deliciousness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's vision, taste, and touch, along with his control abilities, had reached levels far beyond ordinary people, which also improved his cooking skills.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Therefore, he was looking forward to tasting the culinary skills of this royal chef's descendant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Alexander didn't expect that after they sat down, they waited nearly an hour without seeing any dishes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Alexander's expression changed, as he felt that this restaurant was indeed taking advantage of its guests.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cloe slammed the table heavily, her tone icy as she said, "How dare a mere cook act recklessly in Treasure Island?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>William and Logan also wore stern expressions, feeling that the owner of this restaurant was digging their own grave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Several executives were delighted and immediately prepared to call their subordinates to come and smash the place to curry favor with Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sorry for the wait. We had to hold off because there was another table waiting for their guests," a staff member from the restaurant explained.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander coldly replied, "If they never arrive, will we never get to eat?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The server's face turned red, unsure how to respond.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The manager quickly interjected, "Dear guests, the dishes for both tables are prepared together. Therefore, the chef has to wait until the other table's guests are all present before starting to cook."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This infuriated Alexander, making him feel that the restaurant's owner was ridiculous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was ready to flip the table to teach the chef a lesson.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, a young man walked in with a smile, waving at Cloe. "Ms. Cloe Bryant, I apologize for arriving late."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Behind him were several young men and women, chattering incessantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing the young man, Cloe frowned and made an unhappy sound, then quietly said to Alexander, "That guy is from </span><span>Louvian</span><span>, the son of a wealthy businessman. His name is Alfred Bright."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfred noticed Cloe and Alexander being intimate and looked at Alexander with a hint of hostility.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The restaurant manager waved to the other servers. "Mr. Bright has arrived. We can start the meal."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfred didn't go to his own table but walked up to Cloe, extending his hand enthusiastically as he smiled, "Ms. Cloe Bryant, I didn't expect we'd have the chance to dine together today. I'm so happy!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
