  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Charlize could only manage a wry smile. She had thought their boss was a mild-mannered guy who needed their protection.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Little did she know that now it was Alexander who was protecting her. Even the Phantom Squad's commander didn't measure up to Alexander's skills.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Damn useless fools! A bunch of worthless idiots..." Sebastian seethed, his anger boiling over.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With a swift motion, Alexander flicked his foot, sending a baton skidding toward Sebastian. "You wanted to break my hands? Either pick up that baton and hit me, or break your own hands."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Sebastian's face turned a shade of red as he stuttered, "You little punk! Don't get cocky. The Brilliant Group has thousands of subordinates and countless experts. You're as good as dead!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander smirked, a hint of disdain in his eyes. "Don't say I didn't give you a chance. If you tell me Guzman's whereabouts, I'll not only spare you but also fix Theodore's hand. What do you say?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Alexander, you're dreaming! I'd rather die than betray Guzman. You'll just be his stepping stone to the Godfather position!" Sebastian roared defiantly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With a casual wave of his hand, Alexander said, "Since you're so loyal to Guzman, Charlize, why don't you help him see just how loyal he really is?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Charlize wasted no time. She grabbed the baton, kicked Sebastian to the ground, and pinned his right hand beneath her foot.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As she raised the baton high, ready to bring it crashing down, Sebastian yelled in desperation, "Don't you dare!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Touch a single hair on me, and I'll make you regret it for the rest of your life. The Brilliant Group won't let you off the hook, and Guzman will have your head!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With an icy calm, Alexander ordered, "Break one of his hands first."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Before the words had fully left his lips, Charlize brought the baton down with a resounding crack.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The sound of breaking bone echoed through the alley as Sebastian howled in agony, clutching his mangled hand, writhing like a wounded boar.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Alexander, I swear I'll make you pay for this! I'll skin you alive..." Sebastian spat, his voice laced with venom.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander chuckled lightly, his tone cold. "If you don't give me Guzman's exact location, you'll be dead in three days. You only have three days."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With that, he focused his Force, slapping his palm against Sebastian's forehead.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A sharp, needle-like Force pierced through Sebastian's skull, burrowing deep into his brain, waiting for the right moment to strike.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Get lost!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander kicked him away with ease.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Dazed and confused, Sebastian felt a flicker of hope as he realized Alexander had let him go.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He burst into laughter. "Alexander, I knew you were scared! You don't have the guts to kill me because I'm Sebastian!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But when Alexander approached him again, fear gripped Sebastian, and he turned tail, running for his life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His men, battered and bruised, helped each other stumble away in a chaotic retreat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Charlize was alarmed. "Boss, are we really just going to let them go? If we don't cut the weeds at the root, they'll just grow back! Let me chase after them and finish Sebastian off!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander smiled calmly, "Don't worry. He'll be back begging for mercy soon enough."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Charlize looked at him, bewildered by his confidence. She didn't know what to make of it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander gave her shoulder a reassuring pat. "Just wait and see. He'll come crawling back."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The lingering Force in Sebastian's mind would turn into a torment he couldn't endure. Alexander was certain that the pain would be unbearable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Not long after Sebastian left, the anger simmered within him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He gritted his teeth, already plotting to mobilize a stronger team to seek revenge on Alexander.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Suddenly, he clutched his head, groaning in pain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What the hell? My head hurts... Get me to a hospital, quick!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The group rushed to the hospital in a chaotic flurry.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Before long, Ava caught the wind of Sebastian, who was causing trouble, and hurried over to check on Alexander.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Alexander, are you okay?" Ava asked with genuine concern as she stepped through the door.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Rebecca followed closely behind, her expression cautious and puzzled as she scrutinized Charlize.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At that moment, Charlize was busy cleaning, dressed in a snug apron that hugged her curves.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The outfit accentuated her ample figure and slim waist, revealing long, graceful legs that gave off an enticing vibe reminiscent of a character from a popular video game.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander chuckled. "I'm fine, but it's Sebastian who's in trouble."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As she saw that Alexander was unharmed, Ava's attention shifted to Charlize.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What's going on here? Have you found yourself a maid to keep around? Hiding a pretty face, are we?"</p><div class="pagination">
