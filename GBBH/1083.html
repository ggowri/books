  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander let out a heavy sigh. "You've still got decades ahead of you. How are you planning to get through all that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma's </span><span>smile</span><span> was bitter. "No idea. </span><span>I don&rsquo;t have time to think about that now</span><span>. </span><span>My f</span><span>irst priority is </span><span>to save my husband</span><span> right now</span><span>."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, I get that."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander nodded, knowing all too well that every family had their own problems to solve, and sometimes, he just couldn't help, no matter how much he wanted to.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, Emma's voice shifted, taking on a seductive edge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander... when I met you, it stirred up some intense feelings. And I'm scared that once you partner with Silver Shield Security, you'll ditch us..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her meaning couldn't have been more obvious. She was hinting at something.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma's gaze grew more enticing by the second, like she was trying to reach right into Alexander's soul and pull his strings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll do anything, absolutely anything. I'll make you happy, please you in every way... </span><span>Please </span><span>help us out. That's all I'm asking!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She turned and threw herself into Alexander's arms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hold me, please," Emma pleaded, her eyes searching his face with desperate hope.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander remained silent, his hands instinctively finding their way to her waist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma pressed herself against him as if trying to melt into his very being, her body soft and warm against his chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Please," she whispered urgently, "hold me tighter."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander felt a wave of pity wash over him, mixed with a surge of desire that threatened to overwhelm his senses. Dark energy pulsed beneath the surface, amplifying everything he felt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he held himself back, knowing all too well what would happen if he gave in. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As more women entered his life and his power grew stronger, that dark energy within him would only become more dangerous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Until one day, when he'd lose control of this dark energy, letting it corrupt him completely, transforming him into a Corrupted Warrior.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma gazed up at Alexander with pleading eyes, looking utterly vulnerable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, Alexander drew in a deep breath before slowly opening his arms, gently pulling Emma into his embrace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her delicate frame melted against him, soft yet perfectly formed, her enticing perfume making it harder for him to keep his growing desire in check.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he managed to stay clear-headed, keeping himself under tight control.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma smiled, content. It had been three years since she'd felt the warmth of a man's embrace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And considering how Alexander had saved both her and her daughter, she couldn't help but feel more than just gratitude&mdash;she genuinely admired him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The room was so quiet one could hear a pin drop, filled only with the sound of their increasingly heavy breathing and racing heartbeats.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma had already reached for Alexander's zipper, her hand venturing beneath. "What the..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her eyes widened in shock, both intimidated and intrigued by what she discovered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander gently took her hand and slowly withdrew it, then gave her back a gentle pat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're tired. Get some rest," he said. "Don't worry. I'll bring your husband back safely."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without looking back, Alexander left the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma stood frozen, at a loss. Just moments ago, Alexander had clearly been affected, responding like any man would.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Why had he just walked away like that?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander exhaled heavily as he shut his bedroom door behind him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't that he couldn't feel the pull. Hell, he had more than enough women in his life already. But he wasn't about to let himself get lost in desire and end up another Corrupted Warrior.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When night fell, Alexander made his way to Frenzy Bar right on schedule.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment he pushed through the doors, he was hit with a wall of sensations&mdash;the sharp bite of liquor mixed with cigarette smoke, and music so loud it felt like a physical force against his eardrums.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laser lights sliced through the haze in every direction. Up on stage, a DJ was going </span><span>hard on the decks, surrounded by dancers moving like they were possessed by the beat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The dance floor was packed with bodies swaying to the beat, a sea of people moving as one.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Many scantily clad women with heavy makeup crowded around men, occasionally letting out wild shrieks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's eyes drifted to the corners, where people sprawled across chairs or slumped against walls, their faces frozen in expressions of pure bliss.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No question about it&mdash;they were all riding the magic powder high, lost in their own personal paradise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since magic powder hit the streets, it had completely decimated the drug market. The reason was&mdash;magic powder wouldn't wreck people's bodies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander chuckled. Frenzy Bar truly lived up to its name&mdash;a chaotic mix of people, a real snake pit. He wondered if the person who invited him here was </span><span>actually Jordan</span><span>, the chairman of Silver Shield Security.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey! </span><span>You</span><span> there!" A big guy muscled his way through the crowd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He gave Alexander an icy look and beckoned him over. "Come here, you absolute idiot. Ready to throw your life away over some girl, huh? Let's go&mdash;our chairman's been waiting for you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander just smirked and followed the guy's lead, trailing him to a VIP booth near the bar's stage.</span></p><div class="pagination">
