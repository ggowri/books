  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander sneered, "How shameless! You even want to blackmail our Ultimate Alliance!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Todd's face turned pale. Not only did he not get the money, but he was also slapped in the face. He couldn't bear it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Do you think I don't know what the Ultimate Alliance has done? How many people have died in the Blood Gang, the Cripples, and the Brilliant Group?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You have blood on your hands in your quest to dominate Loscity! If I tell anyone about this, you will all go to jail!" shouted Todd threateningly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander smiled even more happily and said to Betty, "Do you hear what he just said? Let the lawyer sue him tomorrow."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Todd was so angry that he had heart pain. He thought, "Alexander is simply unreasonable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When encountering such a thing, shouldn't the Ultimate Alliance pay a large sum of money as hush money?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He pointed at Alexander and cursed, "Don't be so complacent! My cousin will not forgive you. If you dare to defy the Dragon Gang, everything you have will be in vain."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Todd was like a greedy, poisonous snake with bared fangs, wanting to devour everything of the Ultimate Alliance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander couldn't help but laugh again. In this world where strength was respected, few people could threaten him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Todd actually threatened him in public.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander could easily kill Felix and Monica, so why would he care about Todd and the Dragon Gang?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Todd, this is extortion. Get ready to go to jail.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The Dragon Gang can't save you. If they dare to attack the Ultimate Alliance, I guarantee that the Dragon Gang will be destroyed, and no one in the Dragon Gang will see the sun tomorrow."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander's firm tone made Todd's expression even more terrible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Shut up! Alexander, you..." shouted Todd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But with another crisp sound, Alexander slapped him hard in the face again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Now, Todd's cheeks were both swollen, looking funny.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You! You dare to hit me. I'm calling the police!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Todd's eyes were full of fear and anger. He didn't expect Alexander to be so arrogant and would slap him in the face at any time, not respecting him at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Go away!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander kicked Todd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ouch!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Todd fell to the ground, holding his stomach in pain. His body bent into the shape of a shrimp.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander grabbed him by the collar and warned, "Remember, I can kill you easily! If you dare to make trouble again, I will kill you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Todd was so frightened that he wet his pants.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Go away. So shameful!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander threw him far away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Todd didn't dare to say a word and ran away quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His subordinates followed him in a panic as if a ferocious beast was chasing them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander and the others burst into laughter, feeling happy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Under Lamont's guidance, Alexander and Betty came to the office to rest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After serving coffee and snacks, Lamont left tactfully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone in the Ultimate Alliance knew that Betty was Alexander's woman, and many people were highly envious of Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander sat on the sofa with his legs apart. Betty took the initiative to kneel in front of Alexander, put her hand on his crotch, and kneaded it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She asked, "Mr. Hawthorne, I have always had a question. Why do we have to move to Treasure Island? It's inconvenient on the island, whether it is transporting raw materials or finished products."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander said calmly, "Because I have a bad feeling that a terrible disaster will happen in Loscity."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Betty was frightened, and even her hands froze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Will it be more terrible than the plague last time?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander recalled the terrifying appearance of the living dead, and he nodded with a gloomy face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Very likely!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Betty couldn't help shivering and said hesitantly, "Mr. Hawthorne, in addition to relocating the production line, do we need to purchase a large amount of daily necessities and transport them to the island?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander suddenly became excited. He thought, "How could I forget the simplest thing?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If the living dead really affects the world, magic powders and beauty ointments are not necessary. What is important is food, medicine, and weapons and ammunition."</span></p><div class="pagination">
