  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander returned to the bedroom from his study.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava lay on the bed, her elegant figure illuminated by the morning light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was simply stunning, and he found it hard to look away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Alexander climbed into bed and wrapped his arms around Ava, she suddenly pushed him away, her beautiful eyes filled with anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava grabbed his little dragon. Although she didn't use that much force, Alexander felt a slight pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't make any move but smiled bitterly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey, hey, hey, what are you doing in the morning? Are you crazy?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava glared at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're the crazy one! What did you, Rosalia, and Charlize do last night? Do you think I'm deaf? You all screamed so loudly... You are so shameless!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tears welled in her eyes, and Alexander felt a mix of amusement and helplessness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ava, you said you could accept it before, and besides, you weren't exactly satisfying me..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Humph!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She rolled her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If I couldn't accept it, I would have cut you off long ago! But why let me know? It just makes me sad."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feeling frustrated, Alexander repeatedly apologized.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm sorry! It was my fault. I won't let you know next time."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're just an asshole!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She pushed him onto the bed, furious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He grabbed her wrists, flipping her over to pin her down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let go of me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava struggled, her face turning red.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her pajamas were open because of her struggle, and her naked breasts rubbed against Alexander. She immediately felt a strange pleasure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey, do you want this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander playfully squeezed her bosom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She suddenly bit his hand, causing him to wince.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He refrained from using the Force in retaliation; he didn't want to hurt her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fortunately, Ava let him go, leaving two rows of shallow marks on his hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't bite me; you're not a puppy!" he said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He smacked her hard on the butt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Smack!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The pain made Ava at a loss.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When she finally calmed down, he sighed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Can you just listen to my explanation?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He explained how he had inherited James' powers, which could enhance his strength when he was with others, without revealing he was a Warrior.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Really!?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava looked astonished, never expecting such magic to exist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feeling a bit embarrassed, she realized she had misjudged him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander relaxed and pulled her close.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah... don't do that..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava protested, pushing him away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ashley will wake up soon, and you won't stop in an hour... No!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Alexander didn't let her go.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But you bit me, so you have to make it up!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander released the evil dragon and filled those sexy red lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmm!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She looked at him with sultry eyes, trying to keep up with his advances.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before she knew it, her mouth was sore, but Alexander still had no intention of ending. Ava became anxious and scolded him, "What kind of monster are you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, a voice came from the hallway.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dad, Ava, are you awake?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander quickly released her, giving her a playful pat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This isn't over; I'll get you tonight."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Seriously? You say that now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava retreated to the bathroom, blushing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander looked at her plump and pretty back and licked his lips. Ava was the most charming beauty among all the women he had.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Good morning, Dad!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ashley entered the room, and Alexander hugged her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ashley, you're so sweet! I'll make you breakfast. If you need anything, ask Ms. Purnell."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay! Ms. Purnell is the best! Hurry up with breakfast. I don't want to be late!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ashley danced around, eager for breakfast.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Ava admired her reflection in the mirror, her heart racing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander had never taken any safety measures. Would she get pregnant soon?</span></p><div class="pagination">
