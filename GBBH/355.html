  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was late at night when Alexander returned to his hotel room. Brittany, growing impatient, perked up at the sound of approaching footsteps.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's me!" Alexander called out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brittany opened the door with relief, throwing herself into his arms. "You're finally back. I was worried about you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Alexander unharmed, she relaxed. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He noticed her fresh scent and the warmth of her embrace, his heart racing. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wrapped in a simple white bath towel, Brittany appeared both shy and relieved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Desire sparked in Alexander as Brittany leaned in to kiss him deeply, her soft lips filling him with sweetness. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment seemed to stretch on, as if time had stopped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Alexander gently laid Brittany on the bed, she suddenly hesitated, her face turning pale. "What's wrong?" he asked softly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a pause, Brittany replied, "I have a scar from a childhood burn. My ex-boyfriend left me because of it. Does it bother you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander replied sincerely, "Not at all. Let me see it. Maybe I can help."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Really?" Brittany asked, surprised and hopeful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With trembling hands, she revealed the scar. Her body was beautiful, but the scar beneath her breast had always made her feel self-conscious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brittany blushed, whispering, "That's why I've never been with anyone."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander, focused on her well-being, gently touched the scar. "Burn scars can be tough, but I know a way to help."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brittany's eyes lit up with hope. "You really have a way?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander nodded, recalling a remedy from his studies. "Yes, I can help you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He gathered the necessary herbs, and with Brittany's help, they were delivered quickly. Alexander prepared the ointment with care, blending the herbs and magic powder into a soothing blue balm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is this really going to work?" Brittany asked, both eager and doubtful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander reassured her with a smile. "Trust me, this will help. It can reduce scars and improve skin."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brittany felt a wave of relief and gratitude. "Thank you, Alexander. I believe in you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She embraced him, filled with newfound confidence. Alexander, touched by her trust, gently reminded her, "Let's try the ointment first."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brittany nodded, grateful for his support and the chance to finally heal.</span></p><div class="pagination">
