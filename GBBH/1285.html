  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Sally's physical strength dramatically improved, their intimate moments became more intense and enduring.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To show her gratitude to Alexander, she went out of her way to please him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No matter what position or level of humiliation Alexander desired, she accepted it willingly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By the time they finished, it was already evening.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander got into the car and drove forward. A three-story house stood alone at the edge of a field, with no obstacles or signs of zombies around.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Having slept outdoors for several nights, Alexander decided to spend the night in the house.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sally was now capable of defending herself, so he wasn't worried about her safety, even if there were zombies or mutated beasts inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The small farmhouse looked at least twenty years old, with a white exterior that had turned yellow and was quite weathered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The cement ground in the courtyard was crisscrossed with long cracks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander kicked open the door and walked in, deliberately making a loud noise to draw out any lurking creatures.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The house was eerily quiet, with no sign of movement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander surveyed the area for a moment before stepping onto the first floor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, it's pretty dark in there. Might be dangerous," Sally warned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander just smiled. He hadn't told Sally about his enhanced senses or his ability to see through walls.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't that he didn't trust her; he was just used to keeping his cards close to his chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The room was pitch black and smelled musty, clearly uninhabited for a long time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The furniture was old, and the floor tiles were yellowed and discolored.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander circled the first floor, finding the kitchen and bathroom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The kitchen was barren, cleaner than the floor here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander then walked down the hallway to the backyard, where some firewood was stacked, and a chicken coop stood empty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Looks like the owner took the food and bailed. No one's here," Alexander said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They weren't short on food or water; they just needed a place to rest properly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sally lit the firewood and cooked some MREs, then heated up some roasted beef. The aroma filled the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After dinner, Sally found a large iron bucket and filled it with hot water, mixing it with cold water for a warm bath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was the first warm shower Alexander had in days, and he couldn't help but feel completely relaxed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't deny that having someone to take care of him made a huge difference.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get some sleep, but don't sleep too deeply tonight," Alexander said with a meaningful tone as they prepared to rest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sally froze for a moment, then nodded firmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was clear that Alexander had noticed something, but he was playing it cool, pretending he knew nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah! This is so comfortable. I haven't slept in a real bed in ages," Sally exclaimed, sprawling out on the large bed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though the mattress was a bit old, it was far more comfortable than sleeping on the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, the two of them drifted off to sleep, wrapped in each other's arms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By midnight, the room was filled with the soft snoring of both of them, seemingly sound asleep.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, a shadowy figure slipped into the room, gun in hand. Moving quietly, he approached the bed and pressed the barrel to Alexander's forehead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander opened his eyes calmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If the man pulled the trigger, Alexander was confident he could cut him in half before the man even twitched.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who the hell are you?" the man growled, his voice rough and menacing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We're just survivors passing through. I'd suggest you put the gun down, or no one will be able to save you," Alexander said matter-of-factly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Survivors, huh? Ha! I don't care who you are. This is my place, and you're going to pay for breaking in," the man snarled, his eyes lingering on Sally's curvaceous form, a glint of lust in his gaze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sally nestled closer to Alexander, her confidence in him unwavering.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite the gun, she felt no fear. Even Sally was sure she could take him down before he could pull the trigger.</span></p><div class="pagination">
