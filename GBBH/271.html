  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Schroder crossed his legs, sipping wine with a smug expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As long as I'm here, the position of Hansen family head is yours. But as for the family's income going forward..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Orion promptly assured him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry, General. Once I become the head of the Hansen family, I'll give you a third of all profits."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Schroder stared at him, displeased.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Only a third? If it weren't for the Red Umbrella Group's arrangements, I wouldn't even be working with you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How am I supposed to share with the Red Umbrella Group if you only give me a third?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gritting his teeth, Orion said, "Half! From now on, you'll get half of our profits."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmm, very good. I'm satisfied," Schroder nodded with approval.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the Hansen family's tens of billions in assets, annual profits wouldn't be less than a billion dollars, maybe even several billions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even after sharing half with the Red Umbrella Group, what he kept would still be astronomical.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Orion shot a glance at his son, Jonas, who quickly summoned two attractive women into the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"General, these two ladies are skilled in massage. You've traveled a long way to </span><span>Loscity</span><span>, so let them help you unwind."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two women, dressed scantily, snuggled up to Schroder, pressing their curvy bodies against him while pouting flirtatiously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Schroder's eyes lit up, and he smiled, praising Orion's arrangements.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"By the way, I heard Alexander and his ex-wife, Jane, have a daughter. Bring the Fairfax family here tonight. If Alexander refuses to hand over the formula, we can exemplify them!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Brilliant idea, General! I'll get right on it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Orion flattered the general while dragging his son out of the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, lewd sounds echoed from the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jonas frowned, saying, "Dad, isn't it too much for the general to demand half of our profits right off the bat?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Orion glanced cautiously at the closed door and whispered, "Shut up! Our priority now is to secure the family head position. That wretch Lara is scheming with Alexander and will compete with me. Without Schroder's help, we're in real danger."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jonas' face turned vicious as he said, "Hasn't the general already arranged for special forces? As soon as Alexander shows up, whether he hands over the formula or not, he's dead."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Orion sighed lightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's hope so. Alexander isn't an easy opponent."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By dusk, the city lights began to shine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Hansen family's luxurious seaside villa was bustling today.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not only had </span><span>Loscity's</span><span> elite gathered, but even dignitaries from nearby towns had arrived.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Ralph bedridden, Orion led the Hansen family to personally welcome the VIP guest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Schroder from Northern Command!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Schroder held a high rank, commanding tens of thousands of elite troops. He had a notorious love for women, jewelry, and gambling, earning him the nickname "The Playboy General."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Orion waved excitedly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The general will arrive soon. Make sure we maintain the Hansen family's decorum."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Hansen family members agreed eagerly, each adjusting their attire excitedly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If they could successfully collaborate with the general, the Hansen family members would certainly rise to the top, surpassing the Federer family members as </span><span>Loscity's</span><span> leading family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lara's face was pale with anger; as the rightful heir, she had been forced to the back row, deliberately attempting to humiliate her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmph! Just wait, Orion. Alexander will show you what it means to be left empty-handed."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Beep </span><span>beep</span><span>!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A series of honks rang out as a dozen black sedans sped toward them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the center was an extended bulletproof Lincoln, its black paint glistening under the lights.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone's eyes widened as they watched the imposing convoy, certain that Schroder was in the bulletproof Lincoln at the center.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though Schroder wasn't yet a general, the military was the strongest force, and a major general held immense power, enough to crush any faction in </span><span>Loscity</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lara felt anxious. Why hadn't Alexander arrived yet?</span></p><div class="pagination">
