  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander stepped in front of Mary, his gaze cold and unwavering as he faced the approaching men.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mary felt a surge of safety wash over her&mdash;something she hadn't experienced since her husband's tragic accident years ago.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mark, the leader of the group, waved his hand in anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Take him down! Bring Mary back!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Several burly men charged at Alexander like wolves hungry for prey.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a flash, Alexander struck out, his fists connecting with the chests of two attackers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They flew backward, howling in pain as a few of their ribs cracked under the force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mark's expression shifted from surprise to fury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, you've got some skills, huh? Everyone, get him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The remaining thugs rushed at Alexander, while Mark stealthily circled around, aiming to catch him off guard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Alexander, with Mary safely in his grasp, moved fluidly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His right hand launched a flurry of punches&mdash;hooks, jabs, slaps, and thrusts&mdash;taking down enemies one after another with remarkable ease.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sounds of agony, cracking bones, and blood splattering filled the air, creating a chaotic symphony of violence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Die!" Mark shouted, finally lunging at Alexander with a knife.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Alexander seemed to have eyes in the back of his head; without turning, he delivered a swift kick that landed squarely in Mark's groin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Ahhh</span><span>!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mark crumpled to the ground, clutching his stomach and wailing in despair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In mere moments, Mark and his gang lay scattered on the ground, all of them defeated and broken.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Impressive!" Mary </span><span>exclaimed,</span><span> her eyes wide with astonishment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had known Alexander was capable, but witnessing his prowess firsthand left her speechless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, tell me. Who sent you?" Alexander said, looking down at Mark with authority.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mark gritted his teeth, refusing to speak, with a cruel smile creeping onto his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said, "You've crossed the wrong people!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a swift motion, Alexander stepped on Mark's right hand, applying relentless pressure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sound of cracking bones echoed, but Mark remained silent, determined not to reveal his employer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander said with a smirk, "Got a tough guy here. Let's see how tough you are with this."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He aimed for Mark's other hand, but Mary tugged on his arm, her eyes darting to the growing crowd of onlookers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There are too many people around. Let's get out of here and avoid any more trouble. I have plenty of enemies myself, and I can't keep track of them all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you for saving my mom and protecting me," she said, her gaze filled with gratitude and admiration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was hard to believe that such a perfect man existed&mdash;someone who was loyal, mysterious, and incredibly strong.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A wave of jealousy washed over her as Mary thought about Ava, wishing she could be as lucky.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they turned to leave, Mark's voice cut through the air, laced with venom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You think this is over? I'll remember you, and I'll make you pay for this!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander didn't even glance back, leading Mary to the car and driving away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ignoring Mark was the ultimate insult, and it sent the man into a rage, causing him to spit out another mouthful of blood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While driving, Mary glanced at Alexander, her expression turning serious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm really sorry for dragging you into this mess."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a light laugh, Alexander waved his hand dismissively.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry about it. Just don't take it the wrong way, but when you pinched me earlier, it kind of got me worked up. I promise I won't let it happen again."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mary's expression shifted instantly, her eyes narrowing in annoyance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What do you mean by apologizing? Are you making fun of me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander blinked, momentarily confused by her reaction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, a large truck screeched out from a side road, startling Mary. She hit the brakes hard, swerving the steering wheel to regain control.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had forgotten to buckle her seatbelt, so the force of the abrupt stop sent her tumbling toward Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quick on his feet, he caught her just in time, his hand inadvertently pressing against her soft and ample breast.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The car finally came to a halt by the roadside. Mary, still shaken, found herself plastered against Alexander, her heart racing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't help but lick his lips, finding it hard to resist the temptation to give her a gentle squeeze. They were lush and impossibly soft, a handful barely managing to cover them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What was that you said earlier? Now you're touching me, are you trying to make fun of me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mary looked at him with mock annoyance and wrapped her arms around Alexander to kiss him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I really didn't mean to... I'm so sorry..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Alexander could finish his sentence, Mary closed the distance between them, pressing her soft, red lips firmly against his.</span></p><div class="pagination">
