  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His expression twisted with rage as he glared at Gavin and the others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Gentlemen, I ask for your understanding. If you give me this opportunity, I will be deeply grateful. This grave will definitely be dug up today!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gavin remained stoic, letting out a disdainful snort.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The white-haired elders standing beside him, however, were infuriated. Axel's daring to be disrespectful in public was practically a death wish.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They were determined to support Alexander today because he had generously shared half the profits from the magic powder deal with them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, money moves mountains!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gavin said calmly, "Alex, do whatever you need to. We'll all support you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With just one simple sentence, Oliver and his men's morale surged.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander took a deep breath, suppressing his rage. It had been a long time since he had felt this furious, not since becoming a Warrior.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If you bow in front of the grave and apologize, I might spare your lives. But since the Vance family is so obstinate, don't blame me for what happens next."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With that, Alexander waved his hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In an instant, a dozen of the Vance family's bodyguards collapsed, each taken down with a precise shot to the head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before anyone could react, another wave of bodyguards fell into pools of blood. By now, every bodyguard standing beside Asher and Axel had been sniped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Axel quickly waved his hand, shouting, "Kill him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>One of the white-haired elders next to Gavin bellowed, "Who dares move? I'll see you court-martialed!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"It's Mr. Ford Vito!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The more than one hundred soldiers from the Vance family froze in shock. Ford was a general, the supreme commander of the military.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Shoot! Fire!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Axel shouted angrily, but none of the soldiers obeyed his command.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>While the Vance family had produced generals in the past, the highest-ranking officer they currently had was only a lieutenant general&mdash;nowhere near the status of Ford.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Instead of firing, the soldiers began retreating, putting as much distance as possible between themselves and the conflict.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Axel was so furious that his vision blurred, and he nearly fainted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander's lips curled into a mocking smile as he waved his hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A group of men in black suits appeared, marching in precise formation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Each of them had a solemn expression and carried a bouquet of chrysanthemums.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Their movements were synchronized, exuding an aura of professionalism and menace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Asher's face turned pale with fear. As someone with a sharp eye, he could immediately tell these men were no ordinary individuals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They had all experienced battle and bloodshed, and their presence radiated lethal intent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "These are members of the Ultimate Alliance. How could Alexander, a supposed gang leader, command such a formidable force?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Cold sweat soaked Asher's palms and feet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ryder and his dozen men were even more terrified. Their faces drained of color, and they trembled uncontrollably.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They all hid far away like sheep, confronted by a pack of wolves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At the head of the formation, Augusta approached the grave, gently placing his bouquet in front of the tombstone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The rest of the black-clad men followed suit, one by one, each laying their chrysanthemums in an orderly fashion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Bunches of chrysanthemums surrounded the tombstone and the cemetery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon, the entire grave was surrounded by chrysanthemums, their sweet fragrance wafting through the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Such a grand memorial service was typically reserved for the passing of truly influential figures, yet here it was before a humble grave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this time, Alexander began walking toward Asher.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His footsteps echoed like heavy blows pounding Asher's heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Asher, Axel. Bow and apologize!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander roared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At the same time, countless men in black shouted in unison, "Bow! Apologize!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The deafening command shook Axel and Asher to their core, leaving them trembling uncontrollably.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ryder and his men were so frightened they collapsed to the ground, their courage shattered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The scene was suffocating, brimming with murderous intent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Bow!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander ordered again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Swish!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Countless gun barrels turned toward Axel and Asher.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The two men, their faces livid, were on the verge of spitting blood. They were among Kingsdon's elite, yet here in Loscity, they were being humiliated by a gang leader.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You won't bow? Do you want to die?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander's voice was ice-cold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Asher's face turned an ugly shade of purple as he trembled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Grinding his teeth, he tried to stand firm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He said, "Alexander, stop trying to scare me! Mr. Gavin Lawson and others are watching. Would you really dare kill us in front of them?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Besides, West Cemetery belongs to the Vance family now. I'll dig up this grave no matter what!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
