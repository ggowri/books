  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With his brothers dead, Casper felt it would be worth it if he could kill more of the enemies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Damn it!" Alexander became furious, and his smile vanished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His Force instantly went berserk. With a loud boom, the ground split open, creating a deep crater.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Under the immense recoil force, Alexander instantly rushed to Casper's front and once again applied the Force Confinement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Oh, no!" Casper's face drastically changed. His body seemed to be frozen, making it extremely difficult for him to move even a little.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, time seemed to have completely stopped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Like a taut piece of paper being punctured, the Lightsaber pierced through Casper's left chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"How... how did you manage to do that?" Casper, in disbelief, slowly lowered his head to look at where his left chest was supposed to be, only to find a void; his heart was gone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He crashed heavily to the ground. His strong physical condition kept him from dying immediately. Instead, he was gasping for breath in large gulps.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Brothers, I'm sorry... I couldn't avenge you. We will be reunited soon..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Casper's eyes were wide open, his gaze unyielding even in death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Your leader is dead. Those who surrender will be spared; those who resist will die!" Alexander's powerful voice reached everyone's ears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was dead silent; neither Augusta and others nor the members of the Dragon Gang had yet recovered from the intense battle that had just taken place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander's display of power was so overwhelming that it was almost unbearable for them to accept, but this was the reality.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Aidan, Casper, and Kermit were powerless to resist and were killed by Alexander alone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Surrender, and you shall not be killed!" Coming back to reality, Augusta waved his hand, leading his men to charge at the enemy like fierce tigers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although both sides had a thousand people, one-third of the Dragon Gang had already been eliminated by Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The surviving members of the Dragon Gang were now terrified and lost their will to fight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>On Augusta's side, morale was high, with strong fighters like Marvin and Logan leading the charge, unstoppable in their advance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Some still tried to make a last stand with howitzers and heavy machine guns, but those few stubborn people were ripped in half by Augusta, their flesh and blood flying everywhere, which instantly broke the spirits of the remaining men.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I surrender! Don't kill me, don't kill me..." one man said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Don't kill me! I surrender!" another man said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Dragon Gang's forces instantly crumbled, and they all knelt down in unison to surrender and beg for mercy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>An hour later, Alexander and his subordinates were having a meeting in the newly set up tent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Augusta reported joyfully, "Sir, our gains this time are quite substantial. We seized twenty howitzers, fifty heavy machine guns, three thousand M16 rifles, ten sets of shoulder-launched anti-aircraft missiles, thirty sets of anti-tank missiles... and also two million rounds of ammunition, two power generator units, one thousand tons of diesel fuel, and one hundred thousand rations of military food..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It took him a long while to finish the list of captured equipment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marvin rubbed his big bald head and said, "The Dragon Gang was so fucking nice, giving us so many things."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even the usually reticent Logan couldn't help but laugh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Not just the equipment, they also brought in a batch of construction materials. We can completely set up the initial defenses for Devil Island."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander laughed happily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He said, "The Dragon Gang really took a big loss this time. We had no weapons at first, but the enemy delivered them to us."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Augusta suddenly thought of something and hurriedly said, "By the way, Sir, I have interrogated the prisoners and confirmed that the Dragon Gang has reclaimed quite a bit of iridium, but it's unclear how much they have in storage."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"That's great!" Alexander clapped his hands excitedly; the gains from this time were indeed unexpectedly large.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If he could gather enough iridium, it wouldn't take long for him to upgrade his Lightsaber.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A level-two lightsaber was already very powerful, capable of cutting through a combat armor with defenses no less than that of a tank in a single strike.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If Alexander were to obtain the level-three lightsaber, he could hardly imagine how powerful it would be.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Augusta said with pity, "Sir, the three pieces of combat armor are severely damaged and can no longer be used. However, they still hold great research value, so I've already arranged for them to be sent back to Treasure Island immediately."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He added, "Our own research team has already been assembled, and we have obtained the design blueprints for the first-generation combat armor from Mr. Patterson. We should see significant progress very soon."</span></p><div class="pagination">
