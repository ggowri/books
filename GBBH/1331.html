  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander wasn't in any rush to cash in his martial virtue points. He could always make his offering after reaching level-five warrior status. For now, it was too early&mdash;he still needed his Muscle-Tendon Classic technique to make a name for himself in the Outer Court.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He headed downstairs, noting that Aldric had already left. After giving a respectful bow to Trevor, who was deep in meditation, Alexander left the Manual House and made a beeline for the neighboring Treasure House.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time around, Alexander didn't bat an eye at the empty entrance hall. He'd been here before. He pulled out his silver token, which shot out a beam of white light. When the doorway materialized, he walked right through.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Treasure House's main hall dwarfed the one in the Manual House. Elegant palace lamps studded the jade-colored walls, while the floor was laid with smooth stone tiles. The whole place had this amazing old-school vibe that just worked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just like the other building, there was a couch made of precious wood near the entrance, complete with a yellow cushion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A middle-aged saint was sprawled across it. The guy was quite a sight&mdash;a broad forehead, thick eyebrows, and a wide mouth. His eyes crackled with energy, and he had these massive hands and feet. The dude was absolutely jacked, with muscles that looked like a beast. Alexander could practically feel the raw power radiating off him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was rocking a crimson robe and black shoes, half-lying there like he didn't have a care in the world. Between yawns, he looked totally zen, just vibing in his own space.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander hustled over to pay his respects. "Excuse me, but who might you be?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The saint stretched lazily. "Greysen Irvine of the Dominion Church's Hina Sect."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey, Mr. Irvine! I'm Alexander; I just got accepted into the Outer Court. Here to pick up my welcome package from the Treasure House," Alexander called out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Greysen handed him a small booklet, his eyes half-closed, before strolling away without another word.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Typical," Alexander muttered under his breath as he glanced down at the booklet in his hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Treasure Registry&mdash;exactly what he'd expected.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>According to the guide, the second floor of the Treasure House was dedicated to weapons. New disciples could select one weapon from the wood rack, which was basically the starter gear section.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The fancy stuff was on the higher-end racks. That would set him back 100 thousand silver coins and 10 thousand martial virtue points.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The rosewood rack was even more exclusive&mdash;weapons there cost 10 thousand gold coins and 100 thousand martial virtue points.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The third floor housed all the armor and protective gear. Newbies got one free pick from the basic wooden rack. Items on the boxwood rack went for 50 thousand silver coins and five thousand martial virtue points each.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The rosewood section was predictably steep&mdash;10 thousand gold coins and 50 thousand martial virtue points per piece.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And the fourth floor was strictly VIP&mdash;inner disciples only.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander gave Greysen a quick bow before heading upstairs. The second floor was packed wall-to-wall with weapon racks&mdash;basic wooden near the entrance, boxwood in the middle, and the most precious rosewood racks tucked away in the back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Alexander walked through the collection, his jaw nearly dropped. Even the weapons on the basic wooden racks were incredible, their silver surfaces gleaming with razor-sharp edges. He couldn't resist testing out a sword from the premium wood section. The blade sang through the air like a dragon's roar, its cold light sharp enough to split a hair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wanted to check out the rosewood section, but those top-tier weapons were sealed away in a small room. There was this waist-token-shaped alcove carved into the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he tried placing his silver token in the slot, nothing happened. His martial virtue points probably weren't high enough yet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander sighed and walked over to the basic wooden weapons rack. A quick glance showed him an array of weapons.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He picked up a dark iron staff, testing its weight. It was perfect for when he hit level-three warrior&mdash;a bit heavy now, but he'd grow into it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The staff was pitch black. It wasn't flashy at all, which was exactly what he wanted. That dark color would give him an edge in nighttime matches.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Heading up to the third floor, Alexander made a beeline for the premium armor section.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Armor? Nah, not going into battle right now," he thought. Protective gear would stick out like a sore thumb. It was definitely not what he needed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After what felt like forever searching through the rows of basic wooden racks, Alexander finally spotted the perfect defensive wear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A gold-threaded robe," he mused, checking its stats. "Just over eight and a half ounces, woven with gold, silver, brass, and refined iron threads. Strong enough to block attacks from level-three warriors and high-grade weapons. Perfect&mdash;lightweight, works as an undergarment, and totally subtle. No one would guess I'm wearing armor."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With his weapon and protective gear picked out, Alexander decided to skip browsing the premium wood and rosewood racks. Without any martial virtue points or coins to spend, why torture himself? He headed straight back to the main hall, said his goodbyes to Greysen, and made his way to the Outer Court residences.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The lay disciples' quarters were set up around the edge of the Outer Court, with everyone getting their own private room. Alexander glanced at the silver token hanging from his belt&mdash;number 608. Following the numbering system, he quickly tracked down his new place in the Outer Court.</span></p><div class="pagination">
