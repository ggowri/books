  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By the time Cole's team chased after them, the sports car had already disappeared into the dark night.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne, what should we do now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All eyes turned to Alexander with expressions of frustration. They'd underestimated the situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander looked calm, his intense gaze piercing through the night.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What should we do? They won't escape my grasp in the end!" he replied with unwavering confidence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With his current power, he feared no one. </span><span>So</span><span> what if the Morris family were stronger than the Red Umbrella Group? They weren't invincible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the car, Felix gritted his teeth and said, "Why is Alexander here?! That young guy chasing you is Alexander."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix recognized Alexander instantly; he was the enemy Felix had been dying to confront. Even if Alexander were just ashes, he'd still recognize him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That guy's Alexander?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barry's face went pale; he'd once confidently agreed to help Felix go against Alexander. What a death wish!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What about Diego?" Felix asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diego... if it weren't for him, I wouldn't have made it out... it was a trap!" Barry admitted, looking utterly defeated, a far cry from his former arrogance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barry was no longer the high-spirited man he used to be, much less proud. He looked like a terrified stray dog.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander's as crafty as they come. He's ruthless and cunning. He was probably onto us all along. Those guys, Finley and Jaylon, were his plants," Felix said, snapping him to reality.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn Alexander!" Barry growled, clenching his fists.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I swear, I'll make him wish he were dead."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix glanced over at him, a strange glint flickering in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His grip on the steering wheel trembled slightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Phew!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix took a deep breath, tamping down his mixed emotions, and said calmly to Barry, "I'm pulling over to take a leak."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright," Barry replied without suspicion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix parked the car on the roadside and went into the bushes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barry walked over, cursing Alexander under his breath as he relieved himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Felix positioned himself right behind Barry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Something glinted in Felix's right hand as he leaned in close to Barry's ear with a sly grin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How long would it take to die if you got stung by a killer bee?" he whispered with chilling menace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His tone dripped with lethal intent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barry jolted in shock, feeling a sharp pain in his side that nearly made him black out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He turned in horror to see a black killer bee falling to the ground beside him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn you, Felix! How dare you betray me?" Barry yelled, trying to fight back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But his vision blurred as a wave of weakness overtook him, draining his strength like the tide pulling back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You were destined to be my fuel, and Hell is waiting for you. Ha </span><span>ha</span><span> ha..." Felix laughed wildly, his voice thick with satisfaction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He pulled out a red syringe, plunged it into his arm, and injected the entire dose.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barry asked in terror, "W-What is that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix smirked and didn't hold back, explaining with a chuckle, "In a moment, you'll feel no pain. This is the latest extraction serum developed by the Red Umbrella Group. It refines a person's most essential qualities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Which means you're going to become my nourishment, helping me advance to a level-three metahuman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Plus, I'll gain your speed abilities. </span><span>So</span><span> I'll have speed, strength, fire, and freezing powers."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He went on, speaking with eager excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thud!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barry collapsed to the ground like a felled tree.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His body started to dissolve rapidly, like ice melting in the summer sun, soon reduced </span><span>to a few drops of red liquid dripping onto the leaves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix eagerly cupped the leaves, raised them to his mouth, and swallowed the red liquid.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instantly, a surge of power, like a searing warmth, flooded through his body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix felt a snap in his mind, as if some restraint had been shattered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Whoosh!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His figure vanished, only to reappear dozens of meters away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ha </span><span>ha</span><span> </span><span>ha</span><span>! I've gained speed abilities and become a level-three metahuman!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix's power had surged, and he was filled with uncontrollable excitement.</span></p><div class="pagination">
