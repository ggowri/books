  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Have you found out anything about that old man's background? He won billions from us last time. Why is he back today?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Norma turned and asked seriously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"W-well... we investigated, but found nothing..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The subordinate lowered his head, trembling slightly, unsure of what to say.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Find out immediately who's behind this! If you can't, I'll have you all thrown into the sea to feed the fish!" Norma shouted, fury blazing in her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Norma was seething, her presence radiating menace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone paled, knowing Norma meant what she said. She was ruthless and unforgiving.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If they stayed silent, they wouldn't just face dire consequences themselves but might also endanger their families.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Finally, someone stepped forward, stammering, "Boss, I... I know a bit. This man is Benjamin... apparently, he was invited by Mr. Walsh. Of course, this is just my guess..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Norma's face turned grim. She hadn't expected Sean to make the first move. She had underestimated him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ha, Sean, you've got some nerve to come after me! Do you think I'm that easy to crush?" Norma spat out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Norma's full figure shook with anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Benjamin ranked second globally in gambling. He's only ever lost to the top. We're in serious trouble now!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Did anyone talk to him? Maybe we could offer him money to leave and never come back."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Facing her question, the subordinate stuttered, "B-boss, we already tried talking to him. He refused our money and said he intends to win it all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Looks like that old man isn't planning on leaving today. He wants to push us to the brink."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The surveillance room fell silent. Everyone stared at Norma.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They all knew that Sean and Norma were now officially at odds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If Norma couldn't turn the tide, she'd lose control of the casino and, eventually, her position as head of the Dragon Gang.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At that point, Norma would be left with nowhere to run.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>For the rest of them, as members of the Dragon Gang, even if Sean took power, he wouldn't kill them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, they weren't panicking; in fact, they seemed mildly entertained.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Benjamin, ranked second in global gambling!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Norma's expression grew colder. Though she clenched her jaw tightly, she couldn't think of a solution.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>On Benjamin's table, more than two billion in chips were stacked high, an astonishing sight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Just as Norma was at her wit's end, Alexander suddenly laughed and said,</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Honestly, I think Benjamin's skills are overrated. I don't see what's so great about him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing Alexander's dismissive remark, Norma rolled her eyes and said irritably, "You don't understand gambling, so of course, you wouldn't know how dangerous he is. He won two billion from me in just an hour. At this rate, in three days..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Norma didn't finish her sentence. Her brows knitted, and her teeth clenched audibly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her mesmerizing eyes gleamed with intense hostility.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If it came to it, she'd have to sacrifice the casino's reputation and have her men take the old man out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Sean would blame her, but it was better than outright losing control of the casino.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But it would be a Pyrrhic victory. Everyone in the Dragon Gang would see she wasn't a match for Sean.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>By then, her position as the leader would be completely unstable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Boss, I suggest we have him taken out!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The old man's asking for it. It's not our fault. Sure, the casino's rating will drop, and our global reputation will take a hit, but it's better than letting him keep winning."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The suggestion came from Norma's trusted aide, who was waiting for her approval.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Norma said nothing, her brows slightly furrowed as she wrestled with her dilemma.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander suddenly spoke up, "I can take care of Benjamin for you, but you have to agree to one condition."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Immediately, everyone's eyes turned to Alexander, filled with surprise, doubt, and a mix of emotions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne, are you serious? What's your condition?" Norma asked, excitement flickering in her gaze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Norma became excited and looked at Alexander excitedly.</span></p><div class="pagination">
