  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Patrick nodded, stared at Alexander with resentful eyes and </span><span>said</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, you have repeatedly hurt the people of our city. I will never forgive you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander couldn't help laughing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Patrick said, "Why are you laughing? I'll kill you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A burly man rushed out from behind Patrick. He looked like aggressive and impulsive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He rushed towards Alexander, raised his fists high, and hit Alexander's temples with his fists.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His fists were covered with thick calluses, and his punches were very ferocious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The whistling wind from the fists even lifted Alexander's hair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The City of Sorcery had a large number of wizards and masters who had practiced fighting skills.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander faced the fierce attack calmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even until the fists reached in front of him, he still stood there motionless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The strong man was overjoyed and thought Alexander was scared silly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They all knew that Clay was Patrick's illegitimate son. Otherwise, Patrick, as the person in charge of the City of Sorcery in Kingsdon, would not have mobilized so many people to seek revenge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The strong man thought he had his chance to make it big. As long as he helped Clay to get revenge, he would be valued.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite the fists approaching, Alexander still stood with his hands behind his back, motionless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander stared at the strong man and ordered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kneel down!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander raised the Force to the limit and used his All-seeing Eyes to control the Force. He intimidated the man with just a glance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man who was originally so aggressive now had a blank mind and felt dizzy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kneel down! Did you hear me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander shouted harshly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man shivered and felt thunder ringing in his ears, which made him feel weak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And he knelt straight down in front of Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's face was dull. His eyes were lifeless, and there was no expression at all on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly the whole place was in silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both Clay and Patrick were dumbfounded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They didn't know what Alexander did. He didn't dodge or take action. It was very strange.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What are you doing? Get up!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Patrick roared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the man seemed not to have heard him. Instead, he prostrated himself at Alexander's feet even more respectfully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone was stunned. Many people said that the witchcraft in City of Sorcery was very weird, but they found that Alexander's was much weirder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Patrick's heartbeat quickened. And he regretted that he had come to Alexander so impulsively.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clay slumped in a wheelchair. His face pale.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What Alexander did was beyond Clay's understanding and could only be described with words like terrible, weird, and terrifying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, Patrick's eyes lit up, and he said angrily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It turns out that you are a metahuman who is good at hypnosis!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander couldn't help laughing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You know metahumans?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Patrick snorted angrily but did not answer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Others heard the word "metahuman" and look horrified. What they fear was the unknown.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for the metahumans who are good at hypnosis, they were powerful and confident. They thought they were fine as long as they didn't look Alexander in the eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Patrick waved his hand. And a group of people surrounded Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What did you do to Clay? Tell me the truth, or I won't let you go, and neither will the City of Sorcery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Not only you, but also your family. We won't let any of them go!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander got angry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander couldn't stand the threat to his family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said, "I don't believe that. The City of Sorcery wants Ancestral Witch's Cane and Spirit Bead Bracelet, right? Come and get them if you have the guts."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finished speaking, Alexander kicked the kneeling man away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man vomited blood in mid-air, then fell heavily to the ground, motionless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You dare to kill someone in front of me! You've gone too far!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Patrick was so angry that he was shaking all over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said, "Alexander, I have never met an opponent since I became a wizard. Today, I </span><span>will tear you to pieces and eat you in public!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander laughed. "Oh really?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Patrick was so angry that he almost vomited blood.</span></p><div class="pagination">
