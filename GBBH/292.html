  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The kidnappers weren't just ordinary criminals; they were seasoned soldiers who had seen the worst of battlefields. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Melin approached the back door, she heard screams from inside and ducked into the dense bushes, using her binoculars to peer inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was perched in a large tree, hidden by the thick foliage. From his vantage point, he spotted Melin. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her uniform and gear marked her as a police officer. Her actions seemed reckless, but he admired her bravery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The abandoned factory was filthy, covered in thick dust. Members of the Fairfax family were tied to concrete pillars, with seven or eight men in black patrolling with assault rifles. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosen was punishing a young man, Dexter Fairfax, whom Alexander recognized. Dexter had given him dirty looks before, and now Rosen was whipping him mercilessly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nearby, Frank was tied up separately, seething with rage.</span><span> </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come on, if you're so tough, beat me instead! Bullying them isn't a skill," Frank shouted.</span><span> </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You old fool, you're almost dead. I'm not wasting my energy on you," Rosen </span><span>laughed, striking Dexter again. Dexter's cries echoed through the factory.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Frank trembled with anger, powerless to help. Meanwhile, Alexander moved silently to the factory roof. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Two guards were stationed there, heavily armed, but they were no match for him. He swiftly neutralized them, donned a guard's hat, and took a weapon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From his new position, he noticed Melin sneaking along the wall. She crouched under a window, awkwardly sticking out as she used her phone to capture images inside. Alexander couldn't help but smile at her daring. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without his intervention, she might have been caught by the roof guards.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melin was thrilled to have recorded Rosen's brutality. This evidence would force Oliver to act, and it could make headlines, exposing the crimes of kidnapping and beating over 30 people. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her determination to bring criminals to justice was unwavering.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Melin had underestimated Schroder's influence. Her presence was already detected by another hidden guard. She put away her phone, checked her gun's magazine, and attempted to call for backup.</span><span> </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is anyone there? Please respond," she whispered into her radio. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the signal was weak, and no reply came. Frustrated and uneasy, Melin felt a bad premonition, but her determination drove her forward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She planned to take down the leaders first, hoping to capture Rosen and free the others. If the Fairfax members could arm themselves, they might stand a chance. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But this was wishful thinking. Even with weapons, they were unlikely to fight back against Rosen's battle-hardened men.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unbeknownst to her, two armed guards had quietly trailed her, waiting for an opportunity to capture her. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melin's athletic training had given her a fit physique, and her uniform accentuated her curves. The guards watched her with interest, struggling to stay focused on their task.</span></p><div class="pagination">
