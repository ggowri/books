  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander laughed and said, "It's just my hobby, but it hasn't produced any results."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>John nodded and said, "Having a hobby is a good thing, and it's not a bad habit."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't take it seriously, thinking that Alexander was just doing this purely as a hobby and he couldn't have any research results.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, there were all kinds of people in the world. Some liked prostitution and gambling, some liked racing and picking up girls, some liked fitness and self-discipline, and some liked playing games and experiencing virtual life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now Alexander liked scientific research. It was normal to have hobbies. This was what a normal person did.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry, Alexander. After I report this to the chairman, I will make the official appointment within three days at most."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>John instructed Robert, "Arrange a place for Edison to stay. It must be a five-star hotel. Here is my contact information. If you have any questions in the future, please contact me directly!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you, Mr. Butler."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander exchanged contact information with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After John left, Alexander casually asked Robert some questions, all about Treasure Island.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although it did not involve any secrets, it covered all aspects of Treasure Island.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Robert didn't think much about it. After all, Alexander would soon be the security chief and would stay on the island for a long time, so it was normal for him to ask about the situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only when it came to some very sensitive secrets, Robert started to hesitate and refuse to speak clearly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For example, when Alexander asked about the cooperation between the Red Umbrella Group and the Brilliant Group and the relationship between the two chairmen, Robert did not say a word.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, Alexander had just arrived on the island and his loyalty had not been tested.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But in a short period, Alexander had a better understanding of Treasure Island.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It turns out that the Brilliant Group is not the only dominant group on Treasure Island; the Red Umbrella Group also plays a pivotal role.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even the Red Umbrella Group, relying on its military background, has suppressed the Brilliant Group to a certain extent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne, let me record your facial recognition and fingerprint first, so that you can enter and exit the trading hall at will."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But the permissions for the underground floors will only be unlocked after you are </span><span>officially promoted to supervisor."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Robert operated the terminal to help Alexander input the information.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, the surveillance system on the island can identify you, so it's much safer. There are always some blind people who like to cause trouble. If you encounter danger, you can be discovered and rescued in time."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thanks, bro."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smiled and thanked him. The surveillance system on the island is said to be able to ensure safety, but it is actually a form of surveillance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As long as they want, they can monitor anyone's whereabouts quietly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Alexander was well prepared. His wireless headphones are the latest high-tech products. They not only have the function of shooting and uploading but can also block signals to hide themselves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After everything was done, Robert gave Alexander a hotel address, which was in the building opposite the square.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>According to Alexander's request, thousands of kilograms of meteorites have been packed and shipped to </span><span>Loscity</span><span> by sea.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only after Robert sent Alexander away did he truly breathe a sigh of relief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Otherwise, having such a powerful master around would really feel like a thorn in the back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this time, Lynne came in, twisting her hips, and asked, leaning down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Butler, what do you want me to do?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Robert looked at her with a forced smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lynne, you made a big deal today. The commission is hundreds of thousands of dollars, which is quite a lot."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lynne became excited and said quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is all because the butler takes care of me. After I get the bonus, I want to leave Treasure Island and go home. I have a mother at home who needs my care."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Robert chuckled and asked playfully, "Do you want to leave Treasure Island and go home?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lynne nodded excitedly, and her plump white breasts trembled and swayed, which was very attractive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Robert stood up and walked to her calmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lynne raised her head nervously and looked at Robert, who was a head taller than her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lynne, what a pity! You are actually quite good-looking and have a good figure. What a pity..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Robert smiled evilly, his eyes filled with sinisterness and coldness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What are you talking about?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lynne was trembling with fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next second, Robert slapped her on the neck and knocked her unconscious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After an unknown amount of time, Lynne woke up staggeringly and found herself in a dark cell.</span></p><div class="pagination">
