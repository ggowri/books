  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander slept in late the next morning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava had already headed to corporate headquarters, working against the clock to </span><span>coordinate their relocation to Treasure Island. The entire operation needed to be completed within a month.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander had barely finished his morning routine when his phone buzzed with a call from Brittany. She and Quentin had arrived in </span><span>Loscity</span><span> and needed to discuss something urgent with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though she hadn't spelled it out over the phone, Alexander had a gut feeling this was about the Sakra Society.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Society's Immortality Serum research had recently hit a breakthrough, and the top brass had placed their bets on Yinson's success.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Ghost's upper echelon, in particular, had taken notice. These bigwigs held serious power in their respective countries, living large with all the perks that came with their positions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They all shared one obsession&mdash;pushing back death's clock. Despite their wealth and influence, time was the one enemy they couldn't buy off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their families were just as invested. The younger generation wanted to keep their elders around longer. After all, family longevity meant keeping their grip on power and resources.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They'd arranged to meet in a suite at a five-star hotel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment Alexander walked </span><span>in,</span><span> Quentin jumped up with an eager smile plastered across his face. He ushered Alexander to a seat and rushed to fix him some coffee.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One look at Quentin's bloodshot eyes and overly accommodating behavior told Alexander everything he needed to know. He was sitting on something big.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alex, thanks for coming all this way. Have a seat and grab some coffee. Let's talk this through," Quentin said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite being a general and having a granddaughter who was close with Alexander, Quentin carried himself without any of the usual military stuffiness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sir Thompson, if you've got something you need help with, let's get straight to it," Alexander said bluntly. With things brewing with Brittany, he wasn't in the mood to waste time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, here's the deal..." Quentin launched into an explanation of the Sakra Society's recent activities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His expression turned serious as he continued, "High Command has ordered me to get my hands on a sample of pure Immortality Serum. They want the National Research Institute to analyze it. Just in case things go south, we need to be prepared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm hoping you can help me out with this one. I'll be honest. I'm not confident we can pull it off without you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"According to our intel, Yinson's got a secret base operating on the outskirts of </span><span>Newbrook</span><span>. They've been pretty active there lately. We're thinking that's our best shot at getting what we need. What do you say?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quentin finished his pitch and looked at Alexander hopefully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A smile spread across Alexander's face. "Looks like somebody up top finally woke up and realized Yinson's </span><span>gonna</span><span> cause some serious trouble if we don't stop him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The request couldn't have come at a better time. Alexander had a score to settle with the Sakra Society, and helping Quentin would give him the perfect opportunity to </span><span>make his move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sure, no problem. When do we head out?" Alexander agreed without hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A grin spread across Quentin's face. "We'll move out soon. Strike their secret base tonight!" His voice carried a deadly edge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's gaze drifted toward the interior of the building.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quentin caught his look and smiled knowingly, "Brittany's part of the strike team. You'll see her soon enough.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Command pulled together a special ops team of our best metahumans for this mission. They're training at </span><span>Newbrook</span><span> Military Base right now. Want to check them out?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, I'd like that." Alexander nodded, curious to see just how powerful the military's metahuman program had become.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under Quentin's direction, they made their way to the helipad on the roof. The chopper lifted off smoothly, banking toward </span><span>Newbrook</span><span> Base.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The helicopter touched down at the base, and Quentin rushed into the command center.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander!" Brittany's face lit up as she sprinted toward him, her voice ringing with excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was wearing a fitted training outfit that accentuated her athletic figure. The form-fitting fabric highlighted her curves in a way that would turn heads at any high-end gym in town.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anyone would agree she was a knockout. She was the kind of beauty people would expect to see on a magazine cover, with the fitness level to match. She had that rare combination of natural grace and athletic power that demanded attention.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander couldn't help but notice how the training gear gave her an extra edge of confidence today. There was something especially striking about seeing her in her element.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, I knew you were coming, so I took a break from training. Want to check out the facility?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brittany hugged Alexander's arm without a hint of self-consciousness, completely ignoring the stares from others around them. Her eyes crinkled with genuine joy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander nodded and let Brittany guide him toward the training area.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, you smell amazing..." Brittany murmured, leaning in close enough that he could see the flush spreading across her cheeks.</span></p><div class="pagination">
