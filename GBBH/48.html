  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Oscar's face darkened instantly upon hearing those words.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He angrily demanded, "Hawthorne, what's your game? Trying to curse me or something?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander replied coolly, "I'm looking out for you, Sir Stewart. My advice? Keep your cool these next few days. If anything flares up, come see me right away."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Oscar slammed his fist on the table. The coffee cup tipped over, spilling brown liquid everywhere.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Ms. Blackburn, can't you keep your lapdog in check?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava's eyes flashed dangerously. She said sternly, "Sir Stewart, he's my boyfriend. Show some respect."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Oscar sneered, "Ms. Blackburn, you're the CEO of the Saint Group. You could have any man you want. Why the hell are you shacking up with this lying piece of trash?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But Ava's faith in Alexander remained unshaken.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Sir Stewart, I really think you should listen to my boyfriend. If he says you might have Parkinson's, there's a good chance he's right!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Oh, come on, Ava. I thought you were an intelligent woman. I can't believe you've let some con artist pull the wool over your eyes. I guess I was wrong about you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Oscar stormed off in a huff.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava reached out to stop him but hesitated, words failing her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander watched Oscar's retreating figure and confidently said, "Don't worry. Within a week, he'll be begging for my help."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He then chuckled softly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Everyone thinks I'm just your kept man, living off your money. Even if they respect and fear me on the surface, it's only out of deference to you.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But I promised I'd make everyone see that I'm absolutely worthy of you!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander's words deeply moved Ava.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Emma, who had been silently observing, shot Alexander a nasty look and muttered under her breath.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Ms. Blackburn, Sir Stewart is a big shot in The Kaylon. Teaming up with them would only benefit the Saint Group. But Alexander deliberately pissed him off. It's infuriating.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You need to think this through. Don't let him fool you..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Before she could finish, Ava coldly cut her off with a wave of her hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I've told you that before. I won't tolerate this nonsense. Since you can't change your attitude, you can hit the road. I don't need a secretary who disrespects my boyfriend."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Emma's face instantly drained of color, her body shaking violently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Ms. Blackburn..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She tried to plead, but panic robbed her of speech.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava paid her no mind, linking arms with Alexander as they walked towards the inner office.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Emma attempted to follow but was blocked by two security guards.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Ms. Atwood, you've been terminated. You can leave, but you can't enter."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Emma trembled, trying to explain, but couldn't utter a word. She wondered if she was really messed up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Meanwhile, Jane returned home in a daze.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She recalled the scenes from the ball, picturing Alexander and Ava arm in arm, cuddling intimately. Her heart felt like it was being stabbed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"How can this be happening?" she muttered, unable to believe what she'd seen with her own eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The entire Fairfax family learned the news and fell into despair.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">They'd prepared a feast, waiting to celebrate Jane and Ryan's return. Now, it was all for nothing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Worse, Ryan had been arrested, his fate unknown.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Andrew's face was a mask of disbelief.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Sweetheart, am I having a nightmare? How could the CEO of the Saint Group fall for that loser, Alexander?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Belinda Fairfax, Jane's mother, wore a complex expression as she mused.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I find it hard to believe, too, unless Ms. Blackburn's gone completely blind."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jane gritted her teeth and said, "Remember that day? The woman who came with Alexander to sign the divorce papers? That was Ava, the CEO of Saint Group."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Before she could finish, the living room TV began broadcasting an interview with Ava and Alexander.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava openly admitted Alexander was her boyfriend, clinging to him during the interview with a gentle, doe-eyed demeanor.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jane grew angrier by the second.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"That bastard! Alexander must've been cheating with Ava all along. Those two-timing snakes. That bitch, I'll make her pay."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Andrew and the others stared at the TV, their faces a mix of embarrassment, shock, and regret.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After the news segment ended, the whole family sat in stunned silence for a long moment.</p><div class="pagination">
