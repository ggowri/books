  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ladies and gentlemen, our first auction item today is a stunning diamond necklace, meticulously designed and crafted by the renowned jeweler, Jude Grant."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The large screen displayed the dazzling necklace, its alluring sparkle captivating everyone in the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The opening bid is set at 560 thousand dollars, with a minimum increment of 10 </span><span>thousand. Let</span><span>&rsquo;</span><span>s </span><span>begin!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the auctioneer's voice echoed, paddles shot up around the room, and in the end, the necklace sold for an impressive 700 thousand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander watched in disbelief. Spending 700 thousand on a necklace seemed utterly outrageous to most people.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The world had become starkly divided between the wealthy and the poor, with the rich indulging in their luxury while the less fortunate struggled to survive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Next up was a piece of antique pottery from three centuries ago.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Alexander's interest waned as he eagerly waited for the coveted yellow gemstone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before he knew it, three items had already been sold, and one had gone unsold, yet the prized yellow gemstone remained elusive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Noticing Alexander's growing impatience, Ava leaned in with a reassuring smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't rush it; that yellow gemstone is worth at least tens of millions. They always save the best for last."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander nodded, muttering, "I just hope I don't have to fight too many people for it. I want to grab it at a reasonable price."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava smiled. It was Alexander's first auction, and he was underestimating how competitive it could get.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rare gemstones like that were highly sought after, and whether for collection or for a master jeweler to craft, they could significantly appreciate in value.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thus, the exceptional yellow gemstone undeniably became the object of pursuit among the wealthy and powerful gathered in the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, the auctioneer called for the next item: a meteorite the size of a basketball.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Surprised by this unexpected twist, Alexander focused intently. Using the Force, he sensed a high metal content within the meteorite.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ladies and gentlemen, we recently acquired this fascinating meteorite. The starting bid is five million, with a minimum increment of 50 thousand!" the auctioneer announced with a grin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without hesitation, Alexander raised his paddle. "Five point one million!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His bid immediately drew attention from the crowd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Whispers erupted as people speculated, "Does Alexander have a thing for meteorites?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Could there be a connection to the magic powder?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Five point two million!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Five point five million!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Six million..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The price soared, all thanks to Alexander's bidding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Eight million!" he exclaimed, jumping the bid by two million, clearly determined to secure the meteorite.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the backing of the Saint Group and the magic powder, Alexander felt confident that no one in </span><span>Loscity</span><span> could outbid him financially.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The room fell silent; after all, it was just a meteorite. While it had scientific value, the big players in the room weren't exactly researchers and had little interest in collecting such items.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The bidding frenzy was entirely driven by Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as it seemed the meteorite would fall into his hands, a cold, challenging voice broke through the silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Eight point one million!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd turned to see David casually lounging with his legs crossed, a cigar pinched between his fingers, wearing a smug expression as he locked eyes with Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava leaned in</span><span> with concern</span><span>. "Did you cross David? What happened?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander scratched his head, reluctant to mention Mary's involvement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He recalled how Mary had filled him in on the altercation with David after their last encounter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Nine million!" Alexander shot back, raising the stakes once more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gasps filled the room as the crowd buzzed with excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Can you believe this? This meteorite's max value is around seven million, and here it is hitting nine million. Is Alexander just throwing money around?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Seems like it. But the real story is the showdown between David and Alexander."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Many spectators were eager to see how this would </span><span>end</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Alexander </span><span>had</span><span> the magic powder, there was an underlying tension in the room. While everyone outwardly acted as allies, deep down, many felt that David's power and status far surpassed </span><span>Alexander</span><span>&rsquo;</span><span>s</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>David hesitated for a moment, his expression darkening as he raised his bidding paddle once again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Nine point one million!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This price had already pushed him past his mental limit; to him, it was just a worthless chunk of rock. His bidding was more about baiting Alexander than genuine interest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But for Alexander, that stone was priceless. The more he could gather, the better off he'd be in forging a Lightsaber.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Alexander was about to increase his bid, he was caught off guard when Ava shot her paddle into the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ten million!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
