  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The car door swung open, and a group of men charged out aggressively.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander immediately pulled Ava behind him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Ms. Blackburn, don't be afraid. I'll protect you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava felt a surge of warmth in her heart. Despite facing eight or nine men, Alexander showed no fear.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava chuckled and said, "Just a bunch of trash. I'm not scared."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As the CEO of the Saint Group, Ava had seen plenty of fights and never bothered with small-time thugs like these.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Boss, that's Alexander!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The bald man eagerly pointed at Alexander.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Billy sneered, threatening.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Kid, come with us to the hospital to see Mr. Hawkins, or we'll kill you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander calmly replied, "Ryan started it. He deserved what he got."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Billy, infuriated, shouted, "Still talking back? In this world, might makes right. Right now, we've got the numbers, so it's your bad luck to be caught!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander looked at him with pity. "Are you sure numbers matter?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Billy's gang burst into laughter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Boss, this kid's an idiot. Let me knock some sense into him."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The bald man drew a shiny knife and walked toward Alexander with a sinister grin.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava immediately stepped out from behind Alexander, glaring at the bald man.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If anyone dares touch him, I'll wipe out your entire family!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'll handle this."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander said, trying to shield Ava again, but she gently pushed him aside.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Seeing Ava, Billy froze, showing a flicker of recognition. He thought, "She looked familiar, but I couldn't quite place where I'd seen her before."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The bald man didn't recognize Ava, but he was instantly captivated by her beauty.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Hey, bitch, watch your mouth! Or are you asking for sex?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He leered at Ava as he moved closer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava, enraged, shouted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Billy, do you have a death wish?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At that moment, Ava's demeanor was no longer tender and flirtatious towards Alexander. She radiated the commanding presence of a leader.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her stunning face, combined with that demeanor, sent a chill through everyone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Bitch, you dare threaten our boss? Boys, let's take her down and have some fun!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The bald man sneered as his group got ready to pounce.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava stared at Billy, speaking each word slowly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Do you really not recognize who I am?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Billy slapped his forehead, suddenly remembering.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He shuddered violently, cold sweat breaking out on his forehead, his back drenched.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The bald man, eager to please, leaned in.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Boss, let's take this bitch too. You can have her first..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Shut up, you idiot!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Billy roared, swinging his arm and landing a hard slap on the bald man's face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If you want to die, don't drag me with you!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The bald man held his burning cheek, stunned by the sudden turn of events.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The others were equally shocked, unsure of what was happening.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Under the astonished gaze of his men, Billy ran over to Ava and bowed deeply with a fawning smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Ms. Blackburn, I truly didn't recognize you just now. Please forgive me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava's expression was icy. Being insulted by the bald man in front of so many people had put her in a foul mood.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Billy, your Wolf Gang is really something now. It won't be long before you have Loscity at your feet."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava's murderous intent was palpable, sending a shiver down everyone's spine.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Billy's face turned pale with fear. If the Saint Group decided to act, not only would the Wolf Gang be wiped out overnight, but his entire family would meet a terrible fate.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Ms. Blackburn, you're joking, right? In front of you, I'm just an ant on the ground. You could crush me with a single step."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I see your Wolf Gang has grown quite bold!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava's voice was full of anger as she slapped Billy across the face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Still thinking about kidnapping Alexander? Still planning to rape me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Billy fell to his knees with a thud, slapping himself hard across the face and pleading.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Ms. Blackburn, please spare me! I had no idea Mr. Hawthorne was your friend, or I wouldn't have dared come.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It's all his fault! He was disrespectful to Ms. Blackburn. I will teach him a harsh lesson."</p><div class="pagination">
