  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander smiled faintly, his voice dripping with cold amusement. "What's the matter? Still not convinced?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Slap!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A vicious slap echoed through the room, landing hard on Thomas' face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thomas let out a loud cough, blood spraying from his mouth, along with several broken teeth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He barely had time to react before Alexander's backhanded slap sent him stumbling sideways.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Slap!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Both of Thomas' cheeks swelled up, turning red as if someone had inflated them with air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You... What do you want from me?" Thomas gasped, struggling to speak through the pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander's eyes gleamed as he leaned in, his voice quiet but chilling. "I want all of your shares in Silver Shield Security."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Not a chance!" Thomas gritted his teeth, defiance still burning in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander's smile didn't fade. Without a word, he stepped on Thomas' left hand, crushing it underfoot like a mere insect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ah!" Thomas screamed in agony as the sound of cracking bones filled the air, his left hand broken beyond repair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yet even in this pain, he still glared up at Alexander with hatred.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Stubborn fool," Alexander muttered, his voice growing colder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He kicked Thomas in the ribs with brutal precision.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thomas was sent flying across the room, his body hitting the floor with a sickening thud. The impact felt like his organs had been shattered. Blood poured from his mouth, staining the floor as he struggled to breathe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'm giving you five minutes to make up your mind," Alexander said casually, taking a seat on the nearby sofa. He crossed his legs in a relaxed posture, his confidence radiating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If you don't want to hand over the shares, I'll send you to hell. Then, your precious son Jordan will inherit everything. I'll deal with him next."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thomas' face drained of color, his expression shifting from defiance to terror. His mind raced, unable to find a way out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"How much did Alvin offer you?" Alexander continued, and his voice was deceptively friendly. "I'll give you three times that. What do you say?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander remained silent for a moment, picking up the gun that had fallen to the floor and placing it in Thomas' trembling hand, guiding it to Thomas' temple.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thomas' eyes widened in fear. Desperately, he cried out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"No! Please! I'll give you the shares! Just spare my life, and I'll transfer them to you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His voice was laced with bitterness, anger, and regret. Despite his words, the thought of giving up everything he'd spent decades building stung deeply. But survival instinct had long overtaken his pride.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Silver Shield Security was a titan in the security industry, a company the Nicholson family had built up over more than sixty years. Its assets had crossed the billion-dollar mark, and Thomas had poured his soul into its growth. Letting it go without a fight felt like a betrayal, but in the face of Alexander, there was no other option.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander's expression remained impassive, and his eyes were cold as he glanced at Thomas. "If you can't bear to let go, that's fine. Once you're dead, I'll go deal with your idiot son."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"No! I'll transfer it! I'll give it up!" Thomas choked out, his body trembling with fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander gave him a look of disdain, as though he were staring down at a beggar from on high.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He knew exactly what Thomas was thinking&mdash;he would play along now to survive, but as soon as he got the chance, he'd try to take revenge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Too bad for him, Alexander wasn't going to give him that chance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Good. Start writing then. Make it thorough and clear."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander tossed a piece of paper and a pen onto the table.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thomas' hand shook as he reached for the pen, his body slick with sweat. His fingers trembled as he began writing the transfer agreement, each stroke of the pen marking his reluctant surrender.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Within minutes, he had completed the agreement, signed it, and clutched it tightly, unwilling to let go.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander calmly took the document from his hand and scanned it with practiced eyes. There were no flaws.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Heh, now that's more like it," he said with a twisted smile. "You've learned to read the room. Don't worry, I'll keep my word&mdash;I won't kill you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thomas exhaled shakily, relief flooding his system. As long as he lived, he could find a way to reclaim the shares later.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander stood, and his gaze was indifferent. "Tell your people to release Alvin and Maxine."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Yes, yes, of course!" Thomas immediately grabbed his phone, dialing the number to order his men to release them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Once that was done, Thomas looked up at Alexander, his voice barely a whisper.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I've done what you asked... Can I leave now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander's lips curled into a smile, though it held no warmth. "Leave? Oh, I see. You're planning to go back and rally your forces to fight me, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You&mdash;what?" Thomas' face turned pale as realization dawned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He'd been deceived.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>All this time, he had thought Alexander was a man of his word. Now, he saw how wrong he had been.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander's chuckle was dark and chilling. "Don't worry, I won't kill you. But you know... some crimes can't be avoided."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With a swift motion, Alexander slapped him on the shoulder, and a surge of unseen Force coursed through Thomas' body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thomas froze, his breath catching in his throat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What... What did you do to me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander's voice was cold as he gazed at him, eyes like the void.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Nothing much. Just making sure you don't have too much time left."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Go ahead and arrange your affairs," he continued, his tone indifferent. "You've got about an hour. That should be enough."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With that, Alexander turned and strode out of the room, his footsteps echoing through the silence that fell over the now broken man.</span></p><div class="pagination">
