Each time, they ended up exhausted, falling unconscious from the strain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>By nightfall, the three women were sound asleep.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander sighed, closing his eyes to meditate as his mind raced with plans. He knew he had to seize control of Mandale Town. While Loscity remained his base, it wouldn't be long before he moved to Treasure Island.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He had no idea what the Sakra Society was planning, but he was certain it wasn't good.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Loscity had already been devastated by the witchcraft plague. He wouldn't let Monica get away with it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He'd been patient long enough. It was time to show his power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The construction of Treasure Island had to speed up. He needed to secure the surrounding islands to strengthen his defenses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Only the power he held in his own hands could be trusted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If he could control the City of Sorcery, that would give him another powerful advantage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The next morning, Alexander and Yvonne prepared to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alyssa, Beverly, Xavier, and hundreds of others gathered to see him off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The crowd watched silently as Alexander's car sped away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Are we really letting him go alone? Just with that unreliable woman?" Alyssa muttered, her tone full of frustration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Beverly shot her a sharp look. "The master's decisions are not for you to question. Show some respect."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She didn't dislike Yvonne. In fact, she felt a certain connection with her, given their similar pasts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alyssa huffed but fell silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Xavier frowned. "I trust Alexander. He doesn't act without a plan. We don't need to worry."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Beverly's voice was icy. "Our job is to protect Mandale Town. That's what we'll focus on."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alyssa opened her mouth to say something but thought better of it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hundreds of eyes followed as Alexander's car disappeared into the distance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Catemacola in Mesco was just the surface of the City of Sorcery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The true City of Sorcery was hidden in a remote mountain valley, far from the bustling town.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Today marked the 100th anniversary of the City of Sorcery&mdash;a grand celebration that would bring together all the wizards.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The most prominent wizards eagerly anticipated their invitation from Monica.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The City of Sorcery boasted over a thousand wizards, scattered around the world. But on this day, most of them had returned to celebrate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Many powerful factions from Catemacola had also sent representatives, including the Mafia and the Sakra Society, now allies of the City of Sorcery. High-level delegates from both groups were present at the celebration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Only the wealthiest, most powerful figures from various organizations were in attendance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A temple, deeply rooted in local tradition, stood proudly in the valley.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Inside, important guests from all sides offered their congratulations to Monica.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone tread carefully around the cruel Monica, showering her with praise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ms. Quinn, the City of Sorcery has flourished so much under your leadership. We all admire you greatly."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Indeed, the City's success today is all thanks to Ms. Quinn."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"We're fortunate to be in your presence, Ms. Quinn. May we continue to receive your good fortune."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Flattery filled the air. Everyone knew better than to provoke Monica. If she was displeased, she could easily wipe out entire families. No one dared to be careless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Monica beamed with pride, her smile wide and commanding. "Thank you all for coming to this celebration. The City of Sorcery is already 300 years old, but this is just the beginning of our glory."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She surveyed the important figures before her with a look of triumph.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Yes, 300 years is only the beginning. We'll surpass our ancestors," one of the guests chimed in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"That's right. Under your leadership, Ms. Quinn, the City of Sorcery will achieve even greater things," another added, their words dripping with praise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Monica's pride swelled. Even she, known for her cold demeanor, couldn't help but feel pleased at their adulation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Two days ago, she had found her lover, Rock.</span></p><div class="pagination">
