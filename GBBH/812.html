  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>By the time Alexander flew back to Loscity, it was already evening.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Sir, you're back!" Just as he arrived at the villa's entrance, Rosalia and Charlize came out happily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander walked over with a smile and hugged them both in his arms. "Thank you for taking care of Ava and Ashley's safety. Were you looking forward to my return? Did you miss me?" he said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Rosalia reached into Alexander's pants with a playful smile, saying, "Sir, we did miss you, but we know the rules. You must be going to see Ms. Blackburn and her mother first, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Charlize pouted, a bit jealous. She grabbed Alexander's hand and placed it on her ample breast, trying to get him to massage it a few more times.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander said with a smile, "You two go rest first. I'll make sure to comfort you properly tomorrow."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Really? It's a deal!" Rosalia and Charlize's eyes both lit up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander kissed and caressed them until they were panting and could hardly hold back, and he let them go back to rest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This was Alexander's deliberate action, aiming to stir their desires, making them burn with longing until the next day.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When the three of them had sex together tomorrow, they would be even more eager and sensitive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander didn't tell Ava about his return, wanting to surprise her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When he arrived at the second floor of the villa and approached the master bedroom door, he immediately heard Ava and Lynn talking inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander felt a surge of joy, thinking, "Lynn is training her daughter again while I'm away?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He channeled the Force and immediately saw through the door into the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Lynn was sitting on the leather sofa, her face slightly flushed, adding to her beauty, clearly indicating she had been drinking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ava affectionately wrapped her arm around Lynn's neck. "Mom, do you miss Alexander?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Of course, I do miss him, but it's nice having you here. Come on, give me a hug."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As they spoke, the two women embraced, their pink tongues entwining sensually as they gently caressed each other's bodies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mom, are you going to train me again? I'm scared..." Ava blushed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Lynn gave her an irritated glance and said, "If you don't improve your skills of seducing men, there will be more and more women around him. You don't want this either, do you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ava pouted unhappily and muttered under her breath, "So what if there are more? He'll only marry me anyway. Strong men always have many women around them."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Lynn pinched her daughter hard on the chest and ordered with a sullen face, "Behave yourself. Go take a shower and then put on the things I bought for you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She picked up a paper shopping bag from beside her and thrust it into Ava's arms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ava picked up the bag and ran into the bathroom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This girl is just too naive. Men are so fickle. If one day he gets tired of my daughter, what will we do then..." Lynn muttered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She sighed and then took off her clothes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She had another shopping bag beside her, which contained a set of erotic lingerie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander could see that in the bathroom, Ava was trying on clothes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was a set of white erotic lingerie, stockings, and a pair of silver leather high heels. Since it was thong-style, there were no panties.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander smiled, thinking she had quite good taste.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After Ava finished washing, she put on the erotic lingerie. The two round holes in front exposed her entire pair of plump breasts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The top edges of the stockings were adorned with lace trim, and they were connected to a thong with two straps.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The outfit that Lynn changed into in the bedroom was almost exactly the same as Ava's, except that it was black.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After a while, Ava walked out of the bathroom, swaying her hips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Lynn looked at her daughter and couldn't help but smile, "No wonder you're my daughter. You're so beautiful."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"No matter how beautiful I am, I can't compare to you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ava blushed and hugged Lynn again, both of them kneading each other's firm, plump buttocks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They kissed passionately, their ample breasts pressed tightly together, rubbing against each other constantly, with their pink nipples already standing erect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Lynn reached out to touch Ava and found her hand sticky, clearly indicating that Ava was becoming aroused and increasingly sensitive.</span></p><div class="pagination">
