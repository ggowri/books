  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander asked, "What do you want?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We want some power elixirs to improve our strength!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosalia and Charlize both gazed at Alexander with anticipation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He suddenly understood. He had thought they wanted to get intimate with him again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No problem! But there is no rush. I will teach you how to meditate first and then use the power elixirs. In this way, the side effects of the elixirs will be minimized."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was glad that Rosalia and Charlize were so motivated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Augusta and William had tried it. After learning meditation, they awakened their ancient bloodlines and significantly increased their strength instead of being affected by the side effects of the power elixirs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you, Mr. Hawthorne!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosalia and Charlize, one on the left and the other on the right, threw themselves into Alexander's arms and hugged him tightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They stared at him with their charming, watery eyes. Their pretty faces blushed with shyness. Even a fool would know what they wanted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He pinched their plump breasts and smiled, "Be patient. You can't be too tired when learning meditation, so you should endure it for a while."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After the three of them returned to the room, Alexander taught them the Warrior's unique meditation method.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite being the most basic part, it would benefit them for a lifetime.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Augusta and William were perfect examples.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosalia and Charlize, with excellent understanding, soon entered into a state of meditation.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander did not disturb them but quietly left the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had been aroused by them just now, so, of course, he had to go to Cloe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had been staying on Treasure Island, managing all of its affairs on his behalf. She worked hard and had the least chance to see him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cloe came out of the bathroom and was wiping her wet hair with a towel after a shower. Suddenly, she saw a man sitting on the sofa with a smile on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She let out a scream.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a panic, Cloe quickly covered her plump breasts. Upon realizing that it was Alexander, she ran over in shyness and annoyance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her unusually voluptuous breasts trembled with her steps, and it was extremely </span><span>tempting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cloe lay in Alexander's arms and asked coquettishly, "Mr. Hawthorne, didn't you go to the party?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He chuckled, "I miss you. After all, you are my cousin, so, of course, I have to care about you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh! Mr. Hawthorne, you are so playful. I am embarrassed..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cloe was too embarrassed to raise her head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although she was only adopted by Guzman and wasn't related to Alexander by blood, they were nominally cousins.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Be good, my dear cousin. Let me taste whether your mouth is sweet or not."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander kissed Cloe. She obediently extended her tongue, entwined it with his, and sucked it greedily.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a while, she began to pant, with saliva stringing at the corners of her mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you clean?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander grinned and patted her butt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cloe nodded softly and then kissed and licked his neck and shoulders all the way down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He groaned with comfort, rubbing her breasts and pinching her nipples.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cloe felt both pain and pleasure, and her whole body was numb. She was eager to have sex with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Smart, she knew that her loyalty and complete submission would definitely help her secure things that ordinary women could not get, such as power, status, and money. She had been faithful to Guzman before, but he had never given her those.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kneel down and let me check."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander patted Cloe's butt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She knelt down compliantly and raised her full, round buttocks high.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander kneaded her buttocks hard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your buttocks are big, round, tender, and bouncy. You're really a stunner."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cloe said shyly, "Mr. Hawthorne, as long as you like it, every part of me is to please you. You can do whatever you want to me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She humbled herself voluntarily, tried to flatter Alexander like a slave, and even felt a sense of being conquered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He was too powerful. Women all wanted to entrust their fate to a strong man so that they could feel safe.</span></p><div class="pagination">
