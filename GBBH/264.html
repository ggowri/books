  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shadow was shocked and said, "Mr. Hawthorne, you are amazing!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was also very shocked. It was the first time he met a strong man who was equally powerful as him, and he was his father's bodyguard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Godfather had strong power indeed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne, I was rude."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shadow bowed slightly to Alexander, completely different from his previous arrogance and indifference.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sure enough, only by having strength could one gain the respect of the strong.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander remained humble as always and bowed slightly as well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "Such a strong man is more than just a guard beside my father."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne, you are not only extremely talented but also humble. You are indeed the best candidate to be the Godfather's successor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But Mr. Anthony Hawthorne also has his own merits. No one can tell what will happen in the future."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shadow chuckled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was obviously in a good mood because he was able to successfully obtain Ancestral Witch's Cane.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne, can you tell me why you are so skilled? Even Mr. Augustine Hawthorne couldn't defeat you with Ancestral Witch's Cane."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying that, Shadow stared at Alexander to see his reaction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This question was asked by the Godfather, and Shadow was also very curious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was so young and used to be a bullied person at the bottom of society. It was unbelievable how he suddenly became so powerful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smiled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I have a teacher, James from the nursing home. I have been secretly learning from him for twenty years. Before, my teacher asked me to hide my strength, so I could only remain unknown."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shadow suddenly realized.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had investigated Alexander carefully and knew that Alexander did have close contact with James. On the surface, Alexander often went to the nursing home to take care of him and had done so for twenty years.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There are so many hidden masters in the world. I didn't expect that..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shadow sighed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you, Mr. Hawthorne, for clearing up my confusion. I'm going back now. One last reminder, don't underestimate Mr. Anthony Hawthorne. He is much more difficult to deal with than Mr. Augustine Hawthorne."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying that, Shadow waved to Alexander. Then, he untied a lifeboat and jumped down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The lifeboat quickly disappeared into the night.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was stunned. He didn't expect Shadow would leave in such a desperate way. This was in the ocean.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If an accident happened to a small lifeboat, there was a high probability that passengers on that boat would die.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the distance, from the darkness, the loud and clear singing of Shadow could be heard faintly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The singing was passionate, vigorous, and powerful, revealing an indomitable momentum.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander thought, "Shadow! What kind of person is he?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander stood on the deck, looking at the direction the lifeboat left, feeling very complicated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After returning to </span><span>Loscity</span><span>, Alice reluctantly asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne, if you have nothing to do tomorrow night, can I treat you to dinner?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Alexander could agree, his phone rang. It was Ava calling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey, how did you know I was back? I wanted to give you a surprise."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smiled, and Alice, who was watching from the side, immediately felt jealous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I arranged for someone to wait at the dock. How could I not know that you're back?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava said with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You should have a good rest today. Tomorrow night, accompany me to the Hansen family to attend a dance party. It's hosted by Orion. He's very successful now. I don't know how he connected with the military. Lara hasn't had a good time lately. She keeps asking me if you are back..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava's tone became a little heavy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander frowned immediately. He remembered Lara said that on the first of next month, Ralph would announce the successor to the family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this critical moment, Orion had established connections with the military, which was not good news.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The military was the largest force in the country. The reason why the Red Umbrella Group was feared and sought after was because the Red Umbrella Group was a strategic partner of the military and had an extremely deep military background.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander thought, "Now that Orion had established connections with the military, was the Red Umbrella Group involved in this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander started thinking and was lost in thought for a moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, what are you doing? Why aren't you talking?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava's voice woke him up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay, I'll accompany you to the dance party tomorrow night."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander agreed without even thinking about it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After hanging up the phone, Alexander smiled and said, "Did you hear everything? I'm going to the Hansen family to attend a dance party tomorrow night."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alice frowned and said solemnly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I feel like this dance party is not simple. Maybe it's a trap!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
