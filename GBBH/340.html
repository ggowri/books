  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcos and Owen hugged each other and had sex.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Zachary and his men finally opened the door, the scene inside the room dumbfounded them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Owen and Marcos both had blood all over their buttocks, obviously suggesting their sexual activity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcos, a superstar in </span><span>Tijuanea</span><span> and Caleb's son, was the center of attention.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Someone secretly took photos of the scene, which immediately went viral throughout </span><span>Tijuanea</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bastard!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon learning the news, Caleb flew into a rage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He kicked the table over and roared, "Gather up. I want revenge!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, he led more than a hundred robust men and a dozen cars to the hotel where Madelyn and Alexander were staying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The pedestrians backed away in fear, knowing that his fury would surely result in a bloody massacre.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Back at the hotel, Madelyn immediately started packing up her belongings and asked Avery to leave with her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Avery asked with concern, "Do we have to leave? Our work isn't done yet."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Madelyn quickly told Avery what had happened and tried to persuade her to get out of </span><span>Tijuanea</span><span> together. Otherwise, they would meet their doom if Caleb came.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Avery grew anxious and angry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Owen and Marcos deserve to die, but Alexander is too reckless. How could he do this?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Caleb is ruthless and vindictive. He will surely take revenge on us. We may not have enough time to escape and can only call the police!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smiled calmly, "No need to escape. I have already contacted the military. Mr. Myers, the director of the </span><span>Tijuanea</span><span> Bank, will be here soon. Unfreezing the funds is just a small matter. He will definitely agree to it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What do you mean? Do you know someone from the military and Mr. Myers?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Madelyn gazed at Alexander in confusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Avery hurriedly asked, "Are you telling the truth? We are in trouble, but you're still joking."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Believing that Alexander was most likely lying, she wanted to slap him in annoyance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Madelyn swiftly stopped her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander is trying to help us. He shouldn't be held accountable for the current situation."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Avery growled, "Madelyn, you have been fascinated by this guy!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Madelyn's pretty face instantly blushed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, several black cars pulled up at the hotel entrance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the middle was an extended bulletproof vehicle. Apparently, a big shot had arrived.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>More than a dozen fully armed men got out of the cars and quickly cleared the surrounding area, taking up vantage points and keeping a sharp eye on the situation around them.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The doors of the bulletproof car were only opened after it was confirmed to be safe. Then, Quentin and a gray-haired man came out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Thompson, did you mobilize so many soldiers just to help Alexander from </span><span>Loscity</span><span>?" Dawson asked curiously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quentin patted his shoulder and smiled, "Dawson, thanks to Alexander, my grandson escaped danger this time. I hope you can give me some face."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dawson chuckled, "We have been friends for decades. I will listen to you. But it will be really embarrassing if people know that we personally visit a junior."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quentin said, "We have no choice. He is very capable. We might need his help someday. We better tolerate him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, Madelyn and Avery were still busy with their luggage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, there were chaotic footsteps outside, followed by a knock on the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Madelyn and Avery were taken aback, thinking that Caleb's men came so quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander couldn't help laughing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It must be Mr. Myers. Open the door."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Avery rolled her eyes at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't believe you. How could Mr. Myers come to us on his own initiative?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite her trust in Alexander, Madelyn also felt that he might be mistaken.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was another knock on the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey, why don't you believe me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander could only open the door himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quentin and Dawson stood in the doorway, grinning broadly, followed by a crowd of guards, assistants, secretaries, and other subordinates.&#8203;</span></p><div class="pagination">
