  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Several guards were chatting outside the hallway.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Man, who would have thought even the Red Umbrella Group would get pushed around one day?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, now I'm too scared to even step out of the company's doors. It's too risky out there."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Honestly, I'm considering taking out one of the higher-ups, grabbing some cash, and bailing."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They kept whispering, oblivious to the unusual activity in the yard outside, chatting away without a care.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who's the one that put a bounty on us on the Dark Web, anyway?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One of them asked, puzzled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No idea... but I heard it's because the chairman ticked off a serious big shot in </span><span>Loscity</span><span>."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh! A real big shot?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No wonder, no wonder the bounty's so huge!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The guards were happily chatting away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, a team had already infiltrated the courtyard outside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Phoenix Team, a well-known mercenary squad on the Dark Web, was led by their captain, Danielle Reed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Danielle was a well-known beauty with blonde hair and mixed heritage, her skin as soft and flawless as porcelain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had a slim, curvaceous figure full of energy, golden hair, and delicate features. It's truly a work of art.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her style was strikingly bold and hot; when she walked down the street, people often </span><span>mistook her for a supermodel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, fully geared up, Danielle had an added air of power, looking both fierce and dashing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To many men's </span><span>regret</span><span>, Danielle was married and had just had a baby, still in the breastfeeding stage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Danielle saw the high bounty on the Red Umbrella Group, she immediately gathered her team to infiltrate the group's headquarters and capture Felix.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix was now worth a hefty one billion dollars alive!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite recently having a baby, Danielle showed no signs of weight gain and looked exceptionally fit and curvy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her waist was as slender as ever, her skin was even more smooth and soft, and her full chest, due to nursing, appeared particularly rounded and enticing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Danielle's own team members couldn't help but sneak glances at their stunning captain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Danielle's team consisted of over twenty people, mostly battle-hardened men, with a handful of women.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were mercenaries who only answered to money. Protection, assassination, capture&mdash;whatever the job, they'd take it if the price was right.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Phoenix Team had a solid reputation in mercenary circles, not only for their skills and record.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The team's real allure was their beautiful, young, and highly skilled female members, earning them the playful nickname, "Angel Squad."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, with such a high bounty, Danielle personally led her team into Red Umbrella Group's territory.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Captain, bad news! We lost contact with Alyosha and Eva; they might've been spotted."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A burly man reported anxiously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alyosha and Eva were scouts who served as the team's eyes, and although they were women, their combat skills were top-notch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Move!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Danielle immediately ordered them to pick up the pace, personally leading her team into the building.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was already too late. Alyosha and Eva were visibly bound and gagged, placed directly at the elevator entrance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Behind them, a group of Red Umbrella members stood, armed and exuding killing intent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now that they'd been found, Danielle didn't hesitate, raising her gun to fire a burst.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thud!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She shouted, "Release my team! We're the Phoenix Team; we only want Felix. No one else needs to get hurt."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Pfft!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A large man leading the Red Umbrella team spat, sneering with disdain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you think we're scared of you?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Listen up! I'm </span><span>gonna</span><span> count to ten, and if you don't drop your gun, I'll shoot one of </span><span>you for every ten counts!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"One!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Two!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Three... Four... Five... Six..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man used the most effective threat, his arrogance blazing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Danielle was caught slightly off guard; not only did Red Umbrella Group have the numbers, but they were also fully armed and just as formidable.</span></p><div class="pagination">
