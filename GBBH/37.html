  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As Ava seemed on the verge of yielding, Billy's anxiety spiked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If Joseph took him away, his fate was sealed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Billy dropped to his knees and pleaded desperately, "Ms. Blackburn, please save me. From now on, I'll do anything you say."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava remained aloof, offering no response.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Desperate, Billy swiveled and turned to Alexander.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mr. Hawthorne, I'll serve you and be your man. Please, speak for me to Ms. Blackburn."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Max's voice cut through, cold and warning, "I suggest you know your place and stay out of this."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander met his gaze with icy resolve.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Your incapability doesn't mean mine. Billy wants to follow me; I'll protect him."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With those words, Alexander marched toward Joseph, leaving even Ava unable to hold him back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Silence spread in the room. All eyes fixed on Alexander, whose purpose remained mysterious.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With a sneer, Joseph observed Alexander and challenged, "And who might you be, boy?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Are you the head of the Cripples?" Instead of answering, Alexander posed his question.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Joseph answered, "Yes. What do you want to do?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'll do the Cripples a kindness. Kneel, apologize publicly, and you can leave with your crew."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander's tone was so casual that it bordered on mundane.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But his words sparked an uproar among the onlookers. They stared at Alexander like he had lost his mind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">They all believed Alexander acted in such a buoyant fashion due to Ava.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Fury gnawed Joseph.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You want me to kneel and apologize? Are you mad?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You all witnessed it. I didn't want trouble with the Saint Group, but this fool has crossed the line. He must die."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Anxiety gripped Ava, who knew Alexander was skilled. But she also grasped the notion that Alexander was no match for Joseph.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She moved to intervene, only to be restrained by Max.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Ms. Blackburn, it's dangerous!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Whispers filled the room. Many faces lit with schadenfreude.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Alexander is a fool, challenging the Cripples for Billy?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"He must think Ava's protection makes him invincible. Doesn't he see the Saint Group's precarious position?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What an idiot!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If I were him, I'd ignore this nonsense and enjoy my time with Ms. Blackburn."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">All eyes, filled with scorn, fixed on Alexander. They viewed him as a man marching to his doom.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Move, fool!" Joseph roared.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He launched a thunderous punch at Alexander's face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The air whistled with the force of the blow, quicker and mightier than before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander stood frozen, seemingly petrified.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Joseph smirked, certain his punch would shatter Alexander's jaw.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just as panic seized Ava, Joseph's fist met nothing but air.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander, who had been right there, now stood beside Joseph.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Joseph could feel the danger pulsating in the air.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His expression shifted to alarm. He attempted a swift retreat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander smiled and shadowed Joseph.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Feeling the prickling threat at his back, Joseph spun, throwing a desperate punch.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But as he raised his arm, Alexander caught it effortlessly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Despite Joseph's fist being as large as a dinner plate, Alexander's grip was ironclad, unyielding. Joseph found himself restrained, unable to break free.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When Joseph subconsciously raised another hand, Alexander activated the Force and clenched his fist.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The sound of fracturing bones echoed like firecrackers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Joseph screamed as his right hand was forcibly contorted into a grotesque claw. Every bone was shattered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The pain from his hand seeped into his very being. His cries of agony filled the air as he collapsed, writhing in pain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The members of the Cripples exclaimed in surprise and moved to advance, only to be halted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As tensions neared a breaking point, Alexander stomped on Joseph's throat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If anyone dares to move, I will kill him right now!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">An aura of lethal intent radiated from Alexander, silencing the room.</p><div class="pagination">
