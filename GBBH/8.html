  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jane pulled out the divorce papers and threw them in Alexander's face, her expression full of disdain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Sign the papers and get lost. I'll pretend your earlier words were just hot air. This engagement party is too classy for someone of your low status."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The crowd suddenly understood and began whispering and snickering.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"So, that's Jane's useless husband. First time I've seen him."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Pathetic. Can't even keep his own woman. What a disgrace!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Everyone ridiculed Alexander without mercy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander could barely contain his emotions.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Five years. I've endured you all for five long years, and finally, it's over!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">For five years, he had lived like a servant in the Fairfax family, eating leftovers with no dignity or respect, living a life worse than a dog.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But now, the nightmare was coming to an end.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Ryan, if you want a woman as unfaithful as Jane, take her. I don't care one bit."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With that, Alexander deliberately pulled Ava closer to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava's face blushed slightly, but she gently touched Alexander's cheek in response.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Seeing this, Jane was so furious that she nearly jumped into a rage. Ava was far more beautiful than her in every way.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Alexander, how dare you cheat on me!?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander chuckled. "Jane, you were the one who betrayed me and forced me into a divorce. And now you have the nerve to accuse me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jane was at a loss for words, her momentum completely stifled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Hmph!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She turned her attention to mocking Ava.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You really are shameless, Miss. Hugging a piece of trash, I threw it away. It's laughable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"He's jobless, a drug dealer, and his daughter is in critical condition in the hospital. He has no future! Don't let him deceive you!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava's disdain for Jane deepened. "What a terrible person!" she thought.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She tightened her grip on Alexander's arm and declared proudly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I don't care! Only women who are weak, greedy for wealth and power, would think of depending on a man. I find Alexander to be a good man. He's kind, capable, and loves his daughter deeply."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jane's face turned beet red with fury upon hearing such praise.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You're blind! If you don't listen to reason now, you'll suffer for it later."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Meanwhile, Ryan couldn't stop himself from eyeing Ava with greed. She was stunning, far superior to Jane in every aspect.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although Ryan was a business partner of the Saint Group, he had never met Ava in person and had only seen her in work-related photos.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Miss, you look very familiar. Have we met before?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava gave him a scornful glance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You might have seen me, but I don't know you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Really? Then we must have a special connection."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ryan was excited. Since he had successfully stolen Jane from Alexander, he believed he could do the same with Ava.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Adjusting his suit, Ryan tried to appear more gentlemanly and introduced himself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'm Ryan, CEO of the Hawkins Group. I'm 29 and already have assets worth over a hundred million dollars."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava, seeing right through his intentions, replied dismissively, "That's nothing to brag about. There are plenty of people richer than you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ryan's face flushed with embarrassment, but he quickly regained his composure, patting his chest.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"In three days, I'll be attending the Saint Group's ball. Given my long-standing partnership with the company, I have a good chance of being appointed Vice President. The Saint Group controls a fortune worth billions of dollars."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If you're interested, we could have dinner sometime."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jane's face darkened with anger. Ryan was going too far, openly hitting on another woman in front of her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava giggled, covering her mouth as she laughed sweetly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"So, your name is Ryan, the CEO of the Hawkins Group? I'll remember that."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ryan's face lit up. Clearly, he was far more impressive than Alexander, and he thought Ava was interested.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jane, on the other hand, was fuming. "Darling, what do you think you're doing, flirting in front of me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ryan awkwardly scratched the back of his head, realizing it wasn't the right time to pursue Ava.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jane turned back to Alexander and pressed, "Stop wasting time and sign the papers!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Bringing her here to show off is pointless. A woman like that would never fall for you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You think I don't see through this? You must've paid her to act as your girlfriend to protect your fragile ego, right?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander found Jane's behavior increasingly repulsive. The woman he once knew was gone, replaced by this selfish, spiteful person.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Jane, once I sign my name, you will regret this for the rest of your life."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Enough with the bravado. Stop pretending. Just sign the papers already. I don't want custody of our daughter, she's your problem now."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jane couldn't wait any longer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She was impatient to finalize the divorce, even indifferent to their daughter, just eager to marry Ryan as soon as possible.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Without further delay, Alexander signed his name on the divorce papers and flung them at Jane.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The papers, imbued with a touch of The Force, hit Jane's face with the impact of a hard slap.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jane clutched her burning cheek, both shocked and furious.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You dare hit me!?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The room fell into dead silence. No one could believe Alexander had the audacity to strike back at the Fairfax family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You hit my woman?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ryan, furious, charged at Alexander, ready to throw a punch.</p><div class="pagination">
