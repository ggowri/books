  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Excellent!" Byron pumped his fist in excitement, his aged eyes glistening with emotion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We need to work together to take down these monsters before they destroy our world," he declared. "And we'll eliminate those cancers like Yinson and the Ghost&mdash;all of them!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The room nodded in agreement, clearly backing Byron's approach. Murmurs of approval filled the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Humanity was facing an apocalyptic disaster. If they couldn't contain this catastrophe, it would mark the end of human history.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anyone with half a brain could see that Yinson, the Ghost, and their immortality-obsessed followers were digging their own graves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We cannot afford to lose this fight," Byron stated with grave intensity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The generals' faces matched his seriousness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Marshal Byron," one general spoke up, "do you have a backup plan? I mean... if we fail&mdash;and I'm just speaking hypothetically here&mdash;if we can't eliminate these monsters..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Whether intentional or not, his question made everyone freeze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sure, they had discussed using nuclear weapons earlier, but that was about targeting the monsters, not destroying the world itself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now that someone had raised this possibility, they all had to face the uncomfortable question.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What was the point of preserving a world without humanity?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The atmosphere in the command room grew heavier as they confronted the possibility of humanity's extinction from the pages of history.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Humankind's journey had been a long one. From our earliest ancestors to modern humans, spanning over a million years of evolution.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since becoming Earthia's dominant species, this was humanity's first real fight for survival. And the threat wasn't just any danger&mdash;it was horrific monsters, created by the greed and foolishness of their own kind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even a world war wouldn't threaten the entire human race, but this apocalyptic disaster could wipe humanity off the face of the planet, just like countless extinct species before them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Centuries from now, whatever species ruled Earthia next might simply discover traces of human civilization during their archaeological digs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Marshal Byron," the young general spoke up, his eyes fixed intently on Byron. "We need to decide now. What's our backup plan if we fail?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Marshal Byron," Quentin chimed in, "since everyone's here, maybe we should discuss our contingency plans."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I second that!" Another officer raised his right hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Me too!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Agreed!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One by one, the generals raised their hands in support. Their faces were set with grim determination, ready to face whatever came next head-on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Byron surveyed the room, his expression complex and loaded with meaning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone fell silent, hanging on his every word.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If there comes a day when the situation becomes irreversible, when humanity faces extinction," Byron said gravely. "Even if we all stand united and give everything we've got, we might not be able to stop them."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"When that moment comes, I'll activate the Noah Project." Byron's gaze was razor-sharp.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Noah Project had been designed as a contingency plan for world war, consisting of dozens of massive underground bunkers across the country.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These facilities weren't just built to withstand direct nuclear strikes. They were fully equipped with food and water reserves, weapons, manufacturing equipment, seeds for every kind of crop imaginable, livestock, and backup copies of all our scientific and technological knowledge. They had everything needed to rebuild.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If it comes down to the wire," Byron continued, an eerily calm smile playing at his lips, "I'll personally select a core group of survivors to enter the bunkers. Then I'll hit the button myself, launching thousands of nuclear warheads to blanket the entire planet."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The room remained dead silent as everyone processed Byron's words. Even though they'd all mentally prepared themselves for this possibility, hearing it stated so plainly hit them like a physical blow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright then," the young general who'd raised the question was the first to speak up. "If it comes to that, we launch the Noah Project."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Byron spoke again. "To all generals present. Let's fight to the last breath, and I guarantee your families will have priority access to the bunkers."</span></p><div class="pagination">
