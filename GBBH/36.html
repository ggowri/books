  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Tell me! Where are my goods?" Joseph growled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He picked up Billy's gun and pressed it against Billy's forehead.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I didn't do it on purpose. The Blood Gang made me do it. It's all with them. It has nothing to do with me. I swear!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Billy argued with desperation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You collude with the Blood Gang and still claim innocence?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Joseph sneered, his finger tightening on the trigger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Billy gaped at Alexander with terror and shouted, "Mr. Hawthorne, save me! I'll do anything you say from now on..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander moved to intervene.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But Ava held him back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Joseph was a top fighter in the underground boxing scene. That's how he climbed to lead the Cripples in Loscity.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You can't be harmed. Leave this to Max."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Itching for action, Max received Ava's nod and stepped forward boldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Joseph, let's settle this one-on-one. Loser leaves Loscity!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His fist flew towards Joseph's face with speed and precision, rivaling that of Joseph.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Joseph's eyes gleamed with a mix of surprise and malice as he smiled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He turned his head and dodged effortlessly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"The Saint Group hides many talents. Who knew their security head had such skill?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He kicked Billy aside, his knuckles cracking as he sized up Max with newfound interest.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'd rather not clash with the Saint Group. Just let me take Billy, and I'll forget this."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Max's voice was steely, "What do you take us for? A place where you can come and go at will?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With a shrug, Joseph replied, "Then I'll have to take you down first."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Words ceased as Max charged. His fists were like cannonballs aimed at Joseph.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Instead of counterattacking immediately, Joseph moved with the grace of a seasoned fighter, evading each strike with ease.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Max launched a fierce attack on Joseph, with each punch faster and more powerful than the last.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, Joseph weaved his feet in a zigzag pattern, moving with the agility of a cunning fox.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Despite Max's relentless onslaught, he couldn't land a blow on Joseph's vital points. Joseph skillfully blocked each brutal punch, evading danger with a masterful defense.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander called out a warning, "Mr. Blake, fall back!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But it was too late. Joseph, seizing a moment of Max gasping, sidestepped like a specter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Then, he delivered a crushing blow to Max's right ribs.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The impact drew a pained scream from Max, whose face paled as he staggered back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"The leader of the Cripples is a true warrior! His prowess is impressive."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I've heard whispers that the Cripples have a big shot standing behind them. It seems the Saint Group is poised to face a significant setback this time."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Whispers swirled around the crowd, who stared at Joseph with a mix of fear and admiration.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava frowned, and her breath was ragged with suppressed rage, causing her ample chest to rise and fall dramatically.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Joseph, with a menacing grin, taunted Max with a wave of his fist.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Step aside! I've no wish to cross the Saint Group. Be wiser and stop meddling in it. Otherwise, my next punch will be through your liver."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Max, bearing the weight of the Saint Group's honor, would never flinch.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He clenched his fists in defiance and prepared to advance once more.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Do you know who trained me?" Joseph sneered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Who?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Max asked with a frown.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mason Jenkins! The boxing champion!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The name struck Max like a physical blow.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mason Jenkins, renowned for his lethal punches, was a living legend. Rumor had it, he once brought down a buffalo with a single devastating blow.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Still want to fight, Max? I won't hold back next time."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Joseph's eyes glinted with a flicker of murderous intensity.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Max remained silent. His face contorted with conflict.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After a tense pause, he turned to Ava.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Ms. Blackburn, I'm outmatched. Should we let him take Billy for now? A wise man knows when to yield. I'll reclaim our honor later."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava's anger ignited. "Billy is attending this ball, and his safety is our responsibility tonight. If we let the Cripples take him away, what does that say about us?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Max offered a bitter smile, "We're outgunned and outmatched. A shootout would be disastrous. We'll suffer a significant loss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"And once the shooting starts, countless guests are bound to face devastating losses, and their families will undoubtedly bring chaos to our Saint Group."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava fell silent, trapped in the dilemma.</p><div class="pagination">
