  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everything felt like it was spiraling out of Fiona's control, the world around her fading into chaos while all she could focus on was Oswald.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bastards! I'll kill you all!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fiona snatched up her weapon, rage pouring out of her as she fired into the depths of the gaping crack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each shot was fueled by despair, and she charged forward, relentless in her assault against the darkness that had claimed her men.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crack widened ominously, threatening to swallow her just as it had Oswald.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, Norah appeared out of nowhere, grabbing Fiona by the arm and yanking Fiona back with all her strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who the hell&mdash;let me go!" Fiona shouted, thrashing against Norah's grip.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But no matter how hard she </span><span>fought,</span><span> she couldn't break free. Norah, recognizing the fierce desperation in Fiona's eyes, twisted her arm, pinning her to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let me go! I need to kill the monster underground&mdash;there's a monster down there!" Fiona thrashed and roared like a wounded beast, her voice raw with fury and desperation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Have you lost your mind? You can't die! Oswald sacrificed everything so you could live. From now on, you're not just fighting for yourself. You're fighting for him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fiona froze, those words slicing through her rage like a hot knife through butter. She became still, her defiance giving way to shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm sorry!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Realizing she had reached some semblance of calm, Norah carefully released her grip, allowing Fiona a moment to collect herself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They exchanged a glance, both pairs of eyes shimmering with unshed tears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fiona collapsed onto the ground, gasping heavily, like a fish out of water, struggling to catch her breath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's go. He wants you to live! Your life belongs to Oswald now. He wouldn't want you to just throw it away," Norah urged, pulling Fiona to her feet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Initially, Norah had been worried about Fiona's reckless state, but to her surprise, Fiona now appeared eerily calm. With a blank expression, she picked up her gun and machete, moving quietly behind Norah.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Norah's heart ached at the sight, but she turned her gaze toward the night sky and the churning tide of beasts nearby, muttering under her breath, "Alexander, you have to make it back... You can't leave us!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a thunderous crash, the makeshift wall toppled, and containers plunged into the ever-expanding chasm as the ground continued to shudder beneath them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was no doubt now&mdash;something underground was responsible for this earthquake-like devastation, some twisted beast wreaking havoc beneath the surface.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Norah and her team had caught wind of it early and retreated just in time, suffering minimal casualties, but their defenses were crumbling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, they were forced to form small groups, supporting each other in a last-ditch effort to hold the line.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one was wasting time fretting over dwindling ammunition; the priority was to keep those mutated monsters from breaking through.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sound of rapid gunfire mingled with explosions, echoing through the chaos.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Countless beasts collapsed, engulfed in flames, their carcasses piling up in mountain-like heaps.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the bodies stacked higher, Norah's team found makeshift defensive walls, and the pressure eased slightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Alexander pressed forward, a lone figure against the looming torrent of beasts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The ocean of creatures surged relentlessly, an endless tide that threatened to push him back. It was enough to drive a person mad just to look at it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Alexander was unfazed; he powered through the storm like a ship navigating through hurricane winds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the face of the frenzied horde, despair clawed at the edges of his mind, but he brushed it aside, resolutely moving forward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His Lightsaber danced in his hands, each swing painting the night with splashes of blood and shattered limbs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From above, it might have looked like he was surfing atop a monstrous wave, a daring daredevil cutting through the chaos.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The flashing arcs of white light radiated from his saber, resembling a surfboard slicing through a violent sea.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The mutated beasts fell beneath him like waves crashing against rocks, an army of nightmares crashing against his unyielding will, crumbling under the force of his relentless advance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was convinced that the key to defeating the beast tide lay with the mysterious figure in the black cloak, who he believed was hidden at the heart of the horde.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only by eliminating this enigmatic figure could they bring an end to the onslaught.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was hard to fathom how Alexander, single-handedly, had drawn the attention of countless mutated beasts, bearing down on him with more than half of their ferocity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They tried to stop him, to kill him, </span><span>and </span><span>to devour him, but they couldn't.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Alexander drew closer to the center, the hidden presence deep within the horde could no longer contain its fury. It began to marshal the beasts, directing them to </span><span>mount even more vicious attacks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, the dozen red-haired gorillas reappeared, their eyes wild with rage. They charged at Alexander, baring their teeth and swinging their massive arms.</span></p><div class="pagination">
