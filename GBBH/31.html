  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The room plunged into a stunned silence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Who would dare to challenge Ryan so brazenly?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This was not just an affront to him but a direct challenge to the mighty Saint Group.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">All heads swiveled toward the doorway as a figure emerged. There stood a man in a flowing black cloak. He wore a silver mask.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The silver mask concealed his face save for his piercing, luminous eyes. His identity was a mystery.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Despite the mask obscuring his features, the timbre of his voice betrayed his youth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His presence was commanding as his confident stride carried him onto the stage. Seemingly oblivious to the sea of shocked faces, he declared, "Ryan, what gives you the right to stand there and speak?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ryan, red-faced and indignant, bellowed, "How dare you? Who are you to speak here? You hide behind a mask, afraid to show your face!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With a cold smirk audible in his tone, Alexander retorted, "Calm down. I'll reveal my identity soon enough. But first, I have a gift for you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With his two sharp claps, several burly men entered, bearing a sleek, black coffin, which they set down with a resonant thud on the stage. Everyone was stunned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">(&#35793;&#25991;&#22312;&#19978;&#19968;&#34892;)</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander announced with a chilling laugh, "This is the best coffin for you. I trust you'll find it to your liking."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ryan turned furious and thought, "This was not just an insult but a public humiliation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">How could I maintain my stature as the vice president?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">How could my family rise in Loscity after this?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ryan spat with a mix of rage and desperation. "Everyone! He started this! I'm just defending myself."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He swiftly drew a pistol, aiming it at Alexander with a smirk.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Kneel!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Yet, Alexander's composure didn't waver. With a swift, almost ghost-like movement, he struck Ryan across the face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ryan's hand was quick on the draw, yet before his finger could pull the trigger, Alexander slapped him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Bang!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The force of the slap sent Ryan reeling; he toppled over, crashing to the ground. His pistol was now flung from his grasp.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The crowd gasped.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Witnessing the scene, Jane was shocked but felt a jolt of recognition. However, she couldn't place the masked man.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava glanced between Alexander and Anne, who stood by with a knowing smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava thought, "Could this be the new chairman?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Had he not been the chairman, Anne would have never tolerated such audacious behavior, especially not within the hallowed halls of the Saint Group. The very idea of someone bringing in a large coffin would have been swiftly quashed to preserve the company's decorum and authority."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Blood trickled from Ryan's mouth as he stared up in terror.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander lifted him effortlessly and moved towards the coffin.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"For all your sins, Ryan, today you meet your fate," he declared.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With a resounding bang that echoed through the room, Alexander forcefully flipped open the coffin lid. In one decisive motion, he hurled Ryan into the coffin.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ryan, now a mix of fury and fear, screamed for action from his allies.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Ms. Hollister, Max, what are you waiting for? Are you just going to stand there? I am the vice president of the Saint Group! Are you going to allow this man to degrade me in front of everyone and turn the Saint Group into the laughingstock of Loscity?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Snapping out of her shock, Jane dashed towards Anne.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She pleaded, "Ms. Hollister, my fianc&eacute; is the vice president handpicked by the chairman himself. To see him bullied like this in public is not just an insult to him but a direct slap in the face to the entire Saint Group!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Up until this very moment, Jane still harbored anticipation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The Saint Group, after all, stood as an unassailable titan in Loscity, and its power was bolstered by the shadowy figure of Godfather, a name that alone was enough to quell any opposition, for no one dared to cross him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Yet, Anne's response was a serene smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"The Saint Group is merely conducting business. Please, make way."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The crowd, buzzing with shock, parted. Whispers filled the air.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Who is this audacious young man?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Even with his powerful connections, it won't matter here. This is Loscity. Here, home ground advantage could trump even the most formidable outsider."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"He must be an adversary of Ryan. He's got courage and skill. But it's unfortunate for him; Ryan isn't the man he once was, who has ingratiated himself with the chairman of the Saint Group."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Feeling a surge of hope, Ryan gritted his teeth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Boy, do you dare to cross me? I will return this humiliation a hundredfold!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Under the collective gaze of the room, Anne moved with deliberate steps towards Alexander.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander stood still as if he was in fear.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jane's sneer was triumphant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I doubt you have the nerve to defy the Saint Group. Are you scared now? Too frightened to even make a move?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With a move that left every onlooker in utter disbelief, Anne stood before Alexander.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She bowed deeply to Alexander and softly declared, "Nice to meet you, Chairman!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Max, alongside dozens of security guards, snapped to attention. Their legs clicked together, spines straightened, and in a chorus that reverberated through the hall, they bellowed in perfect unison, "Good evening, Chairman!"</p><div class="pagination">
