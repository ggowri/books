  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The door slammed shut with a loud bang, nearly hitting Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Slightly annoyed, he hopped on his small motorbike and quickly rode off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inside the villa, Maris peered out the window and saw Alexander leave. She let out a sigh of relief. "Good thing I took the antidote beforehand, or I'd really be in trouble."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, her phone buzzed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feigning indifference, Maris glanced at the WhatsApp message. A smile spread across her face as she read it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxwell Freguson had arrived. Everything was ready.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"See? I told you living alone was dangerous, but you wouldn't listen!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She sighed dramatically and poured Silvia half a glass of wine, handing it over casually.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Here, drink this. It'll calm you down."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Silvia frowned and stared at the glass but didn't drink.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maris froze. She feared Silvia had figured something out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Silvia, what's wrong? Don't tell me you don't trust me. Fine, I'll drink it myself!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She quickly took a large gulp.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Silvia blinked and immediately snapped out of her thoughts. "Maris, you misunderstood. I was just thinking about my engagement to Lonnie."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At those words, the smile vanished from Maris' face. She pouted and said, "Aren't you happy? The Atkinson family is one of Kylaville's most prestigious. Lonnie is their first heir. What more could you want?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Silvia sighed softly. She could feel the envy laced in Maris' tone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lonnie Atkinson wasn't just wealthy. He was handsome and had studied abroad. Many women fawned over him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Silvia couldn't care less. Lonnie had too many rumors swirling around him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He claimed they were just harmless flirts, but Silvia had seen through his playboy nature long ago.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Hewitt family had been in deep debt after a failed gamble with the Atkinson family. They owed a billion dollars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the Hewitt family's entire fortune barely totaling two billion dollars, losing a billion dollars would wipe them out, pushing them out of Kylaville's elite circles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Silvia had no choice. Under family pressure, she was forced into an engagement with Lonnie. That marriage would save the Hewitt family a billion dollars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she couldn't accept it. She refused to let this marriage ruin her happiness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Cheers!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Silvia clinked her glass with Maris and drank it all in one go.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Drinking won't fix my problems. I really don't like Lonnie."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maris chuckled coldly, "Heh, are you trying to show off? You know I like Lonnie. You're just flaunting it in front of me to get a reaction, aren't you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Silvia pressed her hand to her forehead, staring at Maris in shock. "Maris, what are you talking about? What's going on? I feel so dizzy! Did... did you drug me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maris' expression twisted into a grimace. "I met Lonnie first. Why did you have to take him from me? All my life, you've been stepping on me. Now, it's time for you to pay!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She threw open the door. A lecherous man was standing outside, grinning widely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Maxwell, this is the bitch who ruined my plans. Take her now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maris pointed toward Silvia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxwell's eyes practically bulged with excitement when he saw the stunning, flushed Silvia. Today was a real treat. He could have it all... money and pleasure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry, Ms. Becker. If I've taken your money, I'll make sure she gets what's coming to her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxwell eagerly began removing his clothes, still smirking as he moved toward Silvia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hot! So hot..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Silvia mumbled, her eyes growing hazy as she whispered incoherently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What... What are you going to do?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even in her half-conscious state, Silvia was terrified by the grotesque sight of Maxwell approaching her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Heh, what do I want? I think you know..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxwell sneered, reaching out with a vile grin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Silvia's mind was clouded with anger and panic. She could feel herself slipping into unconsciousness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But just then, there was a loud bang! A glass bottle shattered, sending shards flying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxwell screamed in agony as the bottle hit him square in the head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He staggered, clutching his bleeding skull, but before he could see who had attacked him from behind, he collapsed heavily onto the floor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's you! You... How did you come back?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maris stared at Alexander in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She couldn't believe it. Alexander had come back and launched a surprise attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Still holding the broken bottle, Alexander stood frozen, staring at Maxwell, who was now unconscious on the floor.</span></p><div class="pagination">
