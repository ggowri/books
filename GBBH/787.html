  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You used poison in Loscity to cause a plague that killed so many people. You deserve to die!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"And you tried to hurt my daughter and my family. You really deserve to die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander's tone was cold as ice. He beckoned towards the Lightsaber, and a wave of the Force guided the Lightsaber to fly back into his hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In fact, he himself did not expect that he would suddenly burst out with all the Force and launch a successful sneak attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"There's no way... There's no way I can fail..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Monica was full of disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She stared at the large bloody hole in her chest and shuddered uncontrollably.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"No way. You must not die well..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Monica fell heavily to the ground as the crowd looked on in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The ruthless white wizard, the lord of the City of Sorcery, was actually killed by Alexander in a surprise attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander looked at Monica with nothing but bone-chilling coldness in his gaze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Your biggest mistake in this life was messing with me. Go to hell. The City of Sorcery is mine from now on."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander's words infuriated Monica, who rolled her eyes. Her spiteful eyes finally lost all their light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>There was only dead silence in the entire hall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Rock and Monica's blood flowed across the floor as if it were a demonic red flower.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>City of Sorcery's centennial day actually turned out to be the death of the two.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander turned his head to the others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Whether it was the hundreds of wizards or the bigwigs who had come to participate in the celebration, they all backed away in fear, with expressions of great horror and awe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even Monica and Rock were easily killed by Alexander. Who else in the City of Sorcery could stop him?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hundreds of wizards had terrible expressions, and their hands and feet trembled slightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>There wasn't a single one of those bigwigs who didn't regret coming.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Master, please forgive my incompetence in asking you to do it yourself!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yvonne looked respectfully in front of Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander said indifferently, "Your amulet is damaged, isn't it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yvonne wore a regretful expression. "Yes. The defense reached its limit, and it shattered."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Never mind. I have plenty of amulets. I'm not short of power elixir for boosting powers either. These are a reward for you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander took out a jeweled necklace and a couple of power elixirs and tossed them to Yvonne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Thank you, Master. I would serve you to death."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yvonne was trembling with excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone present was in awe. Yvonne suddenly became so powerful because of Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The expressions of the many wizards immediately became complicated as they looked enviously at Yvonne, and the gazes they looked at Alexander were filled with intense anticipation and thirst.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They thought that if Alexander could give away such precious treasures casually, Alexander's strength must be so strong that it was unimaginable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The City of Sorcery respected the strongest most!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A number of wizards believed that if they could make Alexander the lord of the City of Sorcery, they would be rewarded by Alexander as Yvonne was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They became excited and looked at Alexander with eyes that were no longer cold but full of ingratiation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Master, Mafia and Sakra Society have sent representatives to the celebration. Shall we kill them?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yvonne pointed at the representatives and asked Alexander for instructions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander narrowed his eyes slightly as he looked towards them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The representatives of the Mafia and the Sakra Society were terrified.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne, please spare us. We didn't want to go against you. We were all forced by Brandon."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Yeah. That old bastard Yinson forced us. Please let us go."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander sneered. His expression became extraordinarily cold. Obviously, he was going to kill again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone's breath abruptly choked, and a chill ran through their bodies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Representatives of the Mafia and the Sakra Society cowered into corners in fear, like lambs facing a tiger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Kill them!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander waved his hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Shadow rushed in with hundreds of strong men.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They all wore black uniforms with the Ultimate Alliance logo embroidered on their left chests, murderous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>These people were either metahumans with psychic powers or martial arts experts. Aided by combat exoskeletons, they were mighty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Outside the hall, there were hundreds of fully armed soldiers with black gun muzzles sticking out of the windows, aiming at the wizards.</span></p><div class="pagination">
