  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava was shocked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had long suspected that Alexander was the president of the Saint Group, but she never imagined that the Warrior was actually real.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At first, Ava struggled to believe it, but as she recalled Alexander's extraordinary abilities and her unwavering trust in him, she quickly became convinced.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander explained, "I don't want to force anyone; doing so would only lead to them becoming a Corrupted Warrior. Right now, you're the only one who knows my true identity, so you have to keep it a secret."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava was trembling with excitement, thrilled that she had earned Alexander's trust.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She exclaimed, "Alexander, I always knew you weren't a lecher. You want to enhance your strength, and I'll definitely help you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But even if you have many women, I'm your favorite!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course, I promised to marry you, and I will keep that promise," Alexander said, pulling Ava in for a tight embrace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Rebecca and Ava fell asleep, Alexander quietly got up and headed to the study.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was already late at night, and he made a video call with Augusta to get an update on the situation on Treasure Island.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Augusta was patrolling the island, searching for members of the Red Umbrella Group and waiting for the right moment to act.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He reported, "Boss, I suspect Felix has arrived on Treasure Island. The Red Umbrella Group started constructing numerous buildings on the island the day before yesterday, and there are many construction sites."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, a group of burly men closed in on Augusta.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One of them sneered, "Hey! Look who it is&mdash;the Brilliant Group's spy! How dare he trespass on our territory? Grab him and interrogate him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The leader of the group grinned menacingly, "Get him alive! There's definitely a reward!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah! Then we can hit up a strip club and have some fun," the others chimed in, eyeing Augusta with malicious intent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander burst out laughing. "Augusta, looks like you're in trouble!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The group immediately irritated Augusta.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The lead man threatened him, "Come with us, or you'll be in trouble! I'm a level-one Shadow Warrior!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You are just a level-one metahuman, and you think you can intimidate me? Go to hell!" Augusta sneered, furious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He roared, his already tall frame swelling as his skin darkened and his nails and teeth sharpened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a swift motion, he slashed through the air with his claws.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, the leader, who boasted of being a Shadow Warrior, was sliced into pieces, collapsing like a broken toy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Augusta moved like a blur, leaving several of the men on the ground, screaming and bleeding profusely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their cries started out loud but quickly faded into desperate whimpers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moments later, they were all huddled on the ground, cut to shreds by Augusta.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander, who had witnessed the scene unfold, was shocked and quickly asked, "Augusta, are you on the brink of level-three superpowers?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Augusta nodded, and a hint of pride in his voice. "Yes, Boss, but I feel a bit strange. Look at my nails and teeth; they've changed so much."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With concern, he asked Alexander, "Boss, am I going to </span><span>be</span><span> okay?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's expression turned complicated. "The dual abilities of strength and speed can eventually lead to complete mutation, reverting someone to their primal form, turning them into a being with werewolf genes."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His All-seeing Eyes had detected Augusta's genetic changes, allowing him to make an accurate assessment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Werewolf? I have werewolf genes?" Augusta was initially startled, then waved fists with excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Werewolves were incredibly powerful warriors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander carefully inquired about all aspects of Augusta's transformation before concluding, "It must be due to your meditation practice. You learned my method, which has allowed you to gain werewolf genes as you grew stronger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And you won't suffer from the typical drawbacks of a werewolf; you won't lose your sanity, and eventually, you'll be able to shift between human and werewolf form at will."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Augusta was overjoyed and filled with gratitude towards Alexander. "Thank you, Boss! If you hadn't taught me how to meditate, I wouldn't have become so powerful!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
