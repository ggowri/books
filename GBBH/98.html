  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander snapped back to reality and quickly shoved the piece of meat into his mouth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"This is incredible! So tender and flavorful!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He wasn't exaggerating; the food was genuinely delicious.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The table was laid out with braised short ribs, vegetable Salad, black pepper beef stir-fry, pan-seared fish, and a generous bowl of cream of mushroom soup.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The spread was simple, but it was rich in color, aroma, and taste, making it irresistible.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He couldn't stop eating, savoring each bite.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava watched him with a satisfied smile as he enjoyed the meal.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Don't rush, take your time," Ava said, serving him more food with an attentive touch.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As she moved, the low neckline of her top revealed glimpses of her smooth, full cleavage.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander's gaze lingered, his mind racing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander couldn't help but admire it privately, "The view is stunning! So tender and soft."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava, oblivious to his distraction, continued to serve him, refilling his plate and offering him more.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava suddenly exclaimed, "Oh, by the way! I got us a special bottle of wine. It's all the rage in high society right now, and I had to pay a pretty penny to get it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She proudly presented a bottle with a unique design.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The wine inside had a faint bluish tint.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As she opened the bottle, a crisp, enticing aroma wafted through the room. It was undoubtedly a fine wine.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava poured a glass for Alexander, then one for herself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Cheers!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">They clinked glasses, and Alexander took a deep swig.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The wine was indeed exquisite&mdash;smooth and melting on his tongue, with an unusual but familiar flavor.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He couldn't quite place it, but it seemed oddly recognizable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava took a hearty gulp, her cheeks immediately flushing a bright, peachy pink.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"This wine is amazing! No wonder everyone's after it," Ava said, unable to contain her praise.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander agreed; the wine was not only delicious but also left him feeling pleasantly buzzed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">They toasted again, and soon, both of them were slightly flushed, with a warm sensation spreading through their bodies.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Suddenly, Alexander froze, staring at the bluish liquid in his glass.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He thought, "Could it be that the wine has been laced with magic powder?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The more he thought about it, the more certain he became.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander thought, "The familiar scent and taste are unmistakable. Though magic powder is harmless on its own, when combined with alcohol, it has a potent aphrodisiac effect.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">No wonder it is popular in high society. Ava seems unaware of its effects."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Hehe... I'm feeling so warm all of a sudden!" Ava giggled, unfastening two buttons on her top.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her already ample cleavage was now half-exposed, a tantalizing sight.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander felt a tightening sensation in his pants, a wave of desire washing over him like a lava flow.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If it were anyone else, Alexander might have tried to control his rising lust.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But this was Ava, his girlfriend.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He embraced his feelings, letting his desire surge like a relentless tide.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Are you hot? I feel so warm... What's going on?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava's voice held a note of confusion and discomfort.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Despite the air conditioning set at a cool 75&deg;F, she was uncomfortably overheated.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She even found Alexander more attractive by the minute, her thoughts drifting to touching his abs.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander watched as Ava's gaze grew sultry, her cheeks flushed. She even unfastened another button, causing her enticing cleavage to practically spill out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He couldn't control himself anymore; it was like a dry tinder meeting a spark, ready to ignite.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava gasped as Alexander pulled her into his embrace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Their bodies, both ablaze with desire, tangled together tightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">They touched each other, feeling the rapid beats of their hearts echoing in their ears.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Their heavy breathing, a constant source of stimulation, only heightened the hunger swelling within them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Under the influence of the magic powder-laced wine, both had lost all rationality, their eyes locked solely on each other's bodies and desires.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava, having drunk less, still retained some clarity, but she showed no sign of resistance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Instead, she pulled Alexander's face closer, kissing him passionately as she pressed him firmly against her chest.</p><div class="pagination">
