  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clara's eyes brightened; marrying Clay would be a great opportunity for Sophie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her daughter was undervalued in the Reynolds family, but Richard held Clay in high regard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If this marriage happened, her daughter's status would rise significantly, and she might get a share of the family wealth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Clara was about to voice her support...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shut up, you jerk! I won't agree to this! Whoever wants to marry him can, but I'm out!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sophie snapped, directing her anger at the one who made the suggestion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clay was livid, practically fuming.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You can't just insult me like that, Sophie! You've crossed the line!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Coming from the City of Sorcery to Kingsdon, he had always been treated with respect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But facing Alexander, Nancy, and Sophie, he had been humiliated time and again. It was driving him insane.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander stood by, watching the drama unfold, amused by Nancy's sister's fierce spirit, while Clay's dignity crumbled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Enough! Everyone quiet down!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Richard slammed his hand on the table, furious. "What are you all shouting about? Does the Reynolds family have no pride? If this gets out, how can we hold our heads high?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Right now, both Richard and Luther felt stuck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy and Sophie were adamant about not wanting to be with Clay, putting everyone in a tough spot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clara stepped over to Sophie's side, anxious to persuade her daughter, "Sweetheart, this is a golden opportunity! With the City backing us, our status in the Reynolds family would skyrocket..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No way! Mom, I absolutely refuse to marry him! Seeing that face every day? I'd rather die! If he looked like Nancy's boyfriend, I might reconsider."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sophie shot a playful glance at Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clara was left speechless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone heard Sophie's comment and exchanged looks filled with mixed emotions, glancing at Alexander and then back at Clay.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was no denying the stark difference in their vibes. The Reynolds family gave Clay a chance, but he just wasn't cutting it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clay was grinding his teeth, seething with rage; he had to make Alexander pay.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, you better treat Nancy well. I have high hopes for you," Gill said, pulling Alexander's hand, and offering a warm reminder like an elder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander could only nod along, occasionally acknowledging her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luther's face darkened, and he quickly snapped, "What are you all standing around for? Get the matriarch inside to rest!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The housekeeper snapped back to reality, hurriedly trying to assist Gill.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Gill didn't want to leave; she clung tightly to Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Nancy, you two have to be happy! Have lots of clever, adorable babies; more kids, </span><span>more blessings!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luther slammed his hand on the table, shouting, "Nancy, think this through. If you dare to be with this punk, you won't just lose your position as the boss of the Kaylon; you could be kicked out of the family!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gill immediately protested, scratching Luther's face in anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shut your mouth! Anyone who dares to bully my daughter and her husband will have to deal with me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luther's face was now marked with several bloody scratches, and it hurt like hell, sending him into a rage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Quick! Get her out of here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A few housekeepers rushed to pull Gill away, but she stubbornly refused to budge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were afraid of hurting her, leading to a standoff.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clay was grinding his teeth; Gill was one of the obstacles in his plan to win over Nancy and her sister.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought maybe he could take care of her now, not only eliminating a rival but also pinning the blame on Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without making a fuss, Clay subtly waved his hand towards Gill.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A thin stream of dark energy shot towards her, quietly blending in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ugh! Why do I feel a bit dizzy..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gill pressed her hand to her forehead, looking unsteady, barely able to stand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Watch out, something's off!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander quickly steadied Gill, channeling his Force into her to block the dark energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had clearly seen Clay's little trick; it was definitely some sort of sorcery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gill collapsed, and Alexander caught her just in time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luther was seething.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What the hell are you doing? You think you can come here and act like a creep? Are you looking for trouble?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He already disliked Alexander; seeing him hold his wife made him even more furious.</span></p><div class="pagination">
