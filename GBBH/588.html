It's all thanks to Alexander that I'm okay!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm really fine now. I feel so relieved."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luther froze, staring at Gill in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Honey, you... you recognize me? Are you really better?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gill hadn't recognized him for years, and she had even pushed him away, so it was surprising to hear her say his name aloud.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Luther, I'm clear-headed now, all thanks to Alexander."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gill's tears flowed freely, overwhelmed with emotion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The troubling memories of her recent mental state were still fresh, but thanks to Alexander, she had her health back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luther held Gill and cried, repeatedly apologizing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy's tears streamed down her face as she looked at Alexander with gratitude, unsure how to express her thanks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander chuckled, thinking that healing Gill's mental issues was just a small feat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Richard and the Reynolds family members were dumbfounded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gill, who had been mentally unwell and even beyond Clay's help, was suddenly restored to health so easily by Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was clear that Alexander wasn't the one harming Gill; there had to be someone else behind this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone wasn't na&iuml;ve; suspicious glances turned toward Clay.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clay's face paled as he realized things had backfired on him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander wasn't going to let him off the hook; he strode over to Clay.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feeling guilty, Clay instinctively took a step back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander zeroed in on him, closing the distance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Clay, you've been causing harm everywhere&mdash;this is unforgivable!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clay quickly denied it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't you dare accuse me! When have I harmed anyone? You're the one causing </span><span>trouble!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's fury erupted as he stood right in front of Clay.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clay felt like Alexander was an insurmountable mountain, making it hard to breathe under the pressure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What do you think you're doing? Today is Grandpa Richard's birthday. Are you planning to make a scene here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's anger was palpable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You lost that bet and were supposed to leave Kingsdon, yet you still have the nerve to cling to Nancy. That really ticks me off!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, the entire hall was filled with a chilling menace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't just Clay who felt the cold sweat trickling down his back; Nancy and the others also felt the tension and began to step back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't push me, or it'll be the end for both of us!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clay's expression darkened. He had thought he had made significant progress recently and could compete with Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now he realized he was utterly mistaken.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The power gap between him and Alexander was vast, and the way Alexander had lifted the curse was still a mystery to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, Alexander vanished, appearing like a ghost right in front of Clay, and slapped him hard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Smack!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clay's vision blurred, and before he could process what had happened, his face burned with pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander had struck with such speed that Clay hadn't had time to react.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clay touched his cheek, feeling five angry red finger marks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hit him! Beat him up! Come on!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy cheered, clapping her hands and pumping her fists for Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sophie also felt immensely satisfied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had wanted to slap Clay for a long time, and one slap was hardly enough.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get him out of here! Kick him out of Kingsdon!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy urged with determination.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kick him out? Sure!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a pained scream, Alexander kicked Clay hard, sending him flying across the room and rolling on the floor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clay clutched his chest in agony, roaring, "You, Alexander! My mentor is a senior elder in the City of Sorcery. He won't let you off, not for a second!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a fit of rage, Clay resorted to threatening Alexander with his connections.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Trying to threaten me, huh?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander stepped forward and slapped him again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clay was sent crashing to the ground, seeing stars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've dealt with the City's wizards before. What's an elder to me? You can call him here, and I'd still dare to kill him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's murderous aura was palpable, his tone chilling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Faced with such a relentless force, Clay found himself utterly speechless, trembling like a mouse under a cat's paw.</span></p><div class="pagination">
