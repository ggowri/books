  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Since some people have improved their abilities or extended their lifespans, it proves that the Potency Potion does work. It's just that some substances in it are harmful to the human body that have not been discovered...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If we can eliminate the harmful substances, there will be no side effects."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander took out the potential potion, wrapped the potion bottle with the Force, slowly penetrated it, and sensed the ingredients in the potion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Alexander was not a scientist, he could accurately find the ingredients that were harmful to the human body through Force Sense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After carefully sensing it for a while, Alexander gained some insights.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The potion did contain some harmful substances. Alexander couldn't tell what they </span><span>were, but Force Sense told him that this substance was dangerous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fortunately, the Force could completely refine and eliminate this harmful substance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In other words, after the potential potion had been refined by Alexander's Force, there would be no side effects.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But this was just Alexander's preliminary judgment and had no actual basis.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he rashly let Augusta Dent and the others share this potion, there might be unknown dangers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was a person who cared about his subordinates. Since Augusta Dent and the others were truly following him, Alexander would not let them put themselves in danger easily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But if he did nothing, one day when the Red Umbrella Group had perfected the potion, they would train a group of terrifying elites.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By then, except for Alexander, Augusta Dent and the others might not be able to protect themselves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why don't I try it myself first..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When this thought came to Alexander's mind, he couldn't control himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, he was protected by the Force, and his physical fitness was far stronger than others. Since some people were fine after taking potential potions because of their strong bodies, Alexander felt that he could do it too.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he used the Force to refine the harmful substances first and then took it, there might be no side effects at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander looked at the red liquid with desire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After thinking it over again and again, he could no longer bear it, opened the bottle of medicine, and smelled it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was a pleasant fruity aroma, but he couldn't tell what it was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wrapped the liquid medicine with the Force and refined all the harmful substances in it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The scent of the medicine changed again, becoming several times stronger. The whole room was filled with the aroma, and Alexander couldn't help but be refreshed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After hesitating for a few seconds, Alexander finally poured half of the medicine into his mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To ensure the safety, he only took half.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A cool liquid flowed down his throat and instantly spread throughout his body, filling every muscle, bone, and even every cell.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander instantly felt his heartbeat slow down, from normal heart rate to fifty, thirty, twenty per minute...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the temperature continued to drop, Alexander's eyes went dark, which was a sign of insufficient blood oxygen supply.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The experiment failed!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander wanted to use the Force to refine all the medicinal liquid in his body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His heart which was about to stop beating slowly quickened its pace again, and each beat became extremely powerful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Originally, Alexander's heartbeat was slower than that of ordinary people, but because he was very strong, his heart's blood supply capacity far exceeded that of ordinary </span><span>people.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His heartbeat was now slower than before, but the output of blood oxygen had increased a lot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He succeeded!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander became excited. This meant a significant improvement in his physical fitness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He immediately sat cross-legged and began to meditate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under the stimulation of the Force of the yellow gemstone on his neck, </span><span>Spellweave</span><span> Pattern emitted a faint yellow light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Countless vitality between heaven and earth gathered and transformed into the Force in Alexander's body...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not know how much time had passed, it was already evening. The lights in the room were off and it was dark.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander opened his eyes. His eyes were bright and shining faintly in the darkness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a while, the light in Alexander's eyes faded and returned to normal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He clenched his fists excitedly, feeling that every cell in his body was cheering and leaping for joy. He was filled with strength and reached an unprecedented peak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With just a gentle wave of his hand, the Force exploded, and the air exploded!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed like a simple move, but it could bend steel bars.</span></p><div class="pagination">
