  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tim couldn't sit still. As a top executive who'd put in twenty years at the Brilliant Group, he enjoyed premium perks including a sweet villa with sprawling gardens on Treasure Island. But right now, none of that luxury mattered as he paced anxiously around his massive living room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even in the 1,000-square-foot space, he couldn't find peace after a dozen laps. His eye</span><span>lids</span><span> wouldn't stop twitching, and his gut was churning with anxiety.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Chill out, Tim," came a reassuring voice. "With Rico and the hit squad backing each other up, Alexander and Cloe are totally screwed."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The elderly man on the couch continued, and his wrinkled face broke into a smile. "Once Sakra Society takes over Treasure Island, you'll be running the whole show</span><span>&mdash;</span><span>not just some port. You're way too talented to be stuck in your current position!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tim frowned at his companion. "Look, Gregory, it's not that I don't trust you. It's just... Alexander's got serious skills and an army of loyal people behind him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If this plan goes sideways and someone gets caught and talks, we're in deep trouble!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gregory Chavez let out an amused chuckle. "Come on, Tim. We've been friends for thirty years. Don't you trust my judgment by now? Sure, Alexander's got game, but surviving an ambush by dozens of pirates plus four elite assassins? He'd have to be </span><span>superhuman to pull that off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Black Widow's never failed a hit</span><span>&mdash;</span><span>she's our ace in the hole. Alexander's as good as dead."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gregory kept trying to reassure Tim, confidence oozing from every word.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It had taken a billion dollars, the CEO of Treasure Island's promise, and thirty years of friendship to turn Tim to their side.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, they had dozens of mercenaries and four elite assassins armed to the teeth on the island.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you sure they won't mess this up?" Tim asked for what felt like the hundredth time. Even Gregory's patience was wearing thin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Gregory didn't answer, Tim's frown deepened, and his gut churned with anxiety.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gregory pulled out a cigar from his case and offered it to Tim. "Come on, guy, stop psyching yourself out. Alexander walked right into our trap. He's done for."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He lifted his chin smugly. "What you need to focus on is how you're going to run Treasure Island once Sakra Society backs you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Tim wasn't sharing his optimism.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He'd crawled his way up through blood and bullets, and decades in this business had taught him better. He'd seen enough to know that no plan was foolproof until it was over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, he was seriously regretting his choice. He'd been living sweetly with his seven-figure salary in upper management at Treasure Island. Instead, he'd jumped headfirst into this mess.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One wrong step and his life would be over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now that he'd taken Sakra Society's money, there was no going back. He'd crossed that line.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Either he or Alexander would make it out alive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Gregory, I can't believe you joined Sakra Society," Tim said, shaking his head in amazement. "Word is you guys are crushing it these days. All the big shots are trying to get in your good graces, hoping for that Immortality Serum."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tim studied Gregory carefully. Back in the day, his Gregory could barely throw a punch. But now, after all these years, Gregory was different. It was like there was some hidden power brewing beneath the surface.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey, buddy, I'm not the same guy anymore." Gregory smirked. "Mr. White saw potential in me. He got me on those enhancement drugs. Now, I'm not just good. I'm elite."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To prove his point, he casually pressed his hand against the solid hardwood table. Without a sound, a perfect hand print appeared on the surface, as if it had been carved there by a master craftsman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tim's eyes went wide. He couldn't help but feel a twinge of envy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew better than anyone that all the money and status in the world couldn't compare to having real power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey, Gregory. Could you put in a good word with Mr. White?" Tim asked eagerly, "I'd kill for a chance to get that kind of training."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gregory grinned smugly. "Relax. Once this plan works out, you'll be running Treasure Island. You'll be a big shot in Sakra Society.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Trust me, Mr. White will take you under his wing. Things are different now. We've made huge breakthroughs with Immortality Serum. We can mass-produce enhancement drugs that make those old power elixirs look like child's play!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
