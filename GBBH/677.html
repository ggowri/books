  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander now trusted Alyssa and the Axe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Alexander understood human nature very well. When people had money and </span><span>power, they would change and become </span><span>more greedy</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alyssa took control of the situation. Even if she didn't change, other people in the Axe would change.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Therefore, Alexander could not let the Axe dominate </span><span>Mandale</span><span> Town. This was the plan Alexander decided to implement after capturing Beverly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Beverly's ability and his secret support, she would be no weaker than Alyssa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In this way, </span><span>Mandale</span><span> Town would form a situation of two strong powers competing for hegemony. But with Alexander mediating, there would be no fierce conflict between the two, and Alexander would be able to control both sides.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beverly knelt down on one knee excitedly and leaned over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She said, "Master, I am willing to serve you forever!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander left the Weaver House with satisfaction. He not only successfully obtained billions of wealth, but also took control of </span><span>Mandale</span><span> Town.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The gemstone trade in </span><span>Mandale</span><span> Town could bring in tens of billions of profits every year. And Alexander could get half of it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, half of the gem resources were controlled by him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was not only a lot of money, and it would also be much more convenient for him to use gems in the future.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The most important thing was that Alexander found the top-grade gems and upgraded the Lightsaber, greatly enhancing its combat effectiveness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But for the Lightsaber to be upgraded again, it also required seven top-grade gems and twelve rare metals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander found that a small part of the metals could be purchased at a high price.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, most civilian companies were unable to own them. He could only seek help from the military.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was in a good mood. And even his steps became lighter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He even wanted to go to Treasure Island and kill Felix.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Alexander returned to the Axe, he was greeted by everyone's awe and gratitude.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alyssa came out with leaders of the Axe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone looked at Alexander with passionate, full of respect and admiration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mandale</span><span> Town was full of gems. Anyone could come here to pan for gold. But the one should be lucky enough and ruthless enough to make money here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were no true friends here but only rivals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The strong were respected!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he was strong and ruthless, he could get everything he wanted in </span><span>Mandale</span><span> Town.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In everyone's eyes, Alexander was such a man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He possessed immense strength and a strong will.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How are Paxton and Beverly?" Alyssa asked expectantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As long as Paxton and Beverly die, </span><span>Mandale</span><span> Town would be dominated by the Axe alone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Paxton was killed by me, but Beverly has surrendered."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander did not explain why he accepted Beverly's surrender. This was the confidence of a strong man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said, "Beverly is already one of us. She will form an alliance with you and control the gem trade with you. How do you think?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander wanted to see how Alyssa would react.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alyssa's face changed. Although Alexander did not say it explicitly, he had hinted that Beverly was already Alexander's person.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rather than saying that Axe and Beverly jointly control </span><span>Mandale</span><span> Town, it would be </span><span>better to say that Alexander was the mastermind behind the two forces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alyssa didn't hesitate and smiled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She said, "We are thankful for your help and credit. Otherwise, we would have perished. Please arrange whatever you want. And we will obey you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"From now on, </span><span>Mandale</span><span> Town will be managed jointly by the Axe and the Weaver family."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alyssa knew very well that Alexander alone could destroy the Axe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If she didn't agree, the Axe would probably end up like the Glory Association and Southern Mining, collapsing and being destroyed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, if the Mafia lost </span><span>Mandale</span><span> Town, they would lose a huge </span><span>amount</span><span> of profits, and they would not give up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Facing the powerful Mafia, the Axe did not have an advantage. They had to rely on Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alyssa knew these.</span></p><div class="pagination">
