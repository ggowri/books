  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The passionate and warm mysterious Force surged over Ava's body, and she felt an unprecedented pleasure that she had never experienced before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava couldn't help but feel limp all over, no longer aggressive under the fierce kisses of Alexander.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander had laid the car seat flat, and the two of them were about to make out in the car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Beep!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Suddenly, a burst of urgent car horns was heard, followed by the powerful roars of the engine.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander looked up sullenly and saw a blue sports car coming with several black cars.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">They didn't look friendly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava was startled and widened her eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"These are the cars of the Brilliant Group. Are we surrounded?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At this moment, Theodore got out of the sports car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He was five feet nine. Although he was gangly, he was dressed smartly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander comforted Ava, "What will be, will be. Don't worry. I'll deal with them."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He opened the car door and got out first.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava stood beside him compliantly. As long as Alexander was around, she was not afraid.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Theodore went up to them arrogantly with a group of people.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Hello, Ms. Blackburn. I am Theodore Tate from the Brilliant Group."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He smiled and extended his hand to Ava.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander couldn't help but frown slightly. Why didn't Betty inform him that Theodore had come to Loscity?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Damn it!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Betty couldn't have betrayed him. It was very likely that something had happened to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava ignored Theodore's hand and said coldly, "Mr. Tate, why did you come to see me with so many people?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Theodore cast a cold glance at Alexander.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Are you Alexander, who is dating Ms. Blackburn?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes, I am Alexander."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander looked Theodore in the eye without showing any sign of weakness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Theodore looked closely at Alexander and couldn't help but smile contemptuously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander looked plain and weak. How could he compete with his uncle to be the successor of Godfather?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The disappearance of Nicholas and Daniel might not have anything to do with Alexander. Betty did not lie. The Kaylon might have taken the two men away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Theodore stretched out his hand and said, "Mr. Hawthorne, nice to meet you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander knew that Theodore had bad intentions, but he shook hands with him without any fear.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When their hands met, Theodore suddenly tightened the grip on Alexander's hand, trying to make a fool of him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander couldn't help but sneer. Theodore had overestimated himself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The next second, Theodore's smirk turned into a mixed expression of shock, anger, and pain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He felt as if his hands were tightly clamped by an iron hoop, and his finger joints crackled under the pinching force.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Theodore struggled desperately, trying to pull his hand back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, Alexander held it tightly, making him unable to withdraw.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander deliberately asked, "Mr. Tate, why do you look so upset? Would you like me to take you to the hospital?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Theodore flew into a rage and wished to skin Alexander alive.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander again tightened his grip and clenched Theodore's hand more fiercely.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Theodore finally threw away his pride and shouted angrily, "Why are you holding my hands so hard? Let go of me. Let go..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander sneered contemptuously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Didn't you want to launch a sneak attack? You've overestimated yourself."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He shook off Theodore, who fell heavily to the ground and moaned in pain, holding his bruised right hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The people from the Brilliant Group rushed over and helped Theodore up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava was very happy to see Theodore defeated. She said with a smile, "Mr. Tate, you're a grownup. Why can't you walk steadily?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Stop pretending. It's obvious that he..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Theodore gritted his teeth and trailed off. Being inferior to Alexander in strength was not something to boast of.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He took a deep breath and tried to calm down.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Ms. Blackburn, the Brilliant Group is eager to recruit talented people. We would like to invite you to join us. Your annual salary will be doubled."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava said indifferently, "Thank you, but I won't leave the Saint Group."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Theodore immediately stopped pretending and revealed his true colors.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Ava, if you don't leave the Saint Group, the Brilliant Group will not spare you. What a pity. You're such a beautiful and charming woman."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If you are willing to be my woman, I'll triple your salary and make you a senior executive of the Brilliant Group. How about that?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Theodore continued to tempt Ava.</p><div class="pagination">
