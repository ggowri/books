  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, he saw the sign for "</span><span>Loscity</span><span> Wealth Counsel."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They not only handled lawsuits but also asset management.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The firm's entrance was grand, and clients coming in and out were all impeccably dressed, either rich or influential.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Alexander walked in, a classy young woman approached him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She looked him up and down, a hint of confusion crossing her face because Alexander was dressed too casually.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sir, this is a law firm. Are you sure you're in the right place?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though polite on the surface, her tone was quite sharp.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander replied coolly, "I want to hire the best lawyer for a lawsuit and also find someone to manage my assets."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The woman was momentarily taken aback and said, "Sir, our best lawyers charge by the hour, and it's over a thousand dollars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Asset management requires even more; we only accept clients with at least ten million dollars in assets, and our fees aren't cheap."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander looked at her coldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What, do you look down on me? I probably have five hundred million dollars in assets that need managing. I'm more worried about whether you can handle it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Five hundred million dollars!?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The woman was shocked, her lips forming an 'O' shape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She never expected him to be an extremely low-key rich kid; it was a total surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Respectful sir, please wait a moment. I'll recommend the best lawyer to you right away."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, crisp footsteps approached from inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A middle-aged man in a sharp suit, with a round belly and a receding hairline, walked out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The woman hurried over, excitedly saying, "Mr. Webb, we have a big client who wants to hire the best lawyer and also needs asset management."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jenson Smith's eyes lit up as he scanned Alexander, then his expression turned disdainful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Reeva, this big client you mentioned is him? I doubt it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander did look quite ordinary in his attire, nothing like a wealthy client, certainly not what they were looking for.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The woman was at a loss for words; after all, Alexander was just claiming to have five hundred million dollars in assets&mdash;nobody knew if it was true.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jenson saw her silence and became even more convinced of his judgment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Reeva, you're not a new employee anymore; remember, some people shouldn't be let in so easily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Our firm's clients are all prominent figures with status, not just anyone off the street."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked at Alexander with a mocking disdain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A glint of sharpness flashed in Alexander's eyes; this guy was too snobbish and looked down on others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tap, tap, tap..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, the sound of high heels echoed, and a slender, sexy young woman walked out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had long hair, delicate and beautiful features, and a pair of enchanting big eyes that were mesmerizing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her white silk shirt hugged her full chest tightly, accentuating her curves, while her form-fitting skirt revealed her long, smooth legs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madelyn, you're an intern, and we have a client here that's perfect for you to handle. I've been good to you, haven't I?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jenson chuckled awkwardly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He kept staring at Madelyn Price's chest, his lewd gaze showing no attempt to hide his desire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This woman didn't understand the unspoken rules; when asked to go out for drinks, she hesitated, so he wouldn't give her any good opportunities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Really? Thank you, Mr. Webb!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Madelyn's eyes lit up. She had been at the law firm for nearly three months and hadn't landed a decent client, just a bunch of trivial cases.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The beautiful woman attending to Alexander quickly said, "This gentleman wants the best lawyer for his case and also needs asset management."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jenson grinned. "Right, look how I'm taking care of you. A big client like this is something most people can't get.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, Madelyn, shouldn't you accompany me for a drink tonight?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Madelyn smiled awkwardly but didn't respond.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The beauty introduced. "Ms. Price, this is Mr. Hawthorne. He says he has five hundred million dollars in assets."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jenson sneered, thinking, this broke loser doesn't have five hundred bucks, let alone five hundred million.</span></p><div class="pagination">
