He suddenly felt a terrifying murderous aura coming from behind him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, a black shadow appeared from the air. A knife moved towards Alexander's right arm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ninja?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander sneered and dodged quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The wooden display case next to Alexander was cut in half and collapsed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Guzman, you hired a ninja?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander dodged the knife so quickly that Guzman was frightened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just now, he was relying on the power of Ancestral Witch's Cane and luckily discovered Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this time, the black figure appeared a few meters away from Alexander, staring at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man had a long face. He wore a black suit with a nine-headed snake tattoo on his left chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He held a sharp sword in his hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, I didn't expect I would meet a young master like you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked excited to fight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Guzman ordered, "Jamari, you are one of the most powerful </span><span>swordsman</span><span> in Nine-Headed Snake Party. Cripple him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jamari turned around and glared at Guzman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Guzman, he is a master. The reward needs to be tripled, otherwise, I will leave."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What? Triple it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Guzman was furious, but then he forced himself to calm down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay, triple it. I will give you nine hundred million dollars. Don't kill him. Just cripple his hands and feet. I need him alive."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Guzman reminded, still thinking of using Alexander for sacrifice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Jamari heard the triple reward, he immediately became excited.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Bryant family members was so frightened that they were shaking all over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You rubbish, you want to kill me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander raised his middle finger to Jamari.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jamari was furious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jamari cursed angrily and suddenly disappeared from where he was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander had already maximized his Force Sense. He seemed like an invisible radar, monitoring the situation within a hundred meters around him clearly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A sharp light flashed, and a knife appeared behind Alexander, stabbing towards his back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was very fast!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Guzman thought he was quite skilled, but he could not keep up with Jamari's speed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jamari came behind Alexander and wanted to stab him to death with one move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ninjas were good at sneak attacks, taking strange and stealthy routes and hitting the target with one strike.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Alexander had anticipated his attack and dodged it easily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shit!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jamari was shocked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He waved his sword, wanting to injure Alexander with one move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's all you can do? You're not fast enough."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander taunted while dodging as a fish in water.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Swish, swish, swish!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jamari waved his sword three times in succession.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had already realized how skilled Alexander was. He didn't care about Guzman's requirement of keeping Alexander alive. He thought that it was a real fight and that he should use all his skills.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jamari was very quick. Everyone around them stepped back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was about to touch Alexander's body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was the first time Alexander had faced such danger!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander took action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stomped his foot hard, and there was a bang!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The hard ground sank, and a deep pit appeared on the deck of the cruise ship.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the help of the powerful reverse thrust, Alexander rushed to the ceiling, and countless ceiling pieces fell from the sky.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jamari used his most powerful move. He was confident that he would win.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unexpectedly, Alexander jumped onto the ceiling and wanted to crush him. Countless pieces of the ceiling, empowered by the Force, became like sharp blades.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Swish, swish, swish!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jamari instantly bleeding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although the sword in his hand was close to Alexander's neck, Alexander was holding the blade with two fingers. Jamari could not move the sword.</span></p><div class="pagination">
