  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander hurried over, cornering Logan and asking urgently, "What's going on?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Logan replied quietly, "Several large carriages just came in through the back door, and they loaded up a bunch of big boxes from the yard."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander said, "They're probably trying to run away! Logan, I need you to follow them. Take my badge and rush to the Darwin Court to ask them to send someone to arrest them."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Logan took Alexander's silver badge and headed for the Darwin Court.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander thought to himself that even though that woman had vanished, there was no evidence to prove she'd been kidnapped. Only by using his badge as a member of the Dominion Church to report to the police could he draw attention to the situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I have to stay close; otherwise, she could be in serious danger," he thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the back door of the yard, four carriages sat waiting, with drivers dressed like Hrodvik people in front.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The wooden carriages were tightly sealed, with movable wooden doors at both the front and back, and the windows were covered with black cloth. They were heading southwest out of Darwin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander crept closer, keeping his distance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>More than an hour later, Logan arrived with a team of guards from the Darwin Court, storming into the yard where the acrobatic performance had taken place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the carriage and Alexander had vanished. Panic set in for Logan, who led the team into the yard to search thoroughly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, a guard shouted, "Ruben, come over here! There's a hidden passage!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Underneath the actor's dressing table, pushed open, was a large wooden board with an iron ring, measuring about 20 inches long and wide.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd gathered around, with four guards at the forefront.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These guards were Jeffrey's right-hand men: Ruben Bender, Seth Frieda, Troy Harmon, and Conrad Warren&mdash;all skilled level-three warriors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seth opened the wooden board, revealing a cellar beneath. He listened carefully but heard nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They all descended the ladder into the cellar, which was about 15 feet long and wide. It was a complete mess, with boxes of various sizes thrown open and clothes strewn across the floor, some belonging to the Risunese, some to women.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Check this out!" Ruben exclaimed, holding up a folding fan and a paulownia wood sign. Everyone gathered around for a closer look.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a long moment, the four men exchanged astonished glances. The quality and craftsmanship of the fan clearly indicated it was something from the palace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The wooden plate was 5.5 inches long and 1.5 inches wide, carved on one side with a man and a woman embracing, and the word "Royal" etched on the back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is the insignia of the Risun cult&mdash;Vivri and Vivisha!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing the grim expressions on the faces of the four level-three warriors, Logan couldn't help but ask, "Why are they kidnapping people?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Risun cult often lures and abducts beautiful women to Risun, where their lives are a living hell," one of them replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Logan was outraged. "What scum!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Darwin court team scoured the cellar and the yard again but found nothing more than the fan and the wooden sign.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a population in the hundreds of millions in Darwin, tracking down a few carriages was like searching for a needle in a haystack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fortunately, they had some leads. Risun was to the southwest, so they must have headed that way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ruben divided them into four teams. He and Logan would lead one team, while Seth, Troy, and Conrad each took charge of their own.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, more than three miles away from Logan and his team, Alexander was stealthily trailing the carriages, his heart growing heavier with each passing moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As darkness fell, the streets became emptier, and it seemed the carriages would not stop.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could only follow them. Logan had probably reported to the authorities, but with Darwin being so vast, they might not find him in time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander grabbed a passer-by in a hurry and asked, "Can you deliver a message to the Darwin Court for me? Here's the money. After you deliver it, see if you can find a man named Logan Ridley&mdash;there's more money in it for you. Thank you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inside Emerald Manor, Jalen was trying to reassure Lana. "Lana, don't worry. Alexander is very capable; they'll definitely bring your master back."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lana's heart was in turmoil. It was getting late, and she still hadn't returned to the palace. She feared the chaos that might have erupted there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lana thought, "But if I go back, I'm certain I'll die. But the princess treated me very nice."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, Lana stood up and pulled on Jalen, pleading, "No. Mr. Cavill, please take me home!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jalen sighed and relented, "Alright. Let's get you there."</span></p><div class="pagination">
