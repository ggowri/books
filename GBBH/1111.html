  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Wait! Did you know they were there the whole time? Why didn't you tell me earlier? You did that on purpose, didn't you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Grace blushed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander smirked, confident.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'll leave first. You don't need to see me off. If Howard still thinks he can get to me, I won't go easy on him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"With the chaos coming, keeping someone like him in the Lawson family is a disaster."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Grace paused for a moment and then nodded firmly. "Okay!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She threw herself back into Alexander's arms, holding on tightly, reluctant to let him go. She looked like a lovesick girl, unwilling to part from him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander felt a deep sense of satisfaction as he saw how completely she had fallen under his control.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After sharing another brief moment, he finally opened the car door and stepped out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Meanwhile, Howard had spotted Alexander, and his face turned dark and fury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"It's him! Alexander! Damn it. I'll kill you..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Though Grace didn't get out of the car, she watched Alexander leave, her face flushed, eyes sparkling with the unmistakable look of a woman who'd just been well-loved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>One of the bodyguards exclaimed, "Mr. Lawson, that guy took Ms. Lawson away! What should we do now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Howard gritted his teeth, his voice dripping with venom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"That slut's face is all blush, her eyes are all teary, and she definitely just got satisfied. That damn whore!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I've been pursing her for years, and now she dares to sleep with another man. Alan Peterson, gather the guys and follow him. I want him dead."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The bodyguard quickly nodded. "Yes, Mr. Lawson. We'll take care of it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander walked ahead, unfazed, with a cold smirk as Howard and his men followed from a distance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Crash!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Suddenly, deafening motorcycle engines roared from behind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Motorcycles came speeding up, quickly closing in on Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander narrowed his eyes and thought Howard really didn't know when to quit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Whoosh!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The lead motorcycle zoomed forward, closing the gap behind Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The rider swung a metal pipe high in the air and brought it down hard toward Alexander's head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Just as Alexander turned around, the pipe was nearly upon him, just inches away from his head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Dare to offend Mr. Lawson? Die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The rider sneered, putting all his strength into the strike, intent on smashing Alexander's skull.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Whoosh!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The pipe sliced through the air, but it hit nothing. Alexander had already vanished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The rider's smug grin froze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He couldn't believe it. He had only struck air. He wondered where that guy went.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In an instant, Alexander appeared behind him like a ghost. He grabbed the rider by the collar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, the motorcycle was speeding forward, and the rider was violently yanked off the bike by Alexander, crashing hard to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Bang!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The motorcycle crashed straight into a large tree by the roadside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The rider's helmet was shattered, with fragments sticking to his head and face, digging deep into his flesh, causing him to scream in agony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Everyone, get him! Kill him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Amidst the roaring of the motorcycles, the tattooed, burly man at the front was furious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Wielding a machete, he seemed to be commanding an army as he charged toward Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Alexander remained calm and collected, standing still in the middle of the road.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Force surged within him, heightening his vision, hearing, and reflexes beyond human limits.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Six more motorcycles sped in from all directions, the riders ruthlessly attacking Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Iron rods and machetes were swung at him with full force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It seemed Alexander was about to be beaten to a pulp, blood splattering everywhere, and Howard watched eagerly, cheering with excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Boom!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Crash!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The sounds of impact rang out one after another.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, to Howard's shock, a few of the motorcycles seemed to hit an invisible wall, flying off like waves crashing against rocks, tires up in the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Including the tattooed man, several riders were thrown to the ground, bloodied and motionless. He was not sure if they were alive or dead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander smiled and clapped his hands and then turned his gaze toward Howard's hiding spot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Howard was completely stunned, trembling uncontrollably as if he were in a nightmare.</span></p><div class="pagination">
