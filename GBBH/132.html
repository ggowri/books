  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander called Augusta to investigate Jackson's details, focusing on tracking down </span><span>the </span><span>his</span><span> location.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After setting things up, Alexander sat down to meditate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he entered a state of deep concentration, he felt the Force he'd used was completely restored.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, most of the Force left by James in his body remained frozen, like ice in the Arctic, waiting to be slowly absorbed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Alexander finally opened his eyes, it was already midnight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Augusta had just sent over a location. "Boss, that</span><span> </span><span>Jackson is hiding at a nearby motel. The guy thinks the most dangerous place is the safest."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander chuckled. Jackson had no idea about the Force mark on him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By now, the Fairfax family had left, and Alexander drove his beat-up Toyota into the night.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, a black Mercedes appeared from the opposite direction, following from a distance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's heightened senses quickly picked up the tail.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He squinted his eyes, ready for some action. "It's likely Sebastian's men. Is it the dark wizard he hired?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander </span><span>kept driving, </span><span>press</span><span>ing</span><span> the gas and sped toward the motel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By 11 p.m., only a dim orange light illuminated the motel's two-story entrance, with no staff in sight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander slipped in quietly, where Augusta met him and pointed upstairs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Following his lead, Alexander reached Room 206.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Keep watch downstairs. Let me know if anything happens." After instructing Augusta, Alexander leaned in to observe through the door crack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inside, he saw Jackson on the bed, wrapped around a naked woman, both in deep sleep.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Judging by the messy sheets, they'd clearly had an intense evening.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander gripped the handle and turned it gently, using the Force to break the lock effortlessly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he entered, neither </span><span>woke up</span><span>&mdash;they'd exhausted themselves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moving to the bed, Alexander pressed a nerve on the woman's neck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She immediately fell into a deeper, unshakeable sleep.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who's there?" Jackson jolted awake, staring in fear at Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Awake? Hand over the money, and I'll let you die </span><span>without pain</span><span>." Alexander's voice was calm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's you!" Recognizing Alexander, Jackson's face turned grim.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hadn't expected him to find him so quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, alright, I'll </span><span>give you</span><span> the money... it's just some money. Here, I'll give it to you," Jackson stammered, reaching under his pillow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander saw through the act and smirked. This man was still trying to resist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next second, Jackson pulled a gun and aimed it at Alexander, ready to pull the trigger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a vicious look on his face, Jackson felt confident, though his speed seemed childishly slow to Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Smack!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Jackson could fire, Alexander slapped him hard, sending him flying off the bed and crashing to the floor, blood pouring from his mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't kill me... I already gave most of the money to Mr. Satan. I still have ten million here. You can have it... take it all."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jackson trembled as he pulled out a check from under the bed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Satan... are you one of his men?" Alexander's eyes flashed with surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Satan was a Mafia godfather, infamous for scams, drug trafficking, kidnapping, and murder&mdash;the only one who could rival "Reaper"</span><span>, Satan</span><span>&rsquo;</span><span>s father</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, yes, I work for Satan. Please, let me go. You </span><span>won</span><span>&rsquo;</span><span>t</span><span> want his wrath." Jackson begged, deeply regretting his decisions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he'd known Alexander was this capable, he'd never have dared to impersonate him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's lips curled into a wicked smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing the smile, </span><span>Jackson grew hopeful, thinking his life might be spared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Since you work for Mr. Satan, that's all the more reason to end </span><span>you</span><span> here. I'd rather not leave loose ends."</span></p><div class="pagination">
