  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Time seemed to stand still as everyone froze in their tracks. Augusta and his group, despite all their combat prowess, found themselves completely paralyzed. They couldn't even twitch a finger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The reality hit them hard. If Alexander wanted them dead right now, even a kid with a butter knife could finish them off without breaking a sweat. The thought sent chills down their spines.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cold sweat soaked through their clothes as the truth sank in. They'd always known Alexander was tough, but this was way beyond anything they could have imagined. His power wasn't just next level&mdash;it was off the charts entirely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, Mr. Hawthorne," they stammered in unison, practically falling over themselves to agree.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander gave a satisfied nod. He'd made his point crystal clear&mdash;between this display of absolute power and the Force control, Augusta's crew wouldn't even think about crossing him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, they felt like they were standing before some kind of God&mdash;one wrong move, one wrong look from him, and they'd be goners.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, enough small talk," Alexander said casually like he hadn't just scared them half to death. "Let's get started with your meditation training."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Augusta and the others could barely contain their excitement as they hung on Alexander's every word.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Following his guidance, they all found themselves naturally settling into cross-legged positions on the floor, starting their meditation the Warrior way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander kept busy during their session, channeling the Force as he moved from person to person, his touches helping to enhance their physical capabilities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Three solid hours passed before they finally came out of their meditative states. Each of them was covered in dark, foul-smelling toxins their bodies had purged.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne, I feel like I could bench press a truck!" Augusta grinned, throwing a few punches into the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosalia took a deep breath, her eyes wide with amazement. "I feel light as a feather&mdash;like I could just float away!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Check this out! I'm stronger than before!" Marvin pounded his chest with his fist several times. The impacts made loud thumping sounds, but he didn't even flinch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>William closed his eyes and smiled mysteriously. "Man, this is incredible. It's like being reborn. I can feel the life force just flowing through me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Logan and Charlize joined in, everyone buzzing with excitement as they shared their experiences.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander watched them with satisfaction, noting how their life force was now flowing strong and steady. The energy in the room was electric with their newfound power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander had used the Force to enhance their physical abilities. With enough meditation, there was a real chance they could awaken to the Force themselves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He sent them off to shower and change clothes. Everyone bowed quickly before heading out, even Rosalia and Charlize, who'd been hoping to make out with Alexander. But covered in dirt and sweat as they were, they decided against it. At that moment, their admiration for Alexander had hit an all-time high.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Two weeks flew by like nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Ultimate Alliance was moving most of its supplies through </span><span>Louvian</span><span> Port to Treasure Island and Devil Island, everything went sideways.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It started about a week ago in the suburbs of </span><span>Louvian</span><span> Port&mdash;reports of wild animals attacking and killing people.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At first, they seemed like isolated incidents, but within days, the number of animal attacks skyrocketed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even rabbits, usually timid and harmless, had transformed into razor-clawed monsters.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Louvian</span><span> Port, once a bustling hub of activity, found itself in the middle of a nightmare.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The city was cut off from the outside world, and the port operations ground to a halt as thousands of people found themselves surrounded by these suddenly violent creatures.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thank God for all those shipping containers at the port. The dock workers managed to stack them into makeshift walls around the perimeter in record time, creating an emergency defensive barrier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One container was about </span><span>10 feet</span><span> tall, and they'd stacked them three high&mdash;basically turning them into the height of a three-story building.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Karson Chapman, the CEO of Sunrise Group, was sweating bullets, pure terror written all over his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't wrap his head around where these monsters had come from. They seemed to have mutated somehow, showing zero fear of humans, acting incredibly aggressively, and attacking people on sight with a terrifying bloodlust.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why the hell did these damn beasts choose </span><span>Louvian</span><span> as their target?" he roared. "And where's our useless government? The police and security forces are completely worthless. I pay my taxes for this garbage?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Chapman, this is turning into a full-on beast invasion," one of his men called out anxiously. "We're surrounded, and these container walls aren't going to hold forever. What's our next move?"</span></p><div class="pagination">
