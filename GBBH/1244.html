  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Karson nodded before adding, "Mr. Hawthorne, besides those mutant monkeys, we've spotted some sketchy guys in black. Pretty sure they're the ones behind all these animal mutations."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander let out a cold scoff. "It has to be the Sakra Society. First, Yinson pulls his tricks in Loscity, now he's messing with Louvian Port."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry," he assured them. "As long as I'm here, Yinson won't get what he wants."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone felt their anxiety melt away. Alexander's mental power had grown so strong it could literally influence those around him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just his words had this weird way of boosting everyone's morale without them even realizing it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And that was just scratching the surface of what he could do. If Alexander ever reached the level of an elite Warrior, his every word and action would embody the fundamental rules of their world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that point, his powers would be indistinguishable from the miracles in ancient myths.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Of course, compared to actual gods, Alexander's abilities were still light-years behind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But we can't let our guard down," Alexander warned. "If the Sakra Society is plotting something behind the scenes, taking out all these mutant monkeys is gonna be a whole lot harder than we thought."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words left everyone deep in thought. The whole place went dead silent&mdash;not a single person dared to speak up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a while, Alexander waved his hand. "Augusta, go check those defenses. I want you to reorganize everything. Make sure they're rock solid."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"On it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Augusta and his team headed off to inspect the makeshift walls.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll come with you guys." Karson jumped in quickly. "Norah, stay here and keep Mr. Hawthorne company. Make sure he's taken care of."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, everyone was bustling around, leaving just Norah with Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne, I really can't thank you enough for today," Norah said softly. "I thought I was done for. Never imagined I'd make it out alive."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Norah's voice was surprisingly gentle and sweet&mdash;a total contrast to her fierce warrior appearance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry," Alexander said with a reassuring smile. "With me around, we'll get through this crisis in one piece."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Right then, Norah dragged herself over to the nearby steps and plopped down, letting out a massive yawn. She could barely keep her eyes open.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She'd been fighting non-stop since yesterday, and even though she was a metahuman with abilities far beyond normal humans, her body was completely wiped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander walked over and placed his hand on her shoulder, channeling the Force while giving her a gentle massage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Norah's cheeks flushed pink. She instinctively tried to stand up, but Alexander kept her firmly in place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get some rest," he said. "If you don't recharge now, you'll be running on empty when the real fight starts. That's just asking for trouble."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since this whole monster crisis kicked off, Norah hadn't caught a single minute of sleep. But now, with Alexander's warm energy flowing through her body, she finally felt safe enough to relax.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her eyes fluttered shut as she leaned against him, her curves fitting perfectly against his side. The subtle scent of her perfume drifted up to Alexander, making his heart skip a beat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From Alexander's position, he had an unintentional view of Norah's neckline, where her soft breasts rose and fell with gentle movements.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He cleared his throat and said, "Get some rest. We need to be ready for one hell of a fight tomorrow. But don't worry. We're going to make it through this. There are better days ahead of us."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words washed over her like a calming wave, lifting the weight from her shoulders. With a contented smile, she let her eyes drift shut.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It didn't take long for Norah to fall into a deep sleep, naturally curling into Alexander's embrace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was acutely aware of how soft and warm she felt against him, her gentle scent filling his senses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Desire stirred within him, but he kept it firmly in check.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mmm..." Norah shifted in her sleep as she felt something pressing against her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She immediately realized what it was, surprised that the usually stoic Alexander would have such an intense reaction to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For a moment, uncertainty flickered through her mind. But in the next breath, she turned and pulled him into a tight embrace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sexual tension between them was electric, ready to ignite at any moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their bodies pressed together, separated only by thin layers of clothing, like kindling waiting for a spark.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even through their clothes, they could feel the heat radiating between them, their skin burning with desire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wait!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Norah's hand slipped into Alexander's pants, he grabbed her wrist, stopping her.</span></p><div class="pagination">
