  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Alexander </span><span>came</span><span> out of the room, Ava and Lynn were asleep in each other's arms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I</span><span>t was already </span><span>midnight</span><span>. It was clear how intense the sex was between the three, which took several hours.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander drew a deep breath, feeling refreshed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Force, depleted by severe injuries, had largely been restored.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He came to the study and immediately contacted Augusta, Betty, and Cloe, as well as Brittany and Nancy, the leader of the Kaylon, who were far away in Kingsdon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were, at present, the most important subordinates of Alexander.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He started a video call, </span><span>and they answered it in one go</span><span>. The atmosphere instantly became lively.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Brittany, Ms. Tucker, have you ever heard of low-level energy cores?" Alexander asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upgrading the Lightsabers to Level 4 was a priority, but it required ten low-level energy cores.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brittany frowned and asked, "Low-level energy cores? Anyway, I have never heard of them. Wait a minute. I will ask my grandfather about it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, she temporarily muted her microphone and ran out of the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy made no reply. Instead, she stared at Alexander with a smile. Her expression was extremely charming and quite playful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne, you are really busy. I haven't seen you for a long time. It seems to be true that men don't cherish what they get..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander coughed, feeling very embarrassed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Augusta covered his mouth to hold back his laughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Betty and Cloe, with their complicated expressions, never expected that even Nancy was having an affair with Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Nancy, it's not that I am not going to see you. </span><span>Things just get complicated lately</span><span>... You know, I almost lost my life..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Alexander mentioned the assassination, Nancy immediately shed tears and ceased to trouble herself about her grievance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After pondering for a while, she said, "The Kaylon has a long history and influence all over the world, but we have never heard of low-level energy cores."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander, who had been full of expectations, was extremely disappointed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Brittany returned and shook her head repeatedly with a frown.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, my grandfather said that he had never heard of low-level energy cores</span><span> as well</span><span>. </span><span>And h</span><span>e </span><span>wondered</span><span> how you knew about such things."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's hopes of upgrading the Lightsabers were completely dashed.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even a high-ranking military official like Quentin said so. </span><span>He still had a long way to go</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He simply waved his hand. "Well, </span><span>then </span><span>forget it. Let's talk about the current situation!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yinson of the Sakra Society has restarted the Apocalypse Project and used the Immortality Serum to target important figures in various countries. Will they arrest him?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander glanced at Nancy and Brittany. Apart from Grace, they were the two closest to the powerful and wealthy, so they must know the inside story.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite being powerful, his Ultimate Alliance was a gangster force and was definitely not good at dealing with the powerful and wealthy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy sighed deeply and growled, "Things are not developing as you imagined. Yinson has used Immortality Serum to develop a diluted version of the strengthening potion."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander thought of the old man who had tried to assassinate him. He injected himself with an unknown red potion</span><span> </span><span>at that time, which must be the strengthening </span><span>potion Nancy mentioned</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy continued, "This diluted version of the Immortality Serum is colorless, odorless, and highly toxic and can cause serious diseases such as multiple organ failure, brain infarction, and myocardial infarction in normal people."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But the most terrifying thing is that this potion can revive the dead and maintain their consciousness for a period of time."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, now some of the top dignitaries long to get Yinson's potion instead of finding a way to arrest and punish him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Everyone will die. Having enjoyed all the wealth and pleasures of life, they desire not death, but immortality!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As far as I know, some of them have secretly made a deal with Yinson and have become his protector..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In annoyance, Alexander slammed the desk. He still underestimated human nature.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>During the fight</span><span>, the old man injected himself, which indeed turned him into a zombie, and then launched an even more violent attack on Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone's faces darkened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yinson, whose Apocalypse Project aimed to turn most of the world into eternal slaves, had made great strides in this direction.</span></p><div class="pagination">
