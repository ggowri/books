  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every general at the meeting wore a grave expression, their brows furrowed with concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The weight of today's discussion was crushing. After all, the future of humanity hung in the balance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The President's absence, explained away by a supposed illness, didn't sit right with anyone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quentin, in particular, felt uneasy about the excuse. Given that the President was in his seventies and came from an influential family with deep ties to the Ghost organization's leadership, there was a good chance he had already aligned himself with Yinson.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yinson's Apocalypse Project had two sinister goals. The first was to decimate the human population, turning normal people into controllable zombies who would serve as eternal slaves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The second was to gather massive amounts of experimental data to perfect the Immortality Serum, ultimately achieving eternal life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>An elderly man with white hair rose from his seat, his stern gaze sweeping across the room. His voice trembled slightly as he spoke, "Ladies and gentlemen, I'll cut straight to the chase. The situation has become critical, and I'm afraid I have some devastating news."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He paused before continuing, "This disaster has spiraled completely out of control, and we're severely understaffed. Due to the lack of cooperation from certain generals, we've only managed to secure the downtown areas of key cities, despite our best efforts.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The rest of our cities, including suburban and remote areas, have fallen completely. We've lost all control over those regions."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words sparked an immediate uproar in the room. Faces in the crowd displayed a range of emotions&mdash;some contorted with anger, others pale with fear. A few attendees were already gathering their things to leave the meeting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were one of Earthia's greatest superpowers, with a military force that ranked among the world's finest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The fact that they could only protect the downtown areas of major cities spoke volumes. The zombies and mutant beasts had clearly gained the upper hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As more humans fell prey to these creatures across other regions, the zombie numbers would continue to multiply, and the mutant beasts would form packs. Eventually, this would lead to terrifying waves of both undead and beasts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the two types of monsters poured in like a tidal wave, it seemed that nothing short of nuclear weapons could stop them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"God help us all," several generals muttered, bowing their heads in solemn prayer. The gravity of the situation weighed heavily on their faces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Everyone, quiet down!" the white-haired veteran bellowed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the highest-ranking officer in the command center, Marshal Byron had naturally taken charge of the situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had to raise his voice several times before the room finally fell silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Listen up, everyone." Byron's voice carried across the room. "We still have significant military strength at our disposal. According to our calculations, we have a million troops ready and willing to fight these monsters under our command."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He continued with determination in his voice, "We still have a chance. If we can mobilize another million fighters through general conscription and arm our civilians, I believe we can wipe these monsters out completely.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't forget about our numerous metahuman with their supernatural abilities. They're capable of going toe-to-toe with the most dangerous of these beasts. We've got combat exoskeleton and armor too. If we stand united and keep our heads, we've got a real shot at this!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Byron paused, his eyes sweeping across the room. "Even if we're destined to fail, we cannot let Earthia fall to these monsters&mdash;and sure as hell not to those treacherous bastards!</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Most members of the Ghost have betrayed humanity. They're so desperate for immortality that they'll stop at nothing to achieve it. They can't even be called human anymore. They're monsters themselves!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was murderous intent in Byron's voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone understood what Byron was implying&mdash;if pushed to the absolute limit, they would resort to nuclear weapons.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No matter how many zombies or mutant beasts they faced, a nuclear strike would wipe them all out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Byron's passionate speech helped lift everyone's spirits.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were reminded of their strength&mdash;they had an army of millions, cutting-edge weapons, metahuman soldiers, advanced combat exoskeletons, and battle armor. If they could just get organized, those monsters wouldn't stand a chance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Listen up, everyone." Byron's elderly but authoritative voice echoed through the command center. "I'm assigning missions now. When you receive your orders, I need each general to return to their base immediately. Get your troops and equipment ready, then move toward Kingsdon."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even with the President missing, these soldiers remained steadfast, fighting to protect their homeland.</span></p><div class="pagination">
