  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne, welcome!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Grace couldn't wait to jog towards him, her plump breasts bouncing attractively.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She showed a charming smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Hello, Ms. Lawson."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander smiled gentlemanly and gave Grace a gift box.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He said, "Happy birthday to you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Thanks!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Grace took the gift box with surprise, and while caressing it lovingly, she asked, "Can I call you Alexander?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Yes." Alexander did not refuse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this time, guests kept coming in and greeted Grace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, Gavin was in a very high position. And people wanted to curry favor with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Especially after the men saw Grace, they came over to chat with her enthusiastically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Grace had no choice but to give them a perfunctory response.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When she finally had some free time, she found that Alexander was missing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She asked, "Where is he? He's not leaving, is he?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Grace's face changed, and she looked around for Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She finally saw Alexander and discovered that he was eating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Lawson family prepared a sumptuous buffet, but everyone was busy socializing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Only Alexander was eating steak and drinking red wine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>There was a waiter next to him pouring wine and serving dishes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Who is this guy? Just now I saw Ms. Lawson welcoming him and thought he was some important person, but it turns out he is just a glutton!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"It's rude."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What a low-class fellow. He must be someone's poor relative."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Many people were talking about Alexander. They had just seen Grace being enthusiastic and intimate with Alexander, so they were jealous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Now, they seized the opportunity to mock Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Grace didn't think so. Instead, she felt that Alexander was not pretentious at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She ignored everyone else, sat next to Alexander, and watched him eat with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her clear and bright eyes were full of anticipation and tenderness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander just smiled and said nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Grace was the protagonist of today's party and the focus of everyone's attention.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She stayed obediently beside a man, watching him eat. Many men who had a crush on Grace were furious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Grace, Alexander, you are here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Suddenly, a familiar voice was heard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Madelyn?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander turned around and saw that it was indeed her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Madelyn, I haven't seen you for a long time. I heard that you are a lawyer now. Congratulations!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Grace stood up in surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The two women held hands and chatted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Madelyn went to Avalora to study law. She and Grace were schoolmates and good friends.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Afterward, Madelyn returned to Loscity, while Grace stayed in Avalora, and the two had less contact.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This time, Grace invited Madelyn to the party. The two hadn't seen each other for many years, so they were enthusiastic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>While chatting with Grace, Madelyn looked at Alexander with complicated eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Because of Alexander, Madelyn was not only the legal officer of the Brilliant Group, but also a partner of a law firm, becoming a famous lawyer in Loscity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Without Alexander's help, she wouldn't be where she is today.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But it had been a long time since the two had an intimate encounter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander felt a little uncomfortable being stared at by Madelyn. After their sex, he indeed ignored her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although it was consensual, he still felt guilty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Madelyn's eyes were full of resentment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She and Grace were standing together. They were equally beautiful. Madelyn was very sexy, which was more attractive than Grace's youthful appearance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Madelyn asked tentatively, "Grace, how did you get to know Alexander? I heard that your fianc&eacute; is coming. Asher, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Grace frowned and said unhappily, "Asher is not my fianc&eacute;, not even my boyfriend!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
