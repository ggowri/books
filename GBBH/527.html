  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why is he here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Brittany saw them, she showed an unhappy expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The green-haired young man was Harry Morris. He was her college classmate and had been pursuing her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brittany felt disgusted when she saw him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harry was a member of the Morris family. He was rich and powerful. Many women would come to him, if he wanted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Brittany was different. Not only was she the most beautiful and most charming woman he had ever seen, but she also didn't care about his money and status at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The more Brittany ignored him, the more Harry pursued her, vowing to get her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harry had a gloomy face. He never expected that he would run into Brittany dating a strange handsome man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were talking and laughing, touching each other's faces and hands. It was obvious that they had a very close relationship and might even have slept with each other.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harry was furious, thinking that his woman had been taken away. He wanted revenge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was burning with jealousy and glared at Alexander viciously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harry said, "Brittany, so you like this restaurant. I have a luxurious private room upstairs. Do you want to go there with me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brittany glanced at him coldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She said, "Go away. I don't like seeing you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing that Brittany was so disrespectful to him, Harry became even more furious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't be mad at Brittany, so he would have to take it out on a man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harry said, "Brittany, is this your boyfriend? He's dressed so plainly, he's probably not a successful person. Would your grandfather agree to your relationship?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What does it have to do with you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brittany looked disdainful, gave Alexander a piece of pizza, and said gently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She said, "Ignore this psychopath. Let's enjoy our dinner."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander agreed and ate with gusto.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harry was jealous. He looked at Alexander carefully with a fierce look.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said, "Hi, Brittany and I have something private to discuss. Can you give us a minute?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander looked up at Harry and said domineeringly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What do you want to talk to my girlfriend about? Just talk to me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brittany came over with a smile and kissed Alexander on the face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harry suppressed his anger and sneered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You don't deserve Brittany. Look at the difference in status. I guess you want her money. Tell me, how much money do you want to get out of here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, how much money can you give me?" Alexander asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harry suddenly became excited and raised two fingers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said, "I'll give you two hundred thousand dollars. Get out of here right now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Two hundred thousand dollars? That's a lot of money!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander said in a light tone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harry was excited and thought, "This guy was indeed a waste who had never seen the world. He only wants two hundred thousand dollars."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smiled, "Two hundred thousand dollars may not be enough. If you can give me two million dollars, I will agree."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harry immediately laughed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, Alexander still wanted money. But Harry felt painful to take out two million dollars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said, "Are you trying to blackmail me? I have money, but I won't be taken advantage of."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harry wanted to slap Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You bastard, you dare to blackmail us? Two million dollars. How dare you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The henchmen rushed forward and were about to attack Alexander, but were stopped by Harry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He found it very strange that Brittany was actually smiling and didn't try to stop them at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander snorted contemptuously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Didn't you say you were prestigious? You don't have two million dollars, but you still want me to leave?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Faced with Alexander's ridicule, Harry would not give in in front of Brittany.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harry immediately took out his cell phone and shouted angrily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said, "Two million dollars? I'll transfer the money to you right away. Once you take the money, get out of here right away!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a while, Alexander's mobile phone rang with a notification message. He really received two million dollars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He immediately took Brittany's hand and said with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's go to another place and give this table to him."</span></p><div class="pagination">
