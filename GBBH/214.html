  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aiden must be up to something. Alexander, you can't go."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Xavier suggested.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander pondered and said with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Since he wants to give me a top-quality gem, I should go. I just want to see what he's up to."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although ruby was not the core material of the Lightsabers, the best ruby was very valuable. Alexander might be able to use it in the future.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the church, a silver-haired old man was praying, with a tall black Shadow standing behind him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This Shadow was covered in a black cloak silently. If someone didn't see it, he would think that this person didn't exist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After the old man finished praying, he asked calmly, "Shadow, you said that Alexander has established his own power?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shadow said, "Yes, Godfather, Mr. Hawthorne violated the rules you set. He is not allowed to establish his own power without permission. This is a betrayal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"According to my observation, Ultimate Alliance has also established an unusual relationship with the Fraternity of </span><span>Loscity</span><span> and the Federer family. And its power has been expanding in secret.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"With magic powder as their economic foundation, Ultimate Alliance cannot be underestimated. Maybe one day it will become a serious threat!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shadow's voice was cold and ruthless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The old man did not say anything. After a moment of silence, he asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What about Augustine and Anthony?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shadow replied respectfully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Augustine Hawthorne and Mr. Anthony Hawthorne have not made any unusual moves recently. They were shocked by Mr. Hawthorne and are each planning some major action."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The old man sighed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I used to think that Alexander was from the lower class of the common people, had no future, and would definitely be killed first.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I never expected that he would have such ability and ambition... Never mind. He is my son anyway. If he can win the inheritance, he can do whatever he wants.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If he can't, no matter how hard he tries, it will be in vain, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The old man looked at Shadow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, Godfather."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shadow bowed and retreated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At noon, Alexander followed Xavier to the Ulysses house.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aiden had already prepared a sumptuous family dinner and was waiting for Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dad, what's wrong with you? He beat me and embarrassed me, but you actually invited him to dinner and said you would give him a top-quality gem. Are you crazy?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angelica asked indignantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aiden smiled bitterly with helplessness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My dear, our biggest enemy right now is the Carter family. The expert the Carter family hired is extraordinary. If we lose the competition, we will lose control of Gemstone Street.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Since he is so skilled, we can use him to deal with the Carter family. I'm forced by the situation and have no other choice."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angelica said, "Humph! I don't care. He beat me up for nothing. As my father, can you bear this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angelica started to cry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aiden panicked and said quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry. After he has dealt with the Carter family and is no longer of any use, I </span><span>will teach him a lesson and help you get revenge. How about that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angelica pressed on. "Are you still going to give him the gem?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aiden sneered contemptuously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Top-quality rubies are hard to meet, and they are worth tens of millions of dollars. I won't just give it to him casually. That was just a gimmick to lure him into working for our family. I will take it back."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angelica suddenly realized. "Dad, you are cunning."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, Alexander and Xavier arrived.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aiden came to them with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said, "Welcome. Your presence brings honor to our family!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander also said politely, "Thank you for your invitation."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aiden said, "Come on in!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aiden enthusiastically pulled Alexander to sit down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angelica snorted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She slammed her fork on the table.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How shameless! He came here immediately after hearing that there was food and gem."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angelica said in a sarcastic tone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aiden said quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne, I'm sorry. I have spoiled this girl. She is rude. Please don't mind."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It sounded like an apology, but in </span><span>reality</span><span> it was indulgence.</span></p><div class="pagination">
