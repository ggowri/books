"Now that the Saint Group has secured the exclusive distribution rights for the magic powder, the Brilliant Group's downfall is inevitable. Sebastian has no chance left in </span><span>Loscity</span><span>."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Remember your place, Alexander doesn't need you to </span><span>tell him what to do</span><span>, let alone meddle in his affairs!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Max's face turned red, and he fell silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Sebastian was lifted into the car, he shouted furiously at Alexander, "Alexander, don't get too cocky! The dark wizard, Mr. Flemming, will be in </span><span>Loscity</span><span> any moment now. We'll see who </span><span>wins the last round</span><span>..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the mention of the dark wizard, the atmosphere suddenly </span><span>tensed</span><span>. Everyone around looked at Alexander with a mixture of sympathy, worry, and a hint of </span><span>gloating</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mesco's</span><span> infamous City of Sorcery was a forbidden place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rumor had it that its wizards were divided into three ranks: gray wizards, dark wizards, and white wizards.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>White wizards, the highest level, were exceptionally rare, second only to the legendary King of Wizards.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The dark wizards, however, were the City of Sorcery's core strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though Alexander commanded respect now, if he couldn't withstand this coming challenge, he would inevitably face destruction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the ICU, Evan lay on his hospital bed, his face twisted with pain. The excitement and joy he'd once felt had vanished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Holding his head, Sebastian groaned and cursed, "We were way too careless. Who would've thought it was Alexander who developed the magic powder?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan suddenly erupted into maniacal laughter. "Ha! It's over. We're </span><span>done</span><span>..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tears welled up in Sebastian's eyes. "Evan, there's still hope. Mr. Flemming will be in </span><span>Loscity</span><span> tonight. He's a dark wizard. He'll heal us, capture Alexander, and seize the magic powder formula!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A glimmer of hope flickered in Evan's eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then he turned, glaring viciously at Andrew and Jane. "Are you two in league with Alexander? Did you bring in a scammer to lower our guard and make a fool of us?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Andrew, looking miserable, protested, "Mr. Sebastian Tate, Mr. Evan Tate, we're innocent! I was scammed out of forty million dollars by Jackson. That's our entire fortune..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Please, help the Fairfax family through this crisis. Can't you give us some business opportunities to help us recoup our losses?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing Andrew's request for money, Sebastian felt his head throb even harder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He suddenly leaped up, slapping Andrew across the face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Andrew stumbled backward, nearly falling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You fool! You think you can make money off me? </span><span>W</span><span>orthless trash! If it weren't for you tricking me, would I have lost so easily to that scoundrel Alexander?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm starting to think you're one of Alexander's spies, planting a fraud </span><span>against </span><span>me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian slapped him again, and Andrew's vision blurred.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All of Sebastian's frustration poured out on Andrew.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No! We're not spies; we were truly deceived... Mr. Tate, if you don't help us, the Fairfax family will be bankrupt by next month. We'll lose our home to the bank..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Andrew clung desperately to Sebastian's leg, begging.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get out! What does it matter to me if the Fairfax family goes bankrupt? You deserve it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian kicked him hard, sending Andrew rolling across the floor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane, watching in panic, cried out, "Mr. Sebastian Tate, we've done everything we can to support you. If you abandon the Fairfax family, who else will dare to work with the Brilliant Group in the future?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian seethed with anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You wretched woman! You brought a </span><span>fraud</span><span> here to deceive me, and you dare call it 'help'?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get these two pieces of trash out of here. If I see them again, break their legs!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At Sebastian's furious command, several men rushed forward, grabbing Andrew and Jane and dragging them out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, they lay battered and bruised on the street, abandoned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Our family is ruined!" Andrew wailed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Forty million dollars, an entire forty million! That damned fraud Alexander must've conspired with Jackson. They must've tricked us on purpose... Jane, </span><span>they did it deliberately, right</span><span>?"</span></p><div class="pagination">
