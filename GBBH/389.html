  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Present were Felix and several other high-ranking members of the Red Umbrella Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone stared at Felix in shock, and it felt like even the air had fallen into an eerie silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bernard started to panic, swallowing hard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Vanderbilt, I swear it's true... that's exactly what Alexander said..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix snorted coldly, about to say something, when Bernard suddenly collapsed to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah! My head feels like it's splitting... my body... the pain!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bernard felt as if he were being run over by a car, with countless sharp knives twisting inside his body, the pain unbearable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Help!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bernard's entire body convulsed as the intense pain reached its peak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blood began to ooze from his nose, ears, eyes, and even his pores. It was a terrifying sight that made everyone shudder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone was horrified as Felix jumped up from the sofa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Force Alexander had left in Bernard's body had activated, and the Force Destruction move wasn't just for show. It wouldn't end until Bernard was completely destroyed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Bzzz</span><span>, </span><span>bzzz</span><span>, </span><span>bzzz</span><span>!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, Bernard's phone rang, but he was in too much pain to answer it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix gestured, and someone immediately answered the call for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A cold voice came over the line.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bernard, you delivered my message to Felix, didn't you? Your time is almost up, so make peace with what's coming and savor the fear and taste of death."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Alexander!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The plan to use the Cripples to take down Alexander had failed once again!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix's face grew dark.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Please... save me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bernard let out a desperate scream, his body jerking violently a few more times before finally going still.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix looked at Bernard's corpse, his expression twisted with rage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, once I have your daughter, you'll be on your knees begging me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander returned home to find Ava playing a game with his daughter, Ashley.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hugging Ava from behind, he asked his daughter with a grin, "Ashley, is Ava nice?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes! I like Ava a lot!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ashley's eyes sparkled with joy as she hugged Ava and gave her a kiss.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander laughed happily; knowing that his daughter and Ava got along well put his mind at ease.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava felt Alexander's hand sneak under her T-shirt, her cheeks flushing red.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop that, Ashley's here! Behave, and I'll take care of you tonight."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She gently stroked Alexander's cheek.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander whispered in her ear, "Then I want to see you in some lingerie."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava rolled her eyes playfully, nodding shyly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander grew excited right away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I like lace, especially with a thong."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He gave her a playful squeeze before reluctantly pulling his hand back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava was breathing lightly, her face red again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Be good, and I'll give you a full-body massage tonight."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She couldn't resist slipping her hand inside Alexander's pants.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Alexander was about to hold her, Ava laughed and slipped over to Ashley's side.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ashley looked at Alexander, puzzled, wondering what game her dad and Ava were playing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander shot Ava a glare. She was a heart-stealing tease!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ashley, you play with Ava. I'm going to work."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Alexander headed toward the study, Ava suddenly said, "Ms. Hollister has been looking for you. She's the Saint Group's chairman's secretary and doesn't usually pay much attention to men. Do you happen to know the chairman?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander hesitated briefly, then smiled and replied, "I'll get in touch with her. You haven't met the chairman; how would a small fry like me know him?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava didn't respond, watching Alexander enter the study and close the door, a smile tugging at her lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Could he really be the chairman?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had suspected Alexander's identity of a while but had never asked him directly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's reaction just now made Ava even more certain. He was likely the mysterious chairman; otherwise, why would Alice show him so much interest?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Back in the study, Alexander felt a bit anxious, wondering if he should finally tell Ava the truth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Distracted by his thoughts, Alexander failed several times while carving an Esoteric Pattern, frustrated enough to toss his engraving knife aside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By now, night had fallen. Unable to settle his thoughts, Alexander decided to go find Alice for a talk.</span></p><div class="pagination">
