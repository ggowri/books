The number of level-two metahumans is unknown. Felix is a level-two metahuman, and there may be level-three metahumans as well."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was very calm, with no change in expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can only alleviate the cell phagocytosis mutation in Ashley's body, and I can only do so four times at most, which means her life will last for a month. Within this month, no matter what the cost, I will definitely find a way to restore Ashley.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You make the arrangements. I will secretly enter </span><span>Kingsdon</span><span>, and we must capture the leader first. Only by catching Felix can we completely solve the problem."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His tone was extremely firm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since Alexander had made up his mind, Alice knew that She couldn't change it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry, Mr. Hawthorne. I'll take care of everything!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this time, Alexander sneered, "How much money can I use now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alice thought for a moment and said, "The cash that can be mobilized immediately is over five billion dollars, and over ten billion dollars within 24 hours..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's enough!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander interrupted her and said firmly, "Take out ten billion dollars and offer a reward on the Dark Web for all the members of the Red Umbrella Group."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alice was shocked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, he said calmly, "Felix alone will get the one billion dollars' bounty. You can handle the other middle and senior executives. I want the Red Umbrella Group to collapse completely."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alice felt nervous and said carefully, "The Red Umbrella Group is not only as economically powerful as us, but also has close ties with the military. Felix is also a senior figure in the Vanderbilt family in Capital Region. If he also offers a reward to us, I'm afraid both sides will suffer..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A sharp light flashed in Alexander's deep eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Since they dare to hurt my daughter, I will not only kill Felix at all costs, but also destroy the entire Red Umbrella Group!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If ten billion dollars is not enough, then increase it to 20 billion dollars. If 20 billion dollars is not enough, then continue to increase it to 50 billion dollars, 100 billion dollars. Even if I have to sell the formula of the magic powder and the beauty ointment, I will destroy the Red Umbrella Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dad only said that I should be the only heir, but he never said that I must not destroy the Red Umbrella Group."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alice looked at Alexander in astonishment as if she was meeting him for the first time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's current aura was so terrifying that Alice even felt that he had surpassed </span><span>Godfather. He wanted to destroy the entire Red Umbrella Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one could compare to his momentum and dominance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, Alexander sneered, "Although the Red Umbrella Group has strong economic strength and the military as its backing, the military is also a hurdle that Felix cannot overcome. With the military around, he cannot use too much funds to fight against our bounty order."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alice was surprised.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne, you are amazing! Even if Felix raises funds to fight back, as long as we offer a reward for the magic powder, this trump card will definitely make the Red Umbrella Group everyone's enemy."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, with the bounty issued by Alexander appearing on the Dark Web, dozens of states, countless counties and cities, and even foreign countries were stirred up. A massacre plan targeting the Red Umbrella Group was brewing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shadow got the news first, and he was shocked and quickly reported it to Godfather.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander is so domineering. Great!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The silver-haired old man slammed the table so hard that the coffee cup jumped to the ground and shattered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander is indeed my son and does not care about money. It looks like Anthony is going to lose..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was a glimmer of relief in Godfather's eyes, but his wrinkled face showed deep sadness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, both Guzman and Felix were his sons.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shadow was silent for a while, then said in a deep voice, "Godfather, Mr. Anthony Hawthorne kidnapped hurt Ms. Ashley Hawthorne. He violated the competition rules and your orders. Shouldn't he be declared the loser directly..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Godfather waved his hand to interrupt him, "Anthony did disobey orders, but using any means necessary is also a kind of ability."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shadow couldn't help showing a look of astonishment and thought it was really hard to guess what Godfather was thinking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Godfather suddenly chuckled, "Alexander doesn't know that I am one of the major shareholders of the Dark Web, right?"</span></p><div class="pagination">
