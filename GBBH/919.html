Please forgive me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melin and the others were speechless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not only Melin and others were shocked, Elaine also never expected that Alexander could sneak into the base and rescue these people.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elaine secretly glanced at Yannick who was lying on the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now tell us how to eliminate the immortality potion and the living dead?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's tone was still cold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, sir."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elaine lowered her head respectfully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She said, "It's actually very simple. We can completely destroy the potion and the living dead with fire, or destroy the living dead' heads to kill them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"According to the decision of the Sakra Society and </span><span>Risun's</span><span> military, the Apocalypse Project will be implemented in half a year at most. The ultimate goal is to make </span><span>Risun</span><span> the world's hegemon and turn everyone into slaves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The base has a self-destruct device. Once the password is entered, it will explode."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander nodded with satisfaction. "Very good. Set the base to self-destruct in one hour."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melin and several police officers had serious expressions. It was finally coming down to the wire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had to escape from here before the base self-destructed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wait here for me. I will go and destroy the immortality potion first."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander took Elaine away again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Elaine's cover, Alexander had a smooth journey and entered the most heavily guarded computer room in the research center, where he destroyed all the research data.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, he went back into the storage room and used Force Burning to destroy all the potions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A shrill alarm sounded in the base. It was obvious that someone had discovered something unusual.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Go set the time for the self-destruction!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander ordered Elaine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't care if she lived or died.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander returned to the cell, holding several assault rifles and ammunition.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We will charge out. Kill anyone you meet!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander gave the order in a decisive tone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone picked up their guns. Their eyes were filled with murderous intent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander said, "Follow me and fight your way out. You must protect yourselves first."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He took the lead and walked out of the cell, leading everyone directly to the elevator entrance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was no longer hiding his strength. He killed anyone who stood in his way and shot them instantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under the leadership of Alexander, Melin and her companions not only killed people but also destroyed various equipment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Most of the glass coffins in the hall were destroyed by them. Disgusting green liquid flowed on the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander led Melin and the others to the elevator entrance, which had already alarmed everyone in the base.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A group of soldiers rushed over with weapons in hand, led by a colonel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The colonel was furious when he saw the bloody corpses all along the road and all the equipment destroyed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill them!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The colonel saw Alexander and immediately roared in anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So annoying!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander just fired a burst of shots without even aiming.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The colonel reacted quickly and dodged immediately, so Alexander's attack missed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander couldn't help but be surprised. This guy was quite strong and should have a second-level speed power. Otherwise, he would not have been able to dodge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The guns in Melin and others' hands fired.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Screams were heard everywhere. The soldiers behind the colonel fell in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fool!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The colonel was like a mad beast, attacking Alexander desperately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He burst out with all his strength at an incredible speed and crashed into Alexander hard.</span></p><div class="pagination">
