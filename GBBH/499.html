  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was a tall man named Shadow, with an upright stature. He was holding Dave's head with his left hand. Dave's eyes were wide open, filled with incredible fear and shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In his right hand, he held the heavy, dark, thick-backed machete, full of murderous intent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the dead silence, the only sound was Aaron and the others' rapid breathing and the sound of blood dripping from the knife.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one knew when Shadow had sneaked into the base and started killing people silently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The first person to die was Dave, and then those scientists were killed one by one by him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The pale light shone on the dark cloak, which was stained with blood left by the people he had killed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though he was killing someone, Shadow started answering the phone, obviously not taking Aaron seriously at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was also because of this phone call that Aaron and others were able to survive and were not killed immediately. It was not clear whether this was their fortune or misfortune.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Godfather, don't worry. I won't leave anyone alive!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, Shadow hung up the phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Two fierce gazes shone through the cloak, like the light of a sharp knife.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aaron felt a chill rising from the soles of his feet to his tailbone and then spreading throughout his body. He couldn't help but tremble all over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who are you? We, the Red Umbrella Group, have no grudges against you in the past or in the present, so why are you trying to kill us?" Aaron demanded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The eight metahumans were unable to stop Shadow, and Aaron's mental defenses were about to collapse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My name is Shadow. Lord Reaper has become impatient and ordered me to send you to hell as soon as possible."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shadow shook the machete in his hand, a bloodthirsty smile appearing on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You have no grudge against me, but the biggest mistake made by the Red Umbrella Group is that you should not have disobeyed Godfather's order and kidnapped the little girl.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anyone who disobeys the Godfather's orders shall die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aaron began to shiver uncontrollably as if he had just been pulled out of an ice hole.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are...you the legendary Shadow, the top expert under the Godfather...who once slaughtered 500 people by yourself in one night?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shadow nodded approvingly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, you have good eyesight. I decided to let you die more easily. Why don't you commit suicide? It will be less painful this way."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The murderous aura emanating from Shadow seemed to be real, locking onto Aaron.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lord Shadow, do we must die? If you promise to spare us, we can raise 100 million dollars for you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And we promise to leave the Red Umbrella Group, go abroad, and go far away. How about that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aaron was still making a final effort to survive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"One hundred million dollars?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shadow swung his sword in the air, and the sword's energy tore through the void, which scared Aaron.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, yes, 100 million dollars!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aaron looked at Shadow expectantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shadow sneered, "Stop talking nonsense. I'll give you one minute to commit suicide. Don't force me to do it. Otherwise, it will be more painful for you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aaron's expression turned resentful, and he stared at him viciously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shadow, do you really think you are invincible? There are eight of us, and you are </span><span>only one! We are metahumans, and you are not!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As long as the eight of us join forces, we can fight you. Do you really think we are weak?" Aaron shouted, and the others also became excited.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were all superior metahuman, equally ruthless in killing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's go together. I don't believe we can't kill him. Let's fight him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes! With so many of us working together, even if each of us bites him, we can kill him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They started clamoring loudly. Since Shadow was determined to kill them, it was time for them to fight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were still very confident in their abilities, and they all stared at Shadow fiercely, looking for opportunities to attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You still have 30 seconds to commit suicide. When the time comes, don't blame me for not leaving you with an intact body. This is all your own fault."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shadow's tone was confident and terrifying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aaron's face showed a murderous intent, and he waved his hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's go together! Kill him!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
