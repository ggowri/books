  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Over a hundred elite members of the Vance family were gathered here. Although individually, they were no match for Alexander, as a group, their presence was formidable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Asher believed that in such a situation, Alexander would have no choice but to retreat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Alexander didn't flinch. Instead, he smirked, radiating an air of unshakable calm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As the onslaught began, Alexander vanished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the blink of an eye, both the bullets and flying blades fell harmlessly to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The man leading the charge stumbled, nearly losing his balance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He had been sure he'd severed Alexander's head with a single strike, but now all he faced was empty air. His expression turned to one of shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ah!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A horrifying scream erupted from his throat as he looked down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His chest had suddenly protruded. Alexander had struck him from behind, piercing through his chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His ribs and sternum were shattered, and jagged bone fragments jutted out, tearing through his chest like a grotesque protrusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Blood poured out in torrents, and the force sent him flying through the air. He collapsed in a heap, everything going black.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With a thud, his body crashed into the crowd like a cannonball, sending people scattering. Cries of terror filled the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander moved through the crowd like a ghost. Each strike he delivered took a life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was as if he were playing a cruel game of dominoes. The second, the third... bodies fell into bloody heaps.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Within moments, Asher's men were scattered across the floor, lifeless and broken.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The members of Ultimate Alliance had joined in, surrounding Alexander and assisting with the onslaught.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In less than five minutes, over a hundred of Asher's men lay defeated on the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You... you're so strong. Why have you been hiding it all this time?" Asher stammered, trembling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>For the first time, he truly felt the sting of death. This wasn't West Cemetery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Back then, there had been figures like Gavin watching, so Alexander had refrained from killing him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But this was different. This was Ultimate Alliance's territory. If Alexander wanted him dead now, it would be as easy as killing an ant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Asher, you brought all this on yourself."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander's cold eyes locked onto him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Asher felt an overwhelming pressure, his bladder threatening to release.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He had always been arrogant, feeling superior, thinking of himself as a genius.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But now, standing before Alexander, he felt like trash.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Cold sweat drenched his body. His legs shook uncontrollably. He felt he was doomed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander walked toward him expressionlessly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The silence in the hall was deafening, broken only by the sound of Alexander's footsteps, each one like a hammer pounding into Asher's chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The murder in Alexander's eyes sent a shiver down Asher's spine, making every hair on his body stand on end.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Asher felt as though Alexander was an insurmountable abyss. Any moment now, he could be swallowed up and sink forever, unable to rise again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He lost all will to fight and bolted for the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But strangely, no one tried to stop him. As he neared the door with a look of wild joy on his face, Alexander swiftly kicked out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A knife flew up from the floor like lightning, piercing Asher's right leg.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ah!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A blood-curdling scream erupted as Asher crashed to the ground, his leg bleeding profusely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Vance..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A few Vance family members who had survived gasped, their faces draining of color.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They realized it was truly over. If Alexander showed no mercy to Asher, they were certainly doomed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander walked slowly up to Asher, looking down at him from above as though gazing down upon a beggar from a high throne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Asher lay there, writhing in agony and fear, his gaze locked on Alexander, his body drenched in sweat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The terror in his heart was overwhelming. All he could think of was surviving.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Alexander... I... I was wrong. Please let me go. I can apologize, I can pay you a huge sum of money. What do you say?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Killing me won't benefit you. If I die, the Vance family will definitely come after you. We could solve this though a better way, right?" Asher pleaded.</span></p><div class="pagination">
