  <div class="container"><p style="text-align:left;">Stephen sheathed his sabers, exhaling deeply.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Defeating three experts in succession had consumed a lot of his energy.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;You bastard, there aren&#x27;t so many &#x27;ifs&#x27; in this world!&quot; he sneered, looking down at Cesar with contempt.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Karson shouted, &quot;Come out and face him!&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Four gunmen burst into the room each wielding submachine guns trained on Stephen.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Laser lights flickered on Stephen, and gunfire erupted, the bullets raining down like a violent storm.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Cesar hadn&#x27;t expected Karson to have such a final gambit, but hope surged within him. Perhaps this surprise attack could actually bring Stephen down.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Karson believed that no matter how strong Stephen was, he wouldn&#x27;t be able to withstand such a barrage.</p><p style="text-align:left;">These four gunmen were elite; if they could seriously wound or even die with Stephen, it would be worth it.</p><p style="text-align:left;">However, as the gunfire erupted, Stephen unleashed his powers to their fullest.</p><p style="text-align:left;">He moved with the grace of a feline, his body more agile than a monkey and faster than a cheetah. He twisted and turned through the bullets, expertly slicing at one of the gunmen.</p><p style="text-align:left;">With a swift motion, he severed the gunman&#x27;s head, blood spraying everywhere. Before the body even hit the floor, Stephen dispatched the second gunman.</p><p style="text-align:left;">In mere moments, the last two gunmen met the same fate, their bodies cleaved in two along with their weapons.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Before Karson could even contemplate escape, his last resort crumbled, leaving him in utter defeat.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Alexander remained seated, observing the chaos as if he were watching a play unfold.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Stephen&#x27;s cold gaze locked onto Alexander. He found Alexander strange; he showed no fear and seemed to dismiss him completely.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Mr. Chapman, you squandered the two chances I gave you. Do you regret it now?&quot; Stephen taunted, advancing toward Karson step by step like a cat savoring its captured prey.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;I will never surrender! I will never be your slave!&quot; Karson shot back defiantly, slowly retreating.</p><p style="text-align:left;">The shadow of death loomed larger, and escape felt impossible.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Stephen chuckled darkly, &quot;I heard you sent your family away. It won&#x27;t save them. I&#x27;ll hunt them down one by one and kill them.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;You have a daughter about to start high school, right? I like chicks. I&#x27;ll make sure she knows you asked me to look out for her.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Stephen laughed lewdly, relishing the power he held, playing with his prey before delivering the final blow.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Suddenly, Cesar lunged at Stephen from behind.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Karson&#x27;s eyes lit with hope, and he charged at Stephen with renewed vigor.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Without even glancing back, Stephen simply threw his knife and sheath behind him.</p><p style="text-align:left;">With a cry, Cesar was swatted away.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Karson found his fist caught in Stephen&#x27;s grip. In the struggle, Karson felt his wrist twist painfully.</p><p style="text-align:left;">With a single kick, Stephen sent Karson sprawling.</p><p style="text-align:left;">He coughed up blood and fought to rise.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Though he stood in a position of power, he was afraid of death. Yet, faced with certain death, he found a surge of courage and resolve.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;You can kill me, but you can never humiliate me!&quot; Karson glared defiantly at Stephen.</p><p style="text-align:left;">His body trembled uncontrollably, but he steadied himself, refusing to back down in the face of Stephen&#x27;s murderous intent.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Stephen clapped slowly, a smirk on his face. &quot;Well done. No wonder you&#x27;re renowned in Louvian. But it&#x27;s a shame that you&#x27;ve chosen to go against Sakra Society. You&#x27;re sealing your own fate.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">In a swift motion, Stephen drew his saber.</p><p style="text-align:left;">The act was deliberate and slow, and his expression was gleefully mocking.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Just as Karson was about to be killed, Alexander&#x27;s calm voice cut through the tension. &quot;Stop, Stephen. Enough with your performance.&quot;</p><div class="pagination">
