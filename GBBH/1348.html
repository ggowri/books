  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Alexander stepped out the door, he hadn't gone far when a Risunese approached him, nodding with a smile. "Mr. Hawthorne, Mr. Burkart is waiting for you in the west wing."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright," Alexander replied, following the Risunese down the hall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After walking for a while along a beautifully decorated corridor, they arrived at a series of rooms. Zamir was standing at the entrance. The Risunese gestured for Alexander to enter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander exchanged a quick glance with Zamir, silently confirming that everything was fine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon entering the room, they were met with a screen, behind which sat Arturo, Reece, and Raylan, each with a half-naked woman in their arms, sipping wine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander made his way to an empty seat next to them, cursing inwardly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Arturo looked up from the woman's chest and chuckled, "Mr. Hawthorne, you here! Isn't she a beauty? Where did she come from?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander realized that Arturo thought he slept with Isolde.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He narrowed his eyes and smirked, "Oh, she's definitely something special. She told me she was from the palace. She sneaked out with a maid for a little fun and ended up being here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Reece had a wicked gleam in his eyes as he said softly, "You're lucky, Mr. Hawthorne. She really is something." He tightened his grip on the woman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Raylan leaned in to kiss the woman in his arms and teased, "Mr. Hawthorne, drinking alone is no fun. How about something more exciting? Risunese women are the best! You could..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Alexander had an idea. He casually pulled a small medicine bottle from his pocket and held it in his palm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Everyone, I'll bring that woman over. I still need to have some real fun!" he said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Arturo and Reece's faces lit up with excitement, both urging him, "Hurry up, Mr. Hawthorne!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander stood up, stepped outside, and placed the bottle on the small table in front of the screen. Holding his breath, he quietly closed the door behind him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zamir and the Risunese were standing guard on either side of the door. Alexander looked at the Risunese with a cold stare and instructed, "Mr. Burkart and Mr. Glozier are in a private discussion and cannot be disturbed."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, Mr. Hawthorne," the Risunese replied with a bow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Zamir, come with me," Alexander said, and they hurried toward the guest room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, at the foot of Walgus Hill, Zain held the hilt of his sword, frowning. "Where did Alexander go? Around here..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Troy thought for a moment and suggested, "Mr. Dunne, there's a Walgus Church further up the hill."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Walgus Church? Alright! Let's check it out!" Zain decided, leading the group toward the church.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander pushed the door of the guest room open to find Isolde happily munching on cakes while sitting on the bed. He sighed, "We need to run away."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Run away?" Isolde asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Running away means escaping!" said Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I see!" Isolde replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Zamir, you're coming with us. Arturo is a level-four warrior, and I can't take him on. As for the other women, we'll just have to wait for the folks from Darwin Court to rescue them. They should be here soon. We need to leave now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zamir hesitated, saying, "But they won't let any priests or women leave the mountain!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Leave that to me. Arturo and the others are preoccupied for now," Alexander assured him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He led them straight to the mountain gate, where two Risunese stood guard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a friendly smile, Alexander approached them. "Mr. Burkart asked me to..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two Risunese, Riggs and Misael, bowed and said, "Greetings, Mr. Hawthorne!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as the two Risunese looked up, Alexander sprang into action. The Force within him surged, and he moved like lightning, his hands transforming into claws as the sound of wind and thunder crackled around him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a swift motion, he grabbed the Adam's apples of Riggs and Misael&mdash;one on each side&mdash;and released a burst of Force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a muffled thud, the two Risunese collapsed to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's eyes sparkled as he sprang into action, delivering punches and unleashing the Force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In just a few months, he had already become a level-three warrior. What a genius!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once they were off the hill, Zamir took the lead as the three of them made their escape from Walgus Hill.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Two hours later, the two Risunese were arguing loudly at the entrance of the west wing.</span></p><div class="pagination">
