  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn you, stop running!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stephen's eyes were bloodshot with rage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He no longer kept track of how many moves he had made. It was far beyond three by now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After unleashing everything he had, his body was drenched in sweat, but he still couldn't land a single blow on Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, Alexander stopped dodging.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the sharp blade light came slashing down, Alexander stood motionless in place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stephen's joy surged. He poured all his strength into the blow, aiming to sever Alexander's head with a single strike.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Swish!" A faint sound rang out as Stephen's saber snapped cleanly in two.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander revealed his Lightsabers. Since becoming an Advanced Warrior, this was the first time he had unsheathed his sword.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Lightsabers' blades emitted a soft glow, dazzling but not blinding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This... This is impossible!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stephen stared at the two broken saber blades in his hands, utterly stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These were precious swords, crafted with great effort by </span><span>Risun's</span><span> most renowned swordsmith, capable of effortlessly slicing through iron.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And yet, they were shattered by Alexander's single strike!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's impossible?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander scoffed, casually flicking his wrist. The Lightsabers disappeared into thin air and were tucked back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stephen, I no longer need weapons. Go ahead, use whatever moves you have left. If this is all you're capable of, I'm truly disappointed."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's expression was filled with mockery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You dare mock me? Die!" Stephen roared with fury, swinging his broken saber in a </span><span>wild rush toward Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Trash! Killing you is as easy as flipping a switch!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's tone turned frigid, and in an instant, the Force exploded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He quickly moved, leaving behind a blur as he passed Stephen by in a flash.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stephen seemed like a game character whose pause button had been pressed. He stood frozen, unmoving, his eyes filled with shock and disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Alexander was smiling, turning to face Stephen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The silence was deafening, the air seeming to freeze in place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Karson and Cesar swallowed hard a few times their nerves palpable as they stared intensely at them. They couldn't tell who had ultimately won the battle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stephen collapsed heavily to the ground and made a sound, the broken saber blades rolling away from him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes were wide, almost bulging, as he glared at Alexander with a mixture of shock and rage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only then did Karson and Cesar see the full extent of Stephen's injuries. His hands were twisted into bizarre shapes, completely crippled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill me, coward! Just kill me!" Stephen howled in agony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Alexander walked slowly over to him, looking down from above with a calm demeanor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tell me, where is Yinson hiding? If you help me find him, there might still be a chance for you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hahaha..." Stephen let out a sinister laugh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Want me to betray Mr. White? Dream on! Spit on you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He spat in Alexander's direction, but Alexander easily sidestepped it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's expression turned even colder as he stomped down on Stephen's right leg with force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you going to talk?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The shrill scream that followed was horrifying as Stephen's leg bone snapped under the pressure, and he writhed on the ground in agony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I won't say! I'll never tell you! Kill me!" Stephen still stubbornly refused to speak, glaring at Alexander with murderous intent as if he wanted to tear him apart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander nodded approvingly. "Not bad. Loyal to Yinson. You're a good slave. But now, let's see just how stubborn you are."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stepped on Stephen's other leg, replicating the same crushing action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stephen fainted from the excruciating pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Earlier, he had sworn to cripple Alexander and turn him into a useless person. Now, Alexander had turned the tables and fulfilled Stephen's wish, except in reverse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Karson snapped out of his daze and quickly moved to Alexander's side, fawningly saying, "Alex, leave this guy to me. I'll interrogate him properly and get everything he knows out of him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander nodded. "Fine, it's up to you now. I don't care about his life or death. I just want to know where Yinson is."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry. I've got it covered!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Karson made a quick call, and soon, a group of his subordinates rushed in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These were Karson's backup forces, now put to use.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cesar, feeling ashamed, couldn't bring himself to look at Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before, he had been so arrogant, pretending to be impressive in front of Alexander. Now, he realized just how foolish he had been. It was nothing short of a joke.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander didn't bother with him, offering him no more than a passing glance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Chapman, the matter is settled. I'm heading back to </span><span>Loscity</span><span> now. Let me know as soon as you have news about Yinson."</span></p><div class="pagination">
