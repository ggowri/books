  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The four bodyguards staggered to their feet, clutching their chests in pain. Their faces were flushed with the sting of defeat. With heads bowed in a mixture of respect and embarrassment, they acknowledged Alexander.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mr. Hawthorne, we have failed."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander offered them a smile, saying, "Forgive me. My words were not well-chosen earlier."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The quartet was left in a state of bewilderment, but their admiration for Alexander grew by the moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You losers. Now, you see the might of Mr. Hawthorne? Leave, now!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Anne's cold voice cut through the air.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Without a word, the four retreated with respect.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Anne couldn't suppress a sigh of admiration.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mr. Hawthorne, you're truly remarkable. Their loyalty has skyrocketed."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander waved dismissively.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Save the flattery. Go and uncover the assassin's whereabouts.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Prepare for tomorrow night's ball. I want Ryan and Jane to experience a night they'll never forget!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"As you wish, Mr. Hawthorne," Anne replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her confidence was bolstered by witnessing Alexander's prowess.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She believed Alexander undoubtedly had the potential to become Godfather's true heir!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Following this, Alexander first visited his daughter outside the intensive care unit before returning to the villa to meditate.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">For a true Warrior, the path to righteousness lay in the pursuit of strength.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Powerful strength was the true safeguard and foundation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Meanwhile, Ryan sat in his wheelchair. His face was devoid of emotion. His legs were as lifeless as wood, devoid of sensation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A thorough examination at the hospital had revealed no abnormalities beyond the superficial injuries from his fall.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ryan was more convinced than ever that Alexander was versed in witchcraft and had cursed him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jane was attempting to reach Billy from the Wolf Gang, curious about how he had managed to hospitalize Alexander.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Despite multiple calls, Billy did not answer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jane boasted, "My dear, even Billy dares not answer my call. He must fear I'll demand repayment."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ryan snorted and looked sullen.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What I want is to capture Alexander and lift the curse, not to hospitalize him."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jane hastened to reassure him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"My dear, worry not. Tomorrow, you'll be the vice president of the Saint Group. With a word from you, how could a mere Alexander escape?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ryan's expression softened at these words.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jane lovingly caressed the gold-embossed invitation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Honey, tomorrow night, we'll truly become the new elite in Loscity!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She nestled excitedly into Ryan's arms while her hand instinctively reached for his crotch.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ryan was stunned. Since his legs had been crippled, he had lost his normal male functions, a fact he was too embarrassed to voice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Hey! What's wrong? Honey, why aren't you responding at all?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jane looked at Ryan, puzzled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ryan had never been like this before. No matter the time or place, he would pounce on her like a wolf at her slightest flirt.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Though his legs were now an issue, there was nothing wrong with his dick.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Guiltily, Ryan pushed her away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'm not in the mood for sex now. Let's wait until I'm the vice president."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jane found it odd but didn't dwell on it, instead trying to comfort Ryan.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The two of them envisioned the grandeur of the ball the following night, picturing themselves as the center of attention and standing at the zenith of their lives.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">*****</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Time flew, and soon, another day had passed. Tonight, the Saint Group would host a grand ball.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">All the major families and corporations had received invitations and were preparing for the event.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Beyond Ryan's ascension to vice president, the new chairman of the Saint Group garnered more interest.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This enigmatic chairman had risen to power quietly, and no one had ever seen their true face, nor did anyone know their gender.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Yet, Alexander paid no heed to these matters. He focused solely on his meditation, yearning to enhance his strength and swiftly advance to the intermediate level.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As Alexander delved deep into his meditation, his cell phone suddenly chimed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He had set up a call-blocking system; only a select few, like Lily, Anne, and Ava, could get through at this hour.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander inquired, "Are you feeling better?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lily replied, "Alexander, Sir Fairfax just contacted me. He wishes to meet you..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After absorbing the tale spun by Lily, Alexander frowned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The Sir Fairfax that Lily had mentioned was none other than Jane's grandfather, Frank Fairfax. Frank had been one of the few in the Fairfax family who had treated Alexander kindly when everyone else looked down on him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, since his divorce from Jane, Alexander had no intention of visiting the Fairfax Villa again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Shortly after ending the call with Lily, Alexander received a call from Frank.</p><div class="pagination">
