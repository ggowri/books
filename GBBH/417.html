  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ella opened the closet door proficiently as soon as she entered inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The closet was filled with a wide variety of sexy erotic suits, which were all extremely sexy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She blushed and picked out a short white lace dress and quickly changed into this short dress that Felix loved so much.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The skirt was in a small size, and it was transparent. Ella didn't have to bend over at all to show off her hips and legs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ella gently touched the lace on the short skirt, which was made of silk with embroidery, and it was so smooth that it felt like an extra layer of delicate skin on her body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thought of what she was about to suffer later filled Ella's heart with shame, but she also felt a vague sense of anticipation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ella was in a daze for a few moments before she came to her senses, and she hurriedly </span><span>put on her heels and left the changing room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Ella walked into the study, she was immediately startled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix had stripped down, and he was sitting naked on the sofa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were whips, candles, handcuffs, and other odd props on the large table.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There you are."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix stared at Ella's perfect body as the desire burned in him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had been in a bad situation lately, and he was a bit dissatisfied in his mind, so he needed to vent his anger properly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ella responded softly, keeping her head down and not daring to look at Felix at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although she had surrendered to Felix's threat and hadn't thought of resisting, the skirt did make her feel uncomfortable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Besides, Ella could guess the purpose of those things on the table, so she was apprehensive and trembling uncontrollably.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ha-ha-ha, what are you looking at? Sure enough, you're a lustful bitch. Are you just going to try me now? Are you out of control?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix laughed smugly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It embarrassed Ella even more that he humiliated her so directly, and she wanted to find a hole to crawl into and hide.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix came up behind Ella and hugged her gently, coming up to her ear and murmuring, "Count the hours. Your addiction should be kicking in, right? Do you want to enjoy it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ella seemed like a poor little sheep. She was pressed down by a fierce tiger and was completely unable to resist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had indeed become intolerable, and her whole body was as if there were countless ants crawling all over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Master, I want it..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ella's defenses instantly collapsed, and she voluntarily kissed Felix.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, I knew you were a slut."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix smiled and actively avoided it, and he sat back down on the sofa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The drug you are taking is so expensive, which is the latest product that the Red Umbrella Group has developed based on the magic powder. Not only does it give you supreme pleasure, but it's so addictive that you'll never get rid of it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You should thank that asshole, Alexander. If you can get the recipe for the magic powder, I can increase the effect of this medicine more than ten times!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"By then, this new type of magic powder will take over the whole world, and everyone will have to submit to me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix bragged smugly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ella turned pale, and her mind went blank.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Master, I can't stand it, and I feel terrible. I'm willing, I'm willing to accept everything you ask... Please reward me with some medicine, okay?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix crossed his legs and watched with great enjoyment as Ella begged for mercy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Since you are so obedient, let me see your determination. My beautiful kindergarten teacher, you should have learned to dance, right? Dance for me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, Master."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was as if Ella was possessed and did not resist at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She knew what Felix meant by dancing. What he asked for was definitely not a normal dance but a sexy one.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Ella had nothing but thoughts of getting high and obedience in her mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was no longer the same person at all but a woman who was addicted to drugs and lust.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ella started dancing to the music, doing all sorts of sexy dance moves, and she was completely intoxicated by it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Not bad. You're a nice bitch to develop..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix grinned and admired her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing such insulting words, Ella unexpectedly didn't get the slightest bit angry but instead became even more obsessed with it.</span></p><div class="pagination">
