If you don't want to drag the Federer family down with you, just take the easy way out."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gary was furious, glaring at him menacingly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You want me to </span><span>kill myself</span><span> for the sake of the Federer family? Edward, you idiot, do you even know what you're saying? I am the head of the Federer family, representing </span><span>its dignity and prestige!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The hall was filled with murmurs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Over a hundred people are missing.
