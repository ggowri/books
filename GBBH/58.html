  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava said calmly, "Isn't your grandson a doctor of medicine? Can't he cure you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She looked at Vincent next to Oscar, and the latter blushed with shame.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Oscar smiled awkwardly and said helplessly, "Ms. Blackburn, I admit that I was wrong. Please go to see Alexander with me as soon as possible. I feel awful..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay, Sir Stewart. Since you trust my boyfriend so much, I'll go with you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava finally agreed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She took the opportunity to teach Oscar a lesson and let him know that there were always people better than his lot.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When Vincent heard that Alexander was Ava's boyfriend, he frowned with jealousy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">They went to the hospital to see Alexander.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Meanwhile, Ashley's surgery had been completed, and she was sent to the intensive care unit.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander went home and made chicken soup for his daughter, who could drink it after the anesthetic wore off.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Oscar and the others failed to find Alexander in the hospital, so they hurried to Bevery Hills to look for him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Open the door. Open the door quickly!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The guys from the Kaylon thumped at the door frantically, but no one came.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Oscar got anxious and asked Ava quickly, "Where is Alexander?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava shook her head and said, "I don't know. I'll give him a call."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She soon got through. After a few brief words, Ava hung up the phone with a complicated expression.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Where is he?" Oscar asked impatiently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava smiled and said, "He is making chicken soup at home. He asked you not to disturb him and wait a moment."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Oscar turned sullen.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His muscles were stiff, and his whole body hurt as if it were being pricked by needles. The situation was extremely urgent, but Alexander actually dared to ignore him because he was making chicken soup?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Vincent couldn't bear it and shouted angrily, "Grandpa, why do you have to see him? I don't believe he can cure Parkinson's disease. That's absolutely impossible."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Shut up! You can't cure me. Alexander is my only hope now."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Keep knocking on the door until he opens it," Oscar yelled madly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The people from the Kaylon immediately started banging on the door again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava neither stopped them nor said that she knew the password to open the door. She wanted to see how Alexander would deal with them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Bang, bang, bang.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Open the door quickly. We are from the Kaylon."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The people banged on the door and shouted loudly, but no one responded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The door was solid, and they couldn't do anything to it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In a blink of an eye, more than ten minutes passed, and Alexander was not seen, let alone open the door.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Oscar suddenly felt extremely desperate and painful like a deflated ball.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"This guy is obviously playing a trick on me. He didn't open the door on purpose..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Vincent was fuming with anger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Grandpa, don't beg him. Alexander must be a liar. I'm a doctor of medicine and have never heard of anyone who can cure Parkinson's disease."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava glanced at him contemptuously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Your ignorance can't prove anything. You underestimate the others just because you're a doctor. My boyfriend's mysterious abilities are beyond your imagination."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Vincent was unconvinced. When he was about to refute, Oscar stopped him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Stop talking... You can't even cure my illness. How can you question others here?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Alexander is my only hope for recovery. Do you want to go against me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Vincent was baffled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Everyone waits here until Alexander opens the door!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Oscar gave a firm order.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The group of people finally fell silent, standing blankly at the door of the house.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After waiting for at least another fifteen minutes, Oscar could no longer bear it. His right hand, which had been shaking constantly, shook several times more frequently with anger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Finally, Ava called Alexander again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After a while, the door finally opened, and Alexander came out calmly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Vincent shouted abuse, "What the hell are you doing in there? Didn't you hear us knocking on the door?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander instantly became colder.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Nothing can stop me from making chicken soup for my daughter even if the sky falls. If it weren't for my girlfriend, I wouldn't have come out to see you so soon."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Oscar flew into a rage.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He trembled and pointed at Alexander. "Stop talking nonsense. Come and cure me. If you fail, I'll make you miserable."</p><div class="pagination">
