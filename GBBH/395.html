  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eugene smiled in agreement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, yes, three drinks, and everything's forgiven. I believe Mary is loyal to us. She'd never betray us over someone like Alexander."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mary frowned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm sorry, but I can't drink anymore. How about I apologize with water instead?" Mary suggested.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she spoke, Mary raised the cup.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Crash!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lawrence swung his hand forcefully, knocking the cup from her hand and smashing it to the floor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Enough with the excuses! If you won't drink, then come upstairs with me. If you could sleep with Alexander, you can sleep with us!" Lawrence snarled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lawrence growled menacingly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eugene smirked silently, clearly having planned everything with Lawrence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Heh heh..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The other Blood Gang members looked on with glee, enjoying the scene.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this, Eugene urged, "Mary, Lawrence here represents the Godfather. Showing your respect with a toast, and you still won't drink three glasses?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now that the Blood Gang serves the Mafia, your refusal is disrespectful to the Godfather. If he gets angry, you won't be able to handle it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The others quickly joined in, agreeing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mary, if you keep refusing, it's on you. We won't side with you if Lawrence loses his temper."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Exactly. Lawrence has already spoken. It's just three drinks. It'll settle things between you two nicely!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Right, it's just a bit of alcohol. What's the hesitation? Or would you prefer to make amends in a room upstairs? Ha </span><span>ha</span><span>!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Maybe Mary's been lonely and wants to join us all upstairs!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their eyes roamed over Mary with leering, malicious delight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mary, as the branch leader in </span><span>Loscity</span><span>, had once commanded their respect, though they were envious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But with Eugene and Lawrence backing them now, they were each taking their chance to corner her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mary's once-cheerful face turned ashen as she realized she was trapped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She knew she couldn't drink these three glasses. She'd never make it out of the hotel. Luckily, she had sent Alexander a text for help.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In all of </span><span>Loscity</span><span>, he was probably her only hope.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To buy time, Mary smiled and said to Eugene, "Mr. Griffin, as a member of the Blood Gang, if I'm forced to drink and word gets out, won't it damage the gang's reputation?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eugene laughed mockingly, ignoring her completely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing her refusal, Lawrence slammed the bottle down in front of her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You think you're someone important? Even your gang boss would show me respect. You'll drink whether you like it or not!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mary trembled with anger, Alexander's face flashing through her mind. He was her last hope.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now it's not just three drinks. You'll drink this entire bottle, or I'll pour it down your throat!" Lawrence threatened viciously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tears welled in Mary's eyes; without the Blood Gang's protection, she had fallen from her position of power to a mere nobody.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eugene watched, amused, a cold smile on his face, already plotting his next move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Lawrence grabbed Mary and was about to force the bottle into her mouth, a chilling voice echoed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop! You dare force my woman to drink?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, the air seemed to freeze as the room fell silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone turned, wide-eyed, to see Alexander stride into the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They all recognized Alexander, but none of them had expected him to show up here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lawrence sneered, saying, "Mary, looks like you really are involved with Alexander. You tipped him off, didn't you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eugene laughed as well. "Brilliant as always, Lawrence. Using this harlot, Mary, to draw Alexander out. It worked perfectly!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bang!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lawrence slammed the table and pointed at Alexander, shouting, "You think you're fit to play hero? I've been waiting to trap you all along!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, a group of burly men flooded into the room, surrounding Alexander.</span></p><div class="pagination">
