  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alyssa felt like a fish on the chopping block, utterly at their mercy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You scum! If you dare drug me, Alexander will make you pay for it!" she spat through clenched teeth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despair welled up within her; escape seemed impossible, and she feared the torment that awaited her at the hands of these two degenerates.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Scum, are we? Ha! You got that right. Just wait and see how scum like us handle you," Woodrow sneered, a twisted grin spreading across his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He reached into his dark robe, pulled out a small vial, and waved it in front of Alyssa's face. "See this? My own special concoction&mdash;just a few of these, and any woman will feel a desire like no other," he laughed, shaking the vial. "Take a few doses, and you'll turn into a nympho with an insatiable appetite. You know what that means, don't you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The implications left Alyssa pale. The idea of succumbing to such a fate was worse than death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing her face turn ashen, Kerwin smirked with satisfaction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Starting to reconsider? This is your last chance to make a smart choice."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alyssa stayed silent, jaw tight with defiance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She would never betray the Axe, nor would she betray Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kerwin's expression darkened at her continued resistance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fine, if that's your choice, then you can just embrace your new life," he sneered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Turning to Woodrow, he clapped him on the shoulder. "Triple the dose. Let's make sure she's hooked right away."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Woodrow grinned, nodding. "Don't worry, I've got it covered."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're despicable! Cowards!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alyssa's voice trembled with rage as she cursed them, her body shaking as she struggled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her defiance only seemed to fuel their depravity, their eyes hungrily taking in every move she made.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Toying with her, Woodrow slowly unscrewed the vial, letting a few of the small red pills spill into his palm. He approached Alyssa with deliberate slowness, his grin widening with each step.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alyssa clenched her jaw, fighting the urge to scream, though her mind spun with desperation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The only hope that remained was that somehow, someone would find her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Alyssa thought it was impossible for that to happen. Her subordinates would never be able to find her here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Alexander's car had stopped just a hundred yards from the crumbling old castle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stepped out, taking in the eerie quiet and the decaying stone walls of the fortress before him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was deathly still, with only the chirping of insects in the nearby trees.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Scanning the ground, he spotted Alyssa's faint footprints leading toward the castle's entrance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He surveyed the area one more time, finding nothing amiss, then silently approached the castle, keeping to the shadows.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inside, Alyssa felt on the verge of breaking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Woodrow, holding the pills, approached with an evil grin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His movements were slow, filled with mockery, and Alyssa's mental defenses were on the brink of breaking down. Fear and despair hit her like a crashing tide, each wave more overwhelming than the last, battering her will.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it were a woman with weaker resolve, she would have likely been screaming in madness or passed out from fear by now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though Alyssa was the leader of the Axe and had strong willpower, facing the horrifying prospect of becoming a woman assaulted by countless men, she simply couldn't accept it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Woodrow sneered at her, dangling the pills tauntingly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Relax. Once you've taken these, you'll feel only pleasure. Men will line up to make you happy."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With an air of false generosity, he gave her one last chance. "Or, you could join us in taking over Mandale Town, and help us bring that bastard Alexander to his knees. What do you say?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get lost!" Alyssa shouted defiantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fine, fine. No need to shout. You'll be screaming soon enough anyway."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Woodrow scratched his ear, looking displeased.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He put his face in front of Alyssa's plump chest, so close that he was almost touching it, and then took a deep breath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah, you smell incredible," he sneered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Woodrow showed an expression of great anticipation, staring at the pair of unusually plump breasts, his blood boiling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"With a body like this, I could play with you for months and never get tired. And I bet it'll get even bigger over time."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Disgusting!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alyssa spat at him.</span></p><div class="pagination">
