  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Frederick, you can offer a billion dollars as a bounty, but it doesn't matter if you don't have the strength to kill me!" Alexander said, his gaze icy as he stared down Frederick.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Frederick's face turned livid. He now realized that numbers wouldn't win the day against Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Initially, he had believed that surrounding Alexander with sheer numbers would give him the upper hand, that he'd find an opening to strike.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was wrong. The bodyguards flanking Alexander were fierce, coupled with a handful of snipers making his skin crawl.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If I don't take Alexander out quickly, what will happen when the snipers take aim at me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gritting his teeth, Frederick unleashed a powerful aura. A swirling vortex of energy erupted around him, stirring the air like a tornado.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the blink of an eye, he vanished from sight, flickering erratically as he closed in on Alexander, his movements almost impossible to track.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A chill filled the air, the kind that sends shivers down one's spine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The broken sword in Frederick's grasp was once again aimed squarely at his nemesis. This time, he was determined to strike with even more ferocity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Alexander remained unfazed, standing there with his hands clasped behind his back, an expression of cold indifference plastered on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Alexander so nonchalant sparked a wildfire of rage within Frederick. With a fierce shout, he lunged forward, unleashing dozens of rapid strikes with his sword, the gleaming blades slicing through the air like beams of light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They converged to form a dazzling net, aiming to ensnare Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Morris family members </span><span>watched,</span><span> eyes wide with anticipation. "Surely Mr. Frederick Morris is about to deliver a fatal blow to Alexander!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But just as the shimmering sword strikes were about to connect, a sardonic smile crept across Alexander's face, and a strange light flared in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Force Confinement was activated again. Suddenly, time itself seemed to be slow, almost as if someone had hit the slow-motion button on a video.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One frame at a time, Frederick's movements became sluggish and drawn out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Alexander moved like a blur.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His Lightsaber flashed, piercing toward Frederick's chest with deadly precision.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah!" Frederick's agonizing scream echoed through the air as the blade plunged through him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His body gave in, the broken sword slipping from his fingers and clattering to the ground. Frederick was powerless, his heart punctured, blood gushing from the wound, leaving him gasping painfully for air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh no! Mr. Frederick Morris has been defeated!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The panic spread among the Morris </span><span>family,</span><span> their expressions frozen in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In their eyes, Frederick was invincible. A martial arts master whose skills were unparalleled; not even a level-three metahuman like Barry could touch him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet here he stood, completely outmatched, his heart effortlessly pierced by Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Silence fell like a heavy shroud over the scene.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's Lightsaber radiated an eerie brilliance, casting an imposing shadow over everyone present.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had never witnessed a weapon that gleamed so brightly, resembling an elongated tube of blinding light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From a distance, Felix watched, his fists clenched tight, a wave of utter helplessness washing over him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He mused, "Is Alexander truly an unstoppable force? Is this really his true power?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crafty Felix was the first to turn on his heel, sprinting for safety.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He poured every ounce of energy into fleeing, desperately hoping to put as much distance between himself and Alexander before he was noticed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a casual flick of his wrist, Alexander sent Frederick crashing to the ground like a meteor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dust billowed into the air as Frederick stared wide-eyed, unable to tear his gaze from Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a foot planted firmly on his head, Alexander pressed down, treating him like mere refuse underfoot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One by one, the members of the Morris family buckled under Alexander's oppressive energy, collapsing, unable to control their bodies in the face of such overwhelming power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They begged silently for Alexander to spare Frederick, cold sweat soaking their clothes, droplets hitting the ground like lost hopes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander..." Frederick gritted his teeth, forced to lie flat against the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Regret coursed through him, a bitter realization of the monster he had chosen to provoke.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If only he hadn't stood by Felix's side and stirred up this hornet's nest, he could have comfortably ruled as the head of the Morris family, living a life of wealth and ease.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But it was too late for that now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander looked down at him with a sneer. "Frederick, do you have any last words?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Frederick's expression twisted with anguish; his voice strained as he struggled to respond.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I concede! I'm sorry! Please, Mr. Hawthorne, spare the Morris family..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Faced with such a terrifying force, Frederick, once so self-assured, finally admitted defeat in front of everyone.</span></p><div class="pagination">
