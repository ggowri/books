  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, Ava and Alexander walked out of the building, hand in hand, laughing and </span><span>talking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once they got into the car, Tim waved his hand excitedly. "Follow them, but make sure they don't see us."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Alexander drove, he kept an eye on the rearview mirror; the van behind them looked suspicious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rebecca blushed and said, "The company has a hot springs resort doing a soft opening. Let's relax there today, and we can pick up Ashley from the hospital together tomorrow."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander felt a surge of excitement. First, for the chance to enjoy the hot springs with Ava, and second, because his daughter was finally getting discharged tomorrow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He felt like he had been waiting an eternity for this day to arrive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The resort was over an hour away from the city, and as Alexander chatted with Ava, he kept an eye on the van following them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The van kept its distance, but it was definitely tailing them!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander chuckled to himself. There were only three groups still challenging him now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was either the Red Umbrella Group, the Mafia, or the Clifford family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>An hour later, a large, beautiful complex appeared ahead, and the scenery was stunning and serene.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A light mist from the hot springs drifted in the air, swirling like clouds around a mountain lodge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Here we are!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After stepping out, Ava took Alexander's arm, beaming as she led him inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander glanced back; the van had pulled up some distance away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Security guards were stationed at the entrance of the resort, so whoever was following wouldn't try anything obvious and would likely wait for a chance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Alexander thought things over, he took in the elegant and refined decor around him, radiating understated luxury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Various antiques and paintings were displayed throughout, adding a rich cultural ambiance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava blushed and said, "The private hot spring is just up ahead, and it's just for the two of us."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Heh heh..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander grinned, resting his hand on Ava's shapely backside and gently stroking it. He could see every inch of her stunning figure with his All-seeing Eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though they had already been close, the thought of the hot springs made Alexander eager.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava led him down a stone path to a round spring, steam rising gently from the water.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nearby were bottles of red wine, various drinks, and an array of fine snacks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander couldn't help but admire it, "This place is fantastic."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was clearly Ava's first time here as well, and she nodded with satisfaction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's change into swimsuits and have a nice, long soak today."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander took off his shirt first, revealing his toned, muscular physique.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava clearly understood what Alexander meant, and her cheeks turned pink.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She quickly turned around, swaying her hips as she went to change into her swimsuit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava opened her bag, revealing several sexy bikinis, each one more stunning than the last.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clearly, she'd chosen them with Alexander's taste in mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't stall. Hurry up and change," Alexander called, relaxing in the hot spring.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Coming, coming... what's the rush? You're such a troublemaker!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava picked out a black three-piece bikini and began changing right in front of Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thin strips of fabric and slender ties barely covered Ava's full, alluring figure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's eyes widened, fixated on the enticing scene before him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her perfect S-curve figure, smooth pale skin, and full, shapely body revealed itself before Alexander like a peeled banana.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's breathing grew heavier as he reacted instinctively.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was their first time being so close outdoors, with bright sunshine and the warmth of the hot springs adding a whole new feeling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava adjusted her exceptionally full chest, causing a ripple effect that would make any man stare.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, Ava strutted over to Alexander, swaying her hips like a model.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're such a tempting enchantress!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander couldn't help but praise her; despite being close to many beautiful women, Ava stirred his desires the most.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What are you staring off into space for? Come here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava beckoned him over with a playful finger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander snapped out of it, reaching out to touch her without any hesitation.</span></p><div class="pagination">
