  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What wish? Go on, spill it," Fiona asked, her brow furrowed in confusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Oswald Borden, the young man, stammered, "I've never slept with a woman before. If </span><span>I die now, I'd really be kicking the bucket without having lived..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you kidding me? </span><span>So</span><span> you want to sleep with me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fiona's face flushed crimson as she yanked him by the collar, pinning him against the wall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fiona, I'm sorry! If you're not interested, that's fine. I wouldn't force you," Oswald stuttered, clearly shaken, his body trembling slightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Listen up, Oswald. We're not dying today, and you better not be a coward and run off!" Fiona warned him fiercely, her expression serious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fiona, please don't misunderstand! I'm not going to run away... Just trust me, alright? I'm genuinely worried about dying without ever having been with a woman. That would mean my life as a man was all for nothing!" Oswald grumbled, pushing her away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You little punk! I thought you were my buddy, and here you are thinking about sleeping with me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fiona pressed him against the wall again, their bodies uncomfortably close.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To his surprise, Oswald felt a physiological response kick in. Unable to help himself, he squeezed Fiona's soft chest, marveling at the delightful sensation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you trying to be a perv?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fiona's anger flared as she swiftly snatched up the knife, placing the blade against Oswald's neck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sharp edge broke the skin, a bead of crimson blood oozing out due to the tension in the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oswald, I've seen guys like you before&mdash;young, impulsive, and utterly unreliable. Don't even think about taking advantage of me, or I swear I'll gut you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fiona glared at </span><span>him,</span><span> her eyes fierce.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I get it, I get it! I messed up, okay? Just let me go, and don't let anyone see this! Please, hear me out!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Oswald's back was soaked with cold sweat, and he shivered at the precariousness of their situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just promise me you won't act like a creep again!" Fiona reiterated, though her tone softened a bit, her cheeks still flushed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fiona, I messed up. I thought I might die today, and I have feelings for you, so I blurted out that request... Please don't be mad. I won't say anything like that again."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Oswald sighed, a look of despair washing over his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, Fiona's expression softened. She lowered the </span><span>machete</span><span> </span><span>and pushed him aside, but she remained alert, the weapon still poised for action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a moment of silence, Fiona suddenly asked, "So, do you really like me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Oswald's face turned </span><span>red as a beet</span><span> as he leaned closer, sounding almost pitiful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fiona, I do like you... I even dreamed once that we got married."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fiona's cheeks burned at the unexpected confession, her heart racing as she struggled to steady the </span><span>machete</span><span> </span><span>in her hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fiona, I know you probably think I'm beneath you. Are you going to hit me now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Oswald sighed, resignation creeping into his voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had finally voiced what had been on his mind, but Fiona remained quiet, her </span><span>expression unreadable as she seemed lost in thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ugh, Fiona, I knew you'd look down on me. If you want to hit me, just go ahead. I promise I won't fight back..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ha!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fiona burst into laughter, quickly covering her mouth to stifle the sound, afraid it might draw attention from others nearby.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her curvy body shook with mirth, causing Oswald to lick his lips involuntarily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, Fiona yanked him close again, her demeanor turning serious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Listen here, kid. Looks like you've really grown up, thinking about women and all. Did I spoil you too much when you were younger? I'm eight years older than you, you know!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Eight years older? So what? I like mature women like you," Oswald retorted, rolling his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Little brat, I think you're just gaga. That's why you're saying you like me&mdash;trying to sweet-talk me into bed," Fiona teased, her tone light but her gaze had taken on a more serious edge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, can't you want to sleep with a woman you like? I think if you really like someone, you'd want to be with them, body and soul," Oswald said confidently, not an inch of doubt in his voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fiona found herself momentarily speechless, her cheeks turning an even deeper shade of red.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Oswald had a point, and deep down, she knew it. She wasn't exactly hard on the eyes&mdash;her sun-kissed skin, curvy figure, and the aura of a mature woman all added up to something undeniably attractive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing her quiet, Oswald sensed his chance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a sudden burst of boldness, he pounced forward, wrapping his arms tightly around Fiona.</span></p><div class="pagination">
