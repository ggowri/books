  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Wallace, Felix called again, urging us to deploy troops to protect the Red </span><span>Umbrella Group's executives and researchers," the man reported, cautiously watching Francis' expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh? Protecting their executives and researchers. That's at least a few hundred people. Do they think the </span><span>Kingsdon</span><span> Military Zone is their slave?" Francis sneered, full of disdain and anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Wallace, if the Red Umbrella Group suffers severe losses, it may affect the military's metahuman program. Could the military blame the </span><span>Kingsdon</span><span> zone?" the middle-aged man asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Francis let out a cold laugh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ha, I know you've taken Felix's money, so no need to threaten me with reminders like that," he said, cutting him off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man started to tremble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, no... I didn't take his money... I am thinking of your best interests, Mr. Wallace," he stammered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, Juliet leaned close to Francis and whispered a few words into his ear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Francis nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Juliet, send out a special forces platoon to secure the Red Umbrella Group's headquarters, and then have Felix meet me," he ordered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, Mr. Wallace. I'll take care of it right away," Juliet said, walking out confidently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Francis glared at the man. "What are you still standing here for? Get out now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, yes, I'll leave right now," the man replied, stumbling out of the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander had made up his mind to get to </span><span>Kingsdon</span><span> as quickly as possible to settle the score with Felix.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rock Rossetti, the High Elder of the City of Sorcery, offered to help treat Ashley, but only if Alexander handed over the Ancestral Witch's Cane and the Spirit Bead Bracelet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander wasn't planning to give up the Cane or the Bracelet; the consequences were far too unpredictable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His sharp eyes filled with killing intent as he watched the private jet descend.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, Ava hugged him tightly from behind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feeling Ava's warm embrace, Alexander's fury subsided.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ava, if there's any trouble with the Saint Group, go to Betty. She'll help you, no questions asked."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay. Don't worry, do what you need to do."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava nodded, a complicated look in her eyes as she glanced at Betty, the Ultimate Alliance members, and Alice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If she guessed correctly, Alexander was that mysterious chairman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sensing her thoughts, Alexander smiled and gently touched her cheek.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're probably wondering who I really am. Don't worry, when I return from </span><span>Kingsdon</span><span>, I'll tell you everything."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava didn't say a word, only held him tighter, as if trying to become one with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Betty, Alice, and Rosalia looked at the two with envy, feeling jealous. They knew they could never match Ava's place in Alexander's heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A few medical personnel rushed Ashley, still unconscious, toward the plane.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosalia and Alice quickly followed, carefully scanning the surroundings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander needed to use Force to heal his daughter every week, so he was taking Ashley to </span><span>Kingsdon</span><span> with him, just in case.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment he couldn't see his daughter, he felt uneasy and vulnerable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Goodbye!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander waved one last time as the plane door closed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava, Betty, Marvin, and Logan all looked up, watching the plane disappear into the clouds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the plane, Alexander checked on his daughter's condition. Though she wasn't awake, she was stable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He called Cloe and Augusta by satellite phone, instructing them to gather their forces to drive the Red Umbrella Group out of Treasure Island for good.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright! Finally, the day has come," Augusta replied, thrilled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both Augusta and William were ecstatic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had been taking down Red Umbrella members and seizing power elixirs all over the island.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They meditated daily using Alexander's techniques to avoid the elixir's side effects and had successfully advanced to level-two metahumans.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Augusta had become a level-two speed-type metahuman, now capable of easily dodging machine gunfire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>William had developed a rare firearms ability, enhancing both the power and precision of his weapons.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had become a terrifying marksman. A deadly force with his quick draw, impeccable aim, and enhanced bullets.</span></p><div class="pagination">
