  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"He died too quickly. Otherwise, we could have interrogated him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander's tone was icy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Such a top killer had solid willpower, so Alexander never thought of controlling him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He was just a killer, so if he died, he died, just like an ant being stepped on, and no one would care at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was not until this moment that Norma, whose pretty face had turned pale with fright, began to show a hint of redness on her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ms. Walsh, Sean first asked Benjamin to destroy your casino and then asked the Killer King who ranked at the top of the killer list to assassinate you. He wants to kill you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>What Alexander said was the truth, and he was not trying to sow discord.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Damn Sean! I won't let him succeed!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Norma was so angry that her whole body was shaking furiously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The frightened bodyguards finally came to their senses. They quickly called people to clean up the scene and expanded the protection circle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The continuous gunshots had alarmed many gamblers. If Alexander had not acted in time, there would definitely be a riot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne, thank you so much. Please come with me. I would like to discuss cooperation with you in detail."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Norma's expression was solemn, her eyes revealing a determination and a hint of murderous intent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before, Norma was a charming and beautiful woman, but now she had been like a tigress.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander was delighted. It was good that the Dragon Gang was in internal strife, as it would be easier for him to control the entire gang.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The two then walked towards the office together.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Norma hugged Alexander's arm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander immediately felt the fullness, softness, and elasticity of her breasts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Along the way, the bodyguards and people in the casino were deeply envious of Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Norma was their dream lover. Not only was she pretty and sexy, but she was also the leader of the Dragon Gang.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Any man who got her would definitely change his fate and become a bigwig in Risun.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander put his arm around Norma's slender waist. Norma, who used to be proud and cold, didn't say a word and just leaned against him obediently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Facing the gazes of others, Alexander glanced around and snorted in displeasure, which frightened them so much that they immediately woke up, quickly bowed their heads to apologize, and dared not look again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At the end of the corridor, Norma's office was here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After entering, Norma closed the door and locked it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She blushed and said, "Please sit down and wait for me for a while... Don't go... I'll go inside to change my clothes and then talk to you..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Norma's pretty face was flushed with shyness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This was the first time she was so open and bold with a man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You... Please don't come in..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander chuckled and said, "Ms. Walsh, you are reminding me that I will go in when you change your clothes, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Oh, no, I didn't. You got me wrong..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Norma blushed even more, but somehow, she felt sweet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She pushed Alexander to sit on the sofa, then twisted her hips and walked into the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander's prowess was evident, so Norma was resolved to ally with him no matter what to strengthen her stance and eliminate Sean.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The office was so quiet at this time that even a leaf falling to the ground could be heard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander activated the Force, and his vision penetrated the room and saw Norma who was changing clothes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Come on. What kind of clothes is she changing into?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He saw Norma taking several sets of sexy clothes and putting them on the bed, including bikinis, very revealing erotic suits, and some seductive uniforms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Moreover, these clothes were very new and had obviously never been worn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander supposed that Norma was still a virgin, but he didn't know why she would collect these things.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Norma had started looking in front of the mirror, choosing the clothes that best suited her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander narrowed his eyes, and many restricted and charming images emerged in his mind, all of which were of Norma's sexy and seductive appearance after she put on these clothes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon, Norma began to take off her clothes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander crossed his legs and admired the scene with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the meantime, Norma thought of Alexander outside, her pretty face flushing, and her breathing gradually became rapid.</span></p><div class="pagination">
