  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander sighed with a bitter smile, suddenly feeling a bit uneasy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava was the person he loved most, and he would definitely form a family with her in the future.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But once they were truly married, what about the other beautiful women, like Rebecca, Nancy, Brittany, Grace, and the others?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The images of each of these beautiful women flickered in his mind as if they were fighting for his attention.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For him, he wanted them all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At times, Alexander had fantasized about whether it would be possible to be with these beautiful women forever. How happy would he be in this life if that were the case?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Alexander was very clear-headed. Except for women like Betty and Rosalia, whom he controlled using the Force, other talented women would probably eventually leave him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rebecca, Nancy, Grace, and Brittany, each of these women came from prominent families and had strong abilities. Compared to Ava, they wouldn't be content to play second fiddle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clearly, these women were deeply in love with him, but if they were to spend their entire lives with just one man, none of them would likely be able to do it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For a moment, Alexander felt a pang of melancholy, unsure how to face that day.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, what are you thinking about? Are you upset?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rebecca asked with concern, her gaze filled with worry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Nothing..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Alexander could finish speaking, Rebecca interrupted him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She placed her hand over his mouth, smiling gently, "Right now, you're not married to Ava yet, are you? I still have a chance. Maybe one day, I'll be the only one by your side."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rebecca's playful smile made it seem like she was genuinely happy about the thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You've been running around a lot lately, working hard. Let me read something to you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She reached over to a small table nearby and pulled out a small book.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander glanced at the cover. It was a best-selling collection of essays, mostly about travel experiences and life reflections. It was quite popular lately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rebecca opened the book and began reading aloud in a soft, gentle tone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her voice was light and tender, like a cloud floating in the air or the sweet song of a golden oriole.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The fertile field of the soul may only be cultivated once. After one bountiful harvest, it will endure a long winter. When spring returns, if those who come after cannot sow </span><span>seeds into the fertile soil, they will only watch it wither away...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But there's no need to regret. A life that has known harvest is a perfect life..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander couldn't help but smile bitterly. Was Rebecca telling him that as long as she had experienced the happiness of being with him, that was enough for her?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Around the pool, only they remained. The bodyguards dared not intrude. It was very quiet, with only Rebecca's voice echoing in the stillness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander leaned back on the lounge chair, eyes closed, his body relaxed. It was as if he were sleeping, yet at the same time, it seemed like he was listening intently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, her reading stopped, and Alexander felt a hot, fiery body press against his.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The beautiful, lush lips of Rebecca, so soft and warm, tightly met Alexander's, beginning a deep kiss. They intertwined, both of them lost in the embrace...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It felt like an explosion had gone off inside Alexander, leaving only the intense burning desire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With one hand, he rubbed Rebecca's plump breasts through the bikini, and with the other hand, he reached between her legs and pressed the bikini into her seductive depths.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah... Alexander, you are so bad..." Rebecca hummed softly and closed her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander tore off the bikini bra and held her white breasts with his hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Baby, I was just listening to you reading. It was you who seduced me. How can you say I'm bad?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he started kissing and caressing Rebecca.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah... no... wait..." Rebecca blushed and said, "I need to use the bathroom. I'll go to the restroom first."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She knew that he would bring her intense excitement, and she didn't want to pee in a messy way, which would be really embarrassing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As a result, Alexander became even more excited. He held her and wouldn't let her go. He touched her all over, kissing and caressing her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rebecca felt embarrassed and annoyed and could only force herself to hold back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, let's go inside. We can't stay here, or we'll be seen by Ava and Lynn..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smiled and said nothing. Since Ava took her mother away, it was obvious that she was giving him a chance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, Alexander had already discovered that they were hiding on the balcony on the second floor and peeking at them.</span></p><div class="pagination">
