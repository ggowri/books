  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Frieza looked down at the two short men arrogantly and said, "I wouldn't have come if it wasn't for Carlos. They're so vulnerable. Cedric, Misael, you two go and raid their camp tonight and crush them in one fell swoop!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two Risunese men replied in agreement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Late at night, a crescent moon hung in the sky. The faint, cold moonlight shone on Hero Gorge. With surrounding strange rocks and eerie trees, the place seemed even more gloomy and terrifying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cedric and Misael led the way, followed by a dense mass of shadowy figures. They stealthily approached the camp of the Hrodvik army.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cedric hesitated and asked, "Misael, Frieza isn't from our country. Where on earth did he come from? Why does he look so strange?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Misael's eyes flickered, and he said in a low voice, "Don't ask about this again. I heard Frieza was invited by Carlos. It's said that Frieza is the heir of Devil Cult."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were two dim lights at the entrance of the camp. Several sentries, propping up their long spears, were drowsy. The camp was in darkness. It seemed that everyone had fallen asleep.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill them!" Suddenly, shouts of killing rang out. When the few Hrodvik sentries saw hordes of Risunese charging toward them, they dropped their spears and turned to run into the camp.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing this, Cedric laughed, "Misael, we're sure to achieve great feats today!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Misael smiled, "Don't let your guard down. Leave Fermin to me. I've been eager to challenge him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All the Risunese charged into the camp. However, after entering the military tents, they didn't find anyone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, a series of shrill screams rang out. Some stepped on caltrops, and some fell into traps...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn! We've fallen into a trap!" Cedric shouted. "Retreat! Retreat!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, the entire camp was ablaze with light. Countless torches were lit, and shouts of killing filled the air. The Hrodvik soldiers in the camp swarmed out and charged towards the Risunese.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the lead was Fermin. He wore bright silver armor, held a sword, and rode a roan horse. He waved his sword like a spinning windmill.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Behind Fermin were Alexander and Fermin's three sons. They held their weapons and rode horses. Any Risunese who came close to them either died or was badly injured. There were streams of blood everywhere.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Behind the Risunese, another loud shout was heard. A group of soldiers charged in from outside the camp, blocking the camp gate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The leader was Moses. He held a tiger-headed spear and waved it. The blood of the Risunese splashed everywhere.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Misael knew that he was in a perilous situation today. His face turned ferocious, and he shouted, "Cedric, for the Emperor of Risun, for the glory of Risun, let's fight to the death!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Misael drew the two sabers, stomped his foot, and charged towards Fermin. A pure stream of internal energy shot out from the top of his head like a column of smoke. Invisible circles around his feet, like rippling waves, attacked the Hrodvik army.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A fierce light flashed in Alexander's eyes. He thought, "This Risunese has such powerful internal energy. He's a level-five warrior!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fermin let out a great shout. A column of internal energy and smoke shot out from the top of his head. He soared into the air from the horseback. The purple protective energy around his body surged. His figure traced a strange arc. He held his sword and waved it. There was a loud cracking sound. The sword, as if splitting heaven and earth, came crashing down towards Misael's head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Misael roared. His figure swelled, and the veins on his arms bulged like coiled dragons. With the two sabers, one long and one short, he made a cross-cut in the air. A huge, invisible cross-shaped internal energy, accompanied by a piercing air current, blasted toward Fermin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a deafening bang, the place within a dozen feet of the two of them instantly became like a living hell. Bodies, both friend and foe, lay everywhere, and the blood flowed like a river.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fermin and Misael fought fiercely, and for a moment, it was hard to tell who had the upper hand. They were evenly matched.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cedric drew his saber, wanting to step forward to help Misael to surround Fermin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, a jet-black steel alloy rod reached his back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fuck off!" Cedric shouted. He waved his right towards the ground, and a puff of smoke rose. He disappeared in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, a long and narrow saber, glinting with a frightening cold light, slashed straight at Alexander's neck from the side.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Risun's fighting skill. Alexander was surprised. He snorted and leaped and turned like a nimble ape. The steel-alloy rod in his hand, glowing with protective energy, whistled through the air and struck straight at Cedric's waist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Cedric sneered. Without any obvious movement, he flashed strangely and disappeared again.</span></p><div class="pagination">
