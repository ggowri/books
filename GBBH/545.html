  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The waiters all fixed their eyes on Nancy, who was pretty yet aloof.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although the men present were attracted to her, none of them dared to strike up a conversation with her, and they just peeked at her furtively.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You finally came out. I thought you were going to regret it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the sight of Alexander, Nancy grinned brightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She dropped down her wine glass with a bang, and her breath reeked of a strong smell of alcohol. It was obvious that she had drunk a lot before coming.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander approached the bar and gazed into her eyes quietly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I have brought the Kaylon Pill. Are you sure you can help me cancel the marriage?" Nancy asked coldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smiled, "I am 100% sure that you cannot castrate me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy couldn't help laughing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was sometimes sharp-tongued and sometimes surprisingly humorous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't take what happened last night seriously. It was consensual, and remember, I was the one who took the initiative!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy was stubborn and arrogant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander asked, "You took the initiative? Didn't you beg for mercy under me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shut up! I didn't!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy blushed and rolled her eyes at Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He shook his head helplessly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Women are competitive, especially the beautiful ones."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is the Kaylon Pill. Here you are."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy took out a delicate little wooden box containing a small black pill.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander caught a whiff of the strange fragrance of the Kaylon Pill and asked joyfully, "How should I use it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy explained calmly, "It needs my blood and the dragon bone fragment passed down from the Gomez family in </span><span>Kingsdon</span><span> to fully exert the effect of the Kaylon Pill."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander asked, "Dragon bone fragment? Are there really dragons in this world?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy nodded affirmatively.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course, there were dragons in the past, but they are extinct now. The Gomez family is a wealthy family in </span><span>Kingsdon</span><span>, and they are not short of money. The dragon bone fragment has been passed down thousands of years ago, and they will definitely not sell it to you!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"However, the family head's daughter, Elaina Gomez, has a strange disease and has seen countless doctors but to no avail. If you can cure her disease, there will definitely be hope of getting the dragon bone fragment."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy raised her eyebrows and glanced up slightly with a cold expression, as if to say, "I have already told you everything, but what happens next has nothing to do with me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Strange disease? It won't be a problem for me," Alexander smiled confidently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After he became an Intermediate Warrior, his Force Sense and Force Cure grew stronger, and he was not really afraid of any incurable disease.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you so confident?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy gazed at him in surprise, as if it were their first meeting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll treat Elaina right away and be back soon."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander strode outside excitedly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you just leaving like that?" Nancy was anxious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander rushed away. Nancy couldn't catch up with him and stamped her feet in anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the distance, an old man who looked like a housekeeper stared at her and then in the direction where Alexander had disappeared and muttered to himself in confusion, "Could this be the fianc&eacute; that she mentioned?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He seems too ordinary, totally unworthy of the Kaylon. I have to go back and report to the master."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Next to the housekeeper stood a young man with a stern face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was dressed in casual clothes and sneakers, which were stained with a lot of dirt, </span><span>giving him a rustic vibe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the housekeeper was very respectful to him, so the young man was definitely not an ordinary person.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said with false composure, "Anyone who dares to steal my wife will be killed!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as he finished speaking, the ground crackled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The hard concrete road beneath him suddenly began to show dense cracks, like a huge spider web.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Gomez family in </span><span>Kingsdon</span><span> was a leading figure in the pharmaceutical industry. They owned hundreds of hospitals all over the world and controlled powerful medical resources.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Orlando Gomez, the family head, was the descendant of a famous doctor and had excellent medical skills.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately, even he couldn't cure Elaina and could only sigh every day.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander soon arrived at the gate of the Gomez Villa, which was crowded with men and women.</span></p><div class="pagination">
