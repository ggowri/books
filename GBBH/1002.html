  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliot shouted, "Ava, you don't get a say in this! Tell Alexander to come out and hand over the formula to me. Maybe I'll put in a good word for you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His voice dripped with arrogance. It was a bare-faced threat. He knew the Vance family had already bought someone inside the Brilliant Group to poison the magic powder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava wasn't stupid; she understood exactly what Elliot was trying to do. He was going to use public outrage as a lever to force Alexander to give up the formula.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian had likely been captured by the Vance family. They'd only release him and clear the magic powder if the formula was handed over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If not, the reputation of their magic powder would be in ruins. The Vance family's plan was ruthless, diabolical even.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If Alexander doesn't show up, you can sign on behalf of the Brilliant Group and hand over the formula for free. Sign it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliot waved his hand, a smug grin spreading across his face. One of the goons behind him immediately pulled out a document and thrust it toward Ava.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava didn't even glance at it and retorted, "Not a chance. You're dreaming if you think I'll sign that!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliot sneered, his confidence brimming over, "Oh, so you don't want to sign? Fine. Just remember, if you don't, the magic powder's reputation will be in the gutter. Who's going to buy it then, huh? All your distributors will sue you, and you'll be watching the Brilliant Group go bankrupt."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava laughed coldly, grabbed Elliot by the collar, and scolded coldly, "You and the Vance family are playing a dangerous game. There'll be hell to pay!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ava, I suggest you keep your cool. If you so much as harm a hair on my head, who knows what might befall Lily or Ashley," Elliot argued, his voice dripping with sarcasm. An evil smirk played on his lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're absolutely shameless! Don't you dare think about hurting Lily or Ashley!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava's blood ran cold, and her face drained of color.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliot's grin turned predatory as he warned, "I'm not interested in wasting time. Sign the damn paper. One phone call from me, and something bad will happen to Lily and Ashley."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava gritted her teeth and ground out each word like shards of broken glass. "Go ahead, keep pushing me. Threaten me all you want. But I won't sign. And if you so much as think about hurting Lily or Ashley, I swear, on everything I am, you'll rot in hell."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliot laughed triumphantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Since you're so tough, how about you listen to Ashley's voice?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His grin widened as he held up his phone and pressed a button.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sound of a little girl crying came through the speaker. Ava's face turned pale. It was unmistakably Ashley.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava shouted, "You scum! You kidnapped Ashley?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She glared at Elliot, a fierce blaze igniting in her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliot shrugged, feigning innocence. "Kidnap? Please. I'm just a concerned elder meeting with family. It's not like it's illegal, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He and his goons laughed, their arrogance suffocating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it! You're doomed. Alexander will never let you get away with this!" Ava retorted and gritted her teeth, her mind racing but coming up blank.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ava, if you don't sign, what happens if my guys accidentally slip up? Maybe they don't take such good care of Ashley, who could get burned or fall and, well, get disfigured. You understand what I'm saying, right?" Elliot said, each word a glaring threat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava remained silent, her gaze turning as frigid as ice. Not a single word escaped her lips, but she wished she could just put a bullet in this shameless bastard and end him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His smugness only grew as he declared, "If you don't sign, Ashley might just disappear. You know how common child trafficking is these days. If she gets lost, you'll never find her again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Actually, I wouldn't want anything to happen to Ashley. After all, she's family!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As long as you sign, Ashley and Lily will be safe and sound. Ashley is such a sweet, sensible girl. How could I stand by and let anyone harm her, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But listen, if you don't sign, it's not just Lily and Ashley who'll be in trouble. The people who got hurt at the scene won't let you off the hook, either.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Unless, of course, you find Julian. But let's be honest. Without signing, you'll never find him. And without him, you'll never clear your name."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He narrowed his eyes and stared at Ava with a smug expression. His confidence was suffocating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You bastard! You all deserve to die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava's hands shook with barely contained rage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ava, this is your last chance. If you don't sign, I'm making that call. Don't blame me if something happens to them."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliot lazily twirled his phone between his fingers, but the threat hung heavy in the air, sharp as a blade.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Buzz!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that precise moment, Ava's phone buzzed to life. She hesitated for just a second before pulling it out and glancing at the screen. As her eyes scanned the message, a wave of relief washed over her, and the deep frown that had been etched into her brow slowly softened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a message from Alexander, who had been blending in with the crowd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had heard every word Elliot said clearly.</span></p><div class="pagination">
