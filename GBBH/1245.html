  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This wasn't the time for pleasure, and Alexander already had enough women in his life. The last thing he needed was to attract more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The more women surrounded him, the stronger the dark power inside him grew.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sure, Alexander could keep it under control for now, but </span><span>he</span><span> knew if he ever let his guard down, he'd eventually transform into a Corrupted Warrior.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Logic kicked in, and Alexander knew he had to stop this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He quickly pushed Norah away, and the heat between their bodies began to cool.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I-I'm sorry," Norah stammered, her face flushed. "I didn't mean to..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander just gave her a gentle smile and patted her shoulder. "Look, Ms. Chapman, you're beautiful and charming, but this really isn't the right time."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Pfft!" Norah burst into giggles, her face still red but now with amusement rather than embarrassment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's so funny?" Alexander asked, confused.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You don't have much dating experience, do you?" she teased between laughs. "You're such a scaredy-cat."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She doubled over laughing, her curves shaking with each giggle, creating waves of alluring movement that only added to her natural charm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was at a loss for words. "Ms. Chapman, we've got a beast tide that could hit us any minute. We can't afford to lose our focus now, or else..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Alexander's dead serious expression and tone, Norah let out an awkward "Oh" and finally fell silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ahem..." Alexander cleared his throat, trying to shake off the uncomfortable moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From a guy's perspective, women like Norah&mdash;beautiful and with that special something&mdash;were totally his type.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Back before he'd made Advanced Warrior, Alexander would've been all over this opportunity to level up his Force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But these days, he knew his weakness all too well&mdash;that dark energy that kept building up inside him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This</span><span> meant he had to keep his distance from any unnecessary female attention.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne," Norah's voice dripped with sweetness, "how about we make a deal? Once this beast tide's over, let's go on a proper date? I'll do whatever you want. Isn't that what guys like? A girl who obeys him?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Norah's voice dripped with sweetness, clearly not ready to give up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If she'd only been acting on impulse before, Alexander's different reaction from other men had only made her more interested in him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander could only sigh deeply, feeling trapped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, Norah deliberately pressed closer, pushing her curves right against his chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander stepped back with a headache, feeling his carefully suppressed desires threatening to surface again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh come on." Norah giggled. "You guys always say one thing and mean another!" She couldn't stop laughing behind her hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander looked away, ignoring her completely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing his mood shift, Norah finally stopped laughing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you hungry?" she asked, switching tactics. "That fight must have worn you out. Let me get you something to eat."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Norah sashayed away, swinging her hips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander finally let out a breath. Sometimes being a guy was such a pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A few minutes later, Norah came back carrying a charcoal grill, loaded with skewers and BBQ seasonings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Nothing fancy. Just some grilled meat," Norah said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She set down the charcoal brazier, arranged the skewers on the rack, brushed them with seasoning, and fired up the grill.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grabbing a few bottles of beer, she cracked one open and handed it to Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hadn't realized how thirsty he was until that moment. The beer hit the spot as he took several long swigs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Norah rested her chin in her palm, her doe eyes sparkling as she stared at Alexander like he was the most precious thing she'd ever seen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander rubbed his temples, feeling a headache coming on with this situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry. I'll stop bugging you," Norah said quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing his expression start to darken, she immediately switched gears and got serious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She worked the grill like a pro, cooking the meat skewers over low heat and sprinkling on seasonings. The mouthwatering aroma filled the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander couldn't help but swallow hard as his throat bobbed. Those skewers smelled incredible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Norah's face lit up with a bright smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Here, take this one. I'll grill some more for you," she said. Nothing made her happier than passing a perfectly grilled skewer to Alexander. This moment was perfect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Out of nowhere, thunder cracked overhead as dark clouds came rolling in. A storm was definitely brewing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Norah's smile faded into a frown. Bad weather was the last thing they needed right now. It could seriously mess with their defenses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander wolfed down the rest of his skewer, his expression growing more serious by the second.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, the rain hit, starting as a light sprinkle before quickly turning into a full-on downpour, sheets of water hammering down around them.</span></p><div class="pagination">
