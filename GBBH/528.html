  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harry was very angry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You bastard, how dare you play tricks on me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander shrugged and said innocently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I didn't. Didn't you want me to leave? I did leave."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harry was trembling all over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You... You know that I want you to leave Brittany..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shut up!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brittany interrupted Harry harshly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Boy, do you know who my father is?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harry threatened Alexander angrily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander pretended to be surprised and asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, you've grown up so big, but you don't know who your father is? How pitiful. You don't even know who your father is."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brittany couldn't help laughing out loud.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even the people, watching the fun nearby, burst into laughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Someone shouted, "This question is stupid. If you want to know who your father is, go back and ask your mother."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harry was so angry that his face turned gloomy, and he waved his hand fiercely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Go ahead! Beat him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Several men immediately rushed towards Alexander like wolves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each of them was aggressive, ruthless and skilled. But unfortunately, they met Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How dare you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Alexander could make a move, Brittany got furious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She grabbed the motorcycle helmet and swung it hard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bang!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two men were hit hard on the head by the helmet and fell to the ground, screaming.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before the others could react, they were knocked down one by one by Alexander's punch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harry was so frightened that he stared at Brittany blankly. He didn't expect that Brittany was such a good fighter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brittany held Harry's chin with her helmet and said coldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If I see you again, I will destroy you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, she swung her helmet and smashed it hard on Harry's head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bang!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harry felt a buzzing and could not even stand steadily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get out!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brittany kicked Harry to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harry's face was filled with pain, and he couldn't get up. He could only watch Brittany and Alexander snuggle affectionately while they went to the private room on the second floor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this time, the onlookers looked at Harry and talked about him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What an idiot! Not only was he cheated out of money, but he was beaten up in public </span><span>by a beautiful woman."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Idiot! It's a disgrace!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harry's face turned red with shame. As a member of the Morris family, he was disgraced today.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The men finally got up and came forward to support Harry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Harry Morris, what should we do now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harry was filled with anger but had no place to vent it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Useless. What's the point of me spending money to support you?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What are you doing? Call someone right now. I'm going to kill that guy today!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, in the luxurious private room on the second floor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brittany and Alexander were feasting on a meal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Harry will not give up. He is one of the Morris family. We cannot take it lightly."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brittany reminded Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander chuckled. "I'm full. I can exercise and digest the food."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brittany's cell phone rang.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She saw the message, frowning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Grandpa sent me information that Felix went to the Morris house and reached a joint agreement with them. They want to target you together! What should we do?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was surprised.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We finally found him. Where is Felix exactly?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brittany said, "In Kaylon entertainment center! I think this is a trap. They are waiting for you to fall into their trap."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brittany saw through the trick.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smiled coldly, "Trap? Have they figured out who the hunter is?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a while, there was a loud noise coming from downstairs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That bastard is upstairs. Surround him. Don't let him get away!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Break his arms and legs. I want to see him lying on the ground begging me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harry was shouting wildly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were hurried footsteps downstairs. A large group of people were going up the stairs.</span></p><div class="pagination">
