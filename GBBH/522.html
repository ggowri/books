  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Please, Master, don't be angry. That's not what I meant."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diego shuddered and quickly bowed in apology.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Master, I am loyal to you. I hope you can forgive me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barry kept a cold, silent expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joyce flashed a smug smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought, "That old man always acts so superior, even trying to compete with me. Now he's getting what he deserves."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This old fool must be losing it. She was Barry's woman, and an old man like him could never compare.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diego couldn't resist reminding, "Master, Felix is extremely sly. He's only putting up with this humiliation to gain our support. He's hiding it well, but I can sense his killing intent."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barry frowned. He didn't take Felix seriously, but he knew Diego wouldn't speak without reason.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, I understand. Just keep an eye on Felix. I trust with your strength, you wouldn't lose to him, right?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I need to rest. You can go now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barry waved Diego off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As you wish, Master."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diego glanced at Joyce, nestled against Barry, and reluctantly left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as the door closed, a hungry desire lit up in Barry's eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Joyce, come here, relax a bit."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Master, let me run your bath first, then give you a nice massage to help you relax..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joyce's voice was sweet and playful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Forget the bath. We'll bathe after </span><span>we .</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barry pulled Joyce onto the bed, rolling with her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He leaned over her, firmly kneading her full, fair chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joyce responded eagerly, even pulling a pillow under her hips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barry grew even more excited, intensifying his actions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As a level-three metahuman, his strength was several times that of a normal person, quickly pushing Joyce to her limit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah! I'm </span><span>gonna</span><span> die..." Joyce felt herself going crazy, muttering things too wild to </span><span>hear...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By noon, Felix had truly taken on the role of a servant, arranging a lavish meal to please Barry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To make Barry happy, Felix had splurged on the finest seafood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The seafood had been freshly caught that day, offering a variety of options.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Mmm</span><span>, the seafood's great, really tasty!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barry kept praising the food between bites, never pausing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He focused solely on eating and drinking, showing no intention of conversing with Felix.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diego and Joyce also ate heartily, ignoring Felix entirely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix had prepared a few polite remarks, but being so blatantly dismissed made his anger boil over; he could barely restrain himself from slapping these arrogant fools.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, when they finished eating, Barry gave a sly smile and said, "Let's go out for a walk later. Bring your girl. Her name's Danielle, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix nodded with a forced grin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, Danielle. Let's take her out. It'll be fun."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barry looked pleased with Felix's response.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Make sure to bring enough money. I'm planning to hit the casino, too."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Barry wrapped an arm around Joyce's waist and, along with Diego, headed outside the hotel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix's expression twisted instantly, nearly grinding his teeth to dust.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You bastards, just wait. I'll make you pay for this!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After cursing, Felix turned to go find Danielle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a beautiful day as Barry and his group strolled along the beach near the casino.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Palm trees lined the path, and the place was bustling with people.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Many young women in revealing swimsuits drew attention like lights in the night.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Barry's group stood out the most, flanked by two stunning women: Joyce and Danielle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Danielle, with her blonde hair, was dressed especially provocatively.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At Barry's request, Danielle had put on a swimsuit that resembled lingerie, with only a few scanty straps covering her, even skimpier than a bikini.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Given that she was still in her nursing period, her already full chest looked even more ample; the few straps barely held it all in, with only a small patch of fabric just managing to cover her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her round, full hips were almost completely exposed, with a single thin strap disappearing into the curve.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each step Danielle took sent a mesmerizing ripple through her body, making her look unbelievably seductive.</span></p><div class="pagination">
