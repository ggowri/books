  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Frieza suddenly approached, and he swung his huge tail. With a bang, Erica was sent flying again, crashing through dozens of big trees.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Erica was still in the air when Frieza followed her closely. Scarlet air waves shot out, and Frieza suddenly appeared in front of her. With a strike of his thick and short right fist, he directly hit Erica's waist, sending her flying hundreds of feet away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Frieza's triangular eyes shot out fierce rays. He waved his two palms towards Erica, and countless scarlet light columns hit Erica with bangs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A huge, dome-shaped dazzling light explosion appeared and slowly expanded. With a rumble, a small mushroom cloud about 300 feet high rose up. A fierce wind blew, and the ground shook and cracked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's quite a fortune for you to see my full-power form!" Frieza crossed his arms in front of his chest, swung his huge tail, and cackled strangely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Huh!" Frieza looked surprised. He stared at the aftermath of the light explosion that hadn't dissipated yet, and a faint audible murmur sounded. "Burn, my life! Holiness comes from light. Burn, my life! Under the Lord's gaze, all the guilty will be purified!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As if in response to Erica's murmur, a sacred hymn suddenly resounded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A pure and dazzling radiance shot up into the sky. In this radiance, a magnificent and solemn arched gate, which was hundreds of feet high, suddenly emerged.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That giant gate emitted a holy and divine radiance, lighting up the entire sky.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blood oozed from the corner of Erica's mouth. Her light-golden long hair fluttered in the wind. Her tone became higher and more urgent. She bent slightly, clenched her fists, and held them high, shouting, "Under the throne of Lord, the embodier of the Lord's majesty, the great sovereign of the soul, Ramiel!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a deafening bang, like hundreds of thunderbolts exploding simultaneously, the gate in the air slowly opened. In the intense holy light, a huge figure appeared and stepped out of the gate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ramiel had silver hair and black pupils. Three pairs of huge white wings behind him were emitting golden holy light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ramiel held a silver holy bottle in his hand, exuding an imposing dignity. The holy bottle slowly tilted, and the holy flames rose. The pure and dazzling holy water poured into Erica's graceful body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Erica's fists were enveloped by the holy flames. The pure white and dazzling light ball grew larger and larger. The ground began to crack. The trees by the roadside bent down. Gravel and rubble slowly flew into the air and started to spin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Star Strike!" Erica spun around. She raised her fists and struck at Frieza. A sacred and huge dazzling light column, as if transcending time and space, instantly hit Frieza's chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a deafening bang, a huge light explosion appeared. A mushroom cloud over hundreds of feet high rose up. The ground shook and split. Deep and wide cracks were crisscrossed. Circular shock waves came one after another, reducing everything within a few miles around to powder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A streak of blood flashed through the air, and Alexander was sent flying far into the sky.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Erica glanced at the figure in the air, and a smug look flashed across her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the thick smoke dissipated, in the aftermath of the light explosion, Frieza knelt on one knee, his arms trembling constantly. Black blood splattered from his chest, and his whole body was bruised and swollen. His strange, narrow pupils looked fierce. He glared at Erica, wishing he could tear her into pieces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You dared to injure me, the heir of the Devil Cult! You forced me!" Frieza suddenly leaped up, took a horse-riding stance, and raised his arms. He clenched his ape-like palms. His slanting white eyes were bloodshot, and a murderous aura gushed out from his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Scarlet flames steamed and burst out over his body. The ground trembled. A deep pit suddenly appeared, and it was becoming larger and deeper.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The striped shell all over Frieza's body cracked, and pieces of it slowly fell off. His muscles suddenly bulged and grew stronger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah!" Frieza roared. His short figure expanded several sizes, becoming tall and burly, with big hands and feet. The slanting spikes on his head turned into a huge pair of ox horns.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Frieza swung his huge tail. With a dull thud, a huge rock turned into powder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the forest far away, Alexander finished his cultivation. He touched his chest, and the wound was gone as if it had never been there. He looked down at the place where there had been a bloody wound before, and the skin had become as smooth and tender as a baby's.</span></p><div class="pagination">
