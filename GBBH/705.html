  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cloe carried out his order without delay.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She immediately beckoned over several loyal subordinates and organized a team to clean out the vault.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She supervised the matter personally and left the rest to her subordinates.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander asked Shadow to arrange the guards and temporarily close all the docks in order to search the entire island carefully and capture the remaining enemies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosalia reminded him worriedly, "Mr. Hawthorne, Rock has escaped. He will definitely take revenge on us. Witchcraft is hard to guard against. We must be careful."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He patted her buttocks naturally.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You are right. Although Felix is dead, the City of Sorcery and the Mafia are still our enemies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Satan is a sinister and cunning old man. I offended him a long time ago. We are incompatible."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, Cloe ran over excitedly to report a piece of good news.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Good news! The underground vault does have over ten billion dollars in cash, as well as over 200 Level 2 power elixirs and a batch of combat exoskeletons."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander couldn't help but laugh with joy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Great! With the batch of Level 2 power elixirs and the combat exoskeletons, the Ultimate Alliance will be even stronger and have a bright future.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shadow, take half of the power elixirs and combat exoskeletons to enhance the strength of our subordinates, but they must be loyal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"By the way, ask the prisoners to find out which military leader Felix bought the combat exoskeletons from.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We can make long-term purchases. Don't be afraid to spend money. The Mafia and the City of Sorcery will not give up. After suffering such a big loss, they will definitely seek revenge."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The most urgent thing for Alexander now was to quickly improve the strength of his </span><span>subordinates and gain a firm hold on Treasure Island.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shadow was determined.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne, please rest assured. Leave these matters to me. I will definitely not let you down!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, that's good."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander nodded with satisfaction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Augusta came over and said, "Sir, these prisoners include people from the Red Umbrella Group and the City of Sorcery, as well as members of the Sakra Society in </span><span>Risun</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Sakra Society sent out Hana, its top assassin, and fifty elite men. Hana died, and twelve men were captured."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the mention of "</span><span>Risun</span><span>", Alexander's smile immediately disappeared, and his face darkened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He snorted, "I won't attack unless we're attacked. Since the Sakra Society is so ignorant, I will definitely destroy them."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sir, I will follow you till death, no matter what happens!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Augusta, Shadow, and the others all waved their fists excitedly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander returned to the headquarters building of the Brilliant Group only after making arrangements for everything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His face was slightly pale. He was injured in the battle with Felix.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What exactly was that evil entity?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Why could it transcend the limitations of time and space, transfer evil power to Felix, and then occupy his body?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After pondering silently for a while, Alexander heard subtle and familiar footsteps coming from outside. It was Cloe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He chuckled, knowing that she enjoyed that pleasure and would come to him on her own accord.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Alexander opened the door, Cloe was taken aback.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the sight of him, she blushed and threw herself into his arms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne, I really miss you..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cloe hugged Alexander and kissed him on the face eagerly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was stunned for a moment. She was really crazy. It seemed the orgasm he had given her the last time was so great that she could not help herself.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne, I miss you and want to make love to you every day..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cloe was panting. Her cheeks were flushed, and she was hot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She took off her clothes very actively, and soon only a set of sexy black lingerie was left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her huge, plump breasts, bound by a few small black laces, bulged out from the gaps. The stark contrast became an alluring sight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beneath her slender waist were her ample buttocks, and a black thong showed off her sex appeal.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander put his arms around Cloe and kneaded her plump buttocks hard, and it felt wonderful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, they embraced and kissed each other passionately.</span></p><div class="pagination">
