  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You little rascal, you're all smooth talk now, just trying to charm me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava gave him a playful scolding, hugging Alexander tightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander glanced down at his visible excitement and sighed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't know what's going on. I can last longer than ever now. No woman seems to be able to keep up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you don't believe me, we can try it out later. I never go all out."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava's face turned red; she knew what he said was true, but she didn't know how to respond.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Deep down, she had accepted that Alexander might have other women, but her possessiveness still made her jealous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava caressed Alexander, noting that he seemed more... substantial than before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She felt a warm, tingling sensation between her legs, a mix of excitement and discomfort.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was intense, and she wasn't sure she'd be able to handle it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're too good at this, and I don't want to hold you back. It wouldn't be fair to you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I swear, I only ever want to be with you. I'll never go looking for another man."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava promised with absolute conviction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Usually, it's men who swear loyalty to beautiful women, but with Alexander, it was the other way around.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There are two ways to win over a woman&mdash;money or satisfying her in bed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No matter how beautiful she is, even if she were a goddess, these two things always work.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava unzipped Alexander's pants.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Slap!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The intense sensation brushed across Ava's face, radiating a powerful, masculine energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava was both surprised and delighted. He really was bigger than before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you like it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander asked with a grin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I do... I'm just afraid I can't handle it..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava looked a little worried, wondering how intense this would feel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander didn't want to delay any longer; he moved in close.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmm, not only has your chest gotten bigger, but so has your bottom! How did that happen?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava panted softly, passively accepting his touch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I... I've been working out lately, so my </span><span>bottom's</span><span> bigger. Do you like it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's eyes sparkled with interest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In addition to working out, you should do yoga too. Then you'll have even more moves."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava shyly asked, "Doesn't a big bottom look ugly?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander quickly replied, "Ugly? Not at all. It's beautiful! They say a woman's bottom and a man's drive are key. It's the best."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stroked her full, round hips, enjoying the feel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava was already excited beyond her control.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You rascal, you already have a daughter. I want to give you a son. Come on!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Heat surged through Alexander as he couldn't resist squeezing her soft curves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava proudly pushed out her chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Our children will definitely be breastfed, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander took both in his hands, weighing them and giving a few squeezes, satisfied as he said, "Each one weighs a few pounds at least. There'll be milk. When my son's full, the rest will be for me. I want you to feed me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah! You're so bad! How did you get so good at flirting?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava trembled from his teasing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander grinned mischievously and commanded, "Turn over, so I can examine you properly."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without hesitation, Ava knelt and turned, raising her hips toward Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A scent with a hint of fresh ocean filled the air, making Alexander swallow hard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This has to be the best bottom in </span><span>Loscity</span><span>!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's heartfelt praise made Ava feel both proud and shy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Smack!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander gave her fair hips a firm slap, leaving faint handprints.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava collapsed on the floor, a tingling sensation overwhelming her, unable to lift her upper body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander couldn't wait any longer and hurriedly stripped off his clothes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava, breathless, turned her head to give Alexander a seductive look.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander moved over her, advancing with a powerful thrust.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava cried out in satisfaction, her body feeling completely overtaken by the intensity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There wasn't a single gap between them, and the tingling sensation was beyond words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For a long moment, her lips stayed open in an "O" shape, unable to close.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The fullness and intensity Alexander brought her were like nothing she'd ever experienced.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Time seemed to pass both quickly and slowly. Just as Alexander was hitting his stride, Ava was already lost in a dazed state.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her expression was a mix of pain, satisfaction, and joy, creating a strangely conflicted look.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava began to beg, but Alexander only quickened his pace, making her curvaceous body shake even more intensely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She muttered incoherently, rolling her eyes back, and finally passed out.</span></p><div class="pagination">
