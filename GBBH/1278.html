  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At first, she had wanted Alexander to keep his distance, but seeing the dozen zombie corpses scattered on the ground, she realized he had been protecting her all along.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The splashing of water was soon followed by more ominous sounds. Two zombies&mdash;one old, one young&mdash;came crashing out of another breeding pen, charging toward them like rabid dogs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without missing a beat, Alexander swung his blade, and their heads went flying into the darkness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The woman's eyes lit up at the sight. She gazed at Alexander with a mix of joy and admiration, looking at him as if he were some kind of savior.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander waited patiently for an hour while she cleaned herself up and changed into the black lace nightgown he had provided.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her curves were stunning in the revealing outfit. Without a bra, her breasts pressed against the delicate black lace in a way that left little to the imagination.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sheer fabric offered tantalizing glimpses of her smooth skin underneath, creating an alluring effect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander couldn't help but appreciate the view, a slight smile playing on his lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he was being honest with himself, having such an attractive companion made him feel a lot less lonely in this desolate world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My name is Sally Reyes," she said, her cheeks flushing pink. "What's yours?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She started to cover her chest with her hands but thought better of it, choosing instead to stand tall with confidence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Reyes, do you own this farm?" Alexander asked casually after introducing himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, I was just visiting with friends for a farm stay experience when this terrible disaster struck," Sally replied, her sad eyes drifting toward the dozen or so zombies lying there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She went on to explain her survival story. It had been pure luck that she'd stumbled into the livestock barn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was when she discovered the zombies had poor eyesight but a keen smell. The overwhelming stench of the barn had actually kept her hidden from them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sally explained how she'd started covering herself with animal waste to mask her scent, which allowed her to sneak to the grocery store for food and water.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was how she'd managed to survive all these days, though she knew she wouldn't have lasted much longer if Alexander hadn't shown up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you, Alexander!" Sally said gratefully, bowing deeply.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she bent forward, her generous curves were fully displayed before Alexander's eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander felt a stirring of desire. It had been nearly two weeks since he'd arrived in Kylaville, and he hadn't been with a woman since then.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, the absence of female company meant he hadn't been able to replenish the Force quickly, which was why it had taken so much effort to fight his way into Kylaville.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander took a deep breath, forcing himself to keep his emotions in check.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This woman was clever. Someone as stunning as Sally knew exactly what she was doing when she let Alexander get a glimpse of her body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The fact that she did it so deliberately, without any pretense of modesty, proved just how calculating she was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm leaving," Alexander announced flatly, turning toward his bike without bothering to say goodbye to Sally.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sally couldn't hide her shock. She'd made her advances pretty obvious, but Alexander hadn't shown the slightest interest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the top sales performer at her insurance company, she was smart enough to understand the usual give-and-take of these situations.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In this dangerous world, she believed women could only survive by attaching themselves to powerful men, and Alexander was clearly powerful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She'd thought she could use her looks to forge an emotional connection with him, maybe even gain some control over the situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Alexander's complete indifference had thrown her off balance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She took several deep breaths, trying to calm the rising panic in her chest. Being left alone here could be dangerous. Who knew what threats might be lurking?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, wait up!" Sally called out anxiously, hurrying after him. "Let me come with you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A knowing smile played across Alexander's lips. He had seen right through Sally's intentions from the start.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As a confident and capable man, Alexander refused to be tied down by anyone except Ava.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Still, if Sally played her cards right and stayed in line, he wouldn't mind offering her some protection while enjoying what she had to offer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander hung his backpack on the bicycle's handlebars and patted the back seat. "Hop on!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sally could barely contain her excitement as she clumsily climbed onto the back of the bike.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander mounted the bicycle and pushed off hard, sending them shooting forward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sally let out a startled shriek and nearly fell off, quickly wrapping her arms tightly around Alexander's waist to steady herself.</span></p><div class="pagination">
