  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As Alexander stared at the sensational headlines splashed across the news, a wry smile crept onto his face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was obvious that Orion had orchestrated this leak, and the comments section was a veritable cesspool of mockery.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">One particular comment had gone viral, racking up over a hundred thousand likes and replies.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I knew it! The poor guy was just a placeholder!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"That kind of top-tier socialite only plays with men like toys. Alexander? He's just trash."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Still, it's worth it. The president of the Saint Group is stunning and loaded. I hear she lives in Beverly Hills!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Word is, Alexander, riding high on the Saint Group's coattails, pissed off too many bigwigs in Loscity. Ava ditched him, and now he's toast."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The ridicule was relentless, and Alexander couldn't help but feel a sense of resignation wash over him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Human nature can be quite cruel. People just couldn't stand it when someone else was doing better than they were. They tended to puff up the success while looking down on those who were struggling.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Meanwhile, the Fairfax family was glued to the news.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even Andrew, still recovering in bed, felt a surge of excitement that seemed to dull his pain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With Ava no longer backing Alexander, they could finally get the upper hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jane was practically giddy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Alexander, you jerk! You turned me down, and now look at you&mdash;dumped by that skank! I'm loving this!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Belinda joined in the laughter, her voice dripping with disdain. "You can't polish a turd. Even Ava tossed Alexander aside. Jane, it's clear he's a total loser."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But Frank, sitting nearby, shook his head with a sigh.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You guys are underestimating Alexander. There's got to be more to this than meets the eye. After all the times he's schooled you, don't you think it's time to wake up?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Andrew scoffed, saying, "Dad, cut the gloom and doom. The news is out there&mdash;Ava dumped Alexander, and that's a fact. He's the laughingstock now!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Belinda nudged Frank.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Why don't you head to your room, old man? You're out of your depth here. Ava's rich and powerful; there's no way she'd stick around with someone like him. It was just a fling."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Once Frank was out of earshot, Andrew's confidence surged.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Now that Alexander is out of the picture, we can focus on the magic powder conference. If we can snag a piece of that pie, our family will rise to the top in Loscity!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Belinda frowned slightly. "But with our status, we don't even qualify to attend."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Andrew, however, was brimming with certainty.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Honey, Felicity just graduated!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"That Mr. Gellar, the one who developed the magic powder, is already in Loscity. He's a sucker for beautiful women.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If we can get Felicity to marry him, we'll definitely become one of the distributors&mdash;maybe even the main distributor!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Just imagine, the Fairfax family soaring to new heights! Who would dare cross us then?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Belinda paused, her brow furrowing. "Are you sure this magic powder is really from Mr. Gellar? What if it's a scam?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Andrew replied eagerly, "Trust me, it's the real deal. Mr. Gellar has been treated like royalty by Orion. I wouldn't know if it weren't for a good friend of mine who works for the Hansen family. He took a risk to tell me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Belinda's face lit up, and even Jane couldn't contain her excitement.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mom, Dad, if we can get Felicity to marry Mr. Gellar, our family will really hit the jackpot! We'll be the new elite in Loscity!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Belinda smiled approvingly. "If Mr. Gellar is indeed the magic powder's creator, he's bound to be wealthy. Sure, he might be a bit older, but your sister could do worse."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Andrew quickly pulled out his phone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'll reach out to Mr. Gellar and introduce him to Felicity as a potential fianc&eacute;e."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Belinda nodded enthusiastically.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes, hurry! We need to move fast before someone else beats us to it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jane's heart soared with hope.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If her sister could snag the so-called "Mr. Gellar", the Fairfax family would be unstoppable. Meanwhile, she imagined herself standing proudly over Alexander, who would be begging for her forgiveness.</p><div class="pagination">
