  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Four people, including the white-haired man, sat around the poker table playing a showdown game.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although the rules of showdown were simple, the stakes were high, making it a favorite among real experts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Zoom in on the screen and keep an eye on that old man!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Norma ordered sharply.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The image on the LCD screen zoomed in, showing even the pores on the old man's face with remarkable clarity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His subtle expressions couldn't escape the surveillance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne, the three beside him are our casino's top gambling experts. Each of them ranks in the top thirty worldwide."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although Norma's expression was serious, she wasn't too panicked. With three gambling masters at the table, they shouldn't lose too badly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, Alexander noticed that the three experts were in bad shape, with sweat covering their foreheads.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>One was fidgeting, and another's hand trembled as he held his cards.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander could tell immediately that they were nervous and bound to lose.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The white-haired old man facing the three experts looked relaxed and kept winning, with his stack of chips growing taller.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Just then, one of the gambling experts flipped over his hand and laughed triumphantly,</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ha! You old man, I don't believe you can beat me this time. Four tens&mdash;I win!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Showdown!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He pushed all his chips into the center of the table.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The other two teammates looked relieved and quickly folded, putting all their hopes on the four tens.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Fool!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The old man smirked and calmly flipped over his hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Four kings!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He laughed arrogantly as he pulled the massive stack of chips toward him, making his pile even larger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He won a few million dollars in that round, cleaning out the other side's chips worth tens of millions of dollars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The three gambling experts gritted their teeth, wanting nothing more than to snatch the chips back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Damn it, we can't win..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"It's over this time!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The three muttered to themselves and collapsed into their chairs like deflated balloons.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In just one hour, the three had lost over two hundred million dollars combined.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even though the casino was globally renowned and backed by the powerful Walsh family, losing over two hundred million dollars in an hour was unacceptable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If the losses continued, the very future of the casino would be at stake.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even though the Walsh family was worth billions, losing billions wouldn't be sustainable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Norma would likely lose control of the casino and even her position as head of the Dragon Gang, with Sean poised to take over completely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander saw through the entire situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"That old man wins every time; he's definitely cheating! Slow down the footage. I want proof to cut off those old hands of his!" Norma's voice dripped with menace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Norma commanded the staff to play the video in ultra-slow motion to spot any flaw in the old man's cheating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When the screen slowed down, everyone's eyes widened as they stared at it, searching for any sign of the old man cheating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander didn't even glance at the screen. His sharp eyes had already seen everything clearly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>How the old man swapped cards, his facial expressions, and every subtle move were all laid bare before Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander just chuckled and stayed silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The old man was incredibly fast!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So fast that even with the video slowed to its minimum speed, there was no trace of cheating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The conclusion was that the old man hadn't cheated and showed no suspicious behavior; he had won fair and square.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But everyone there was convinced he had to be cheating. There was no way luck alone could let him win every single time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Norma's three gambling experts seemed like children up against an adult, unable to put up any resistance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This guy is definitely up to something. If even the surveillance can't catch him cheating, he must be a world-class gambler!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"He must be one of the top five on the global gambling leaderboard..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Norma's expression turned grim, her mood sinking fast.</span></p><div class="pagination">
