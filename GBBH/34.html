  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The air thickened with tension as Ava and Oscar faced off. Their confrontation cast a palpable chill over the room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Sensing the brewing storm, Alexander attempted to diffuse the situation with a forced lightness in his voice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Ava, let's not dwell on unpleasantries. Let's sit over there," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With a dismissive glance at Oscar, Ava allowed Alexander to lead her away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Left standing, Oscar fell silent, but his aged eyes, now sharpened like flint, followed Alexander's retreating figure with a glint of unspoken challenge.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Let's go and see. Wait until my grandson arrives in Loscity; Ava must dump you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Amidst this, Alexander whispered to Ava, "Am I really your boyfriend? This feels like a dream."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With a playful snort, Ava replied, "You've just passed the initial test. How far we go depends entirely on you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander grinned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Well, you're my girlfriend for now. We'll figure out the rest as we go," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Hugging her waist, he leaned in for a kiss on her inviting, crimson lips.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just then, Billy clumsily timed his entrance with a glass of red wine.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Ms. Blackburn, Mr. Hawthorne, might I toast to you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava glared at him. "Why are you here?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Billy hastily offered an explanation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Ms. Blackburn, I was deceived by Ryan to challenge Mr. Hawthorne. I donated two million dollars to the Saint Charity Fund to be here tonight, barely securing an invite."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The mention of the sum made his heart wince visibly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander just smiled, harboring no despise toward Billy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Clearly, Billy admired the Saint Group, thereby spending the money to expand his network by mingling with the guests at the ball.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander raised his glass, clinking glasses with Billy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"The past is behind us. Let's look to the future," he proposed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Billy downed his wine in relief and joy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mr. Hawthorne, you're a man of honor. I'm at your service," Billy declared.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Gazing at Billy, Alexander teased, "So if I call on you in the future, you won't decline?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Billy was momentarily taken aback and nodded enthusiastically.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Billy thought, "The two million dollars was far from squandered. It helped me befriend Alexander, forging a connection with the Saint Group, a relationship cloaked in secrecy yet far more advantageous than depending on the Blood Gang."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He patted his chest and made a promise.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Absolutely, Mr. Hawthorne. For you, I'll brave any storm."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay. Go ahead. Leave me and Ms. Blackburn alone."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander waved Billy off.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After apologizing, Billy walked away joyfully.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava's gaze was quizzical.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You're considering him as an ally? Given that he establishes the Wolf Gang, he's capable. But he's also a ruthless snob. Be careful! "</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander chuckled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Thanks for the concern, honey. I'm not naive."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After a thoughtful pause, Ava turned serious and voiced her concerns.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Because of me, you're now in the spotlight and at the very center of the storm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It's dangerous, Alexander. One misstep could be disastrous.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"So, if you want to ally with Billy, I have no objections. Still, there is cause for caution."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander was silent for a while.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Don't worry. Give me a year, and I'll give you the grandest wedding."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Who said anything about marrying you? You're presumptuous!" Ava retorted, though her flushed cheeks betrayed her true feelings.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After a while, others began to drift over to greet Ava respectfully, but they only nodded at Alexander politely.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Those who approached Ava were influential figures from every corner of society. In fact, they regarded Alexander with barely veiled disdain, dismissing him as nothing more than a gigolo unworthy of their attention.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander observed the dance floor, taking in the vibrant scene around him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Hundreds of guests mingled. They were clustered into more than a dozen small groups, each defined by the weight of their family names and corporate empires.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It struck Alexander as enlightening; he hadn't anticipated that even the wealthy elite would be stratified in such a way.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just as the atmosphere reached a fever pitch, a sudden crash shattered the revelry. The door swung open with a violent force.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Several security guards from the Saint Group were thrown in.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The room fell into an eerie silence. The laughter and chatter were extinguished in an instant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Faces turned pale. Who would dare to stir trouble at the very heart of the Saint Group?</p><div class="pagination">
