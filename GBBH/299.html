  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melin was furious and cursed, "Bastards! These beasts deserve to die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Officer, we really can't wait any longer," Alexander said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He picked Melin up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't touch me. What are you doing?" Melin panicked, stuttering and lightly hitting him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm trying to save you," Alexander explained.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't need your help. I want to wait for the doctor," Melin said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She grabbed Alexander's hand, not letting him touch her right chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You really want to wait for the doctor?" Alexander asked, frowning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes. Don't worry about me, I can hold on," Melin muttered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her mind was already confused. She looked at Alexander with hunger and greed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay, I'll respect your decision," Alexander said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He placed Melin back in the driver's seat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melin moaned softly, writhing. Her hands uncontrollably rubbed her body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander tried to help her with the Force, hoping to stop the reaction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But after a while, Melin became even more confused.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get over here!" she muttered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She grabbed Alexander and pulled him towards her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tell me, do you like me?" Melin asked, her body flushed and hot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's so itchy. Aren't you going to help me remove the poison? Quick, suck the poison out," she said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She pressed Alexander's head to her right chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was speechless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just a moment ago, Melin said she could hold on, but now she was completely confused.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the poison needle in Melin's right chest needed to be removed. Then he could suck out the poison with his mouth and use the Force to heal her. It might work.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He unhooked her braes, revealing her large breasts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander swallowed, feeling a surge of desire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He controlled his urge and focused on the swollen wound on Melin's right chest, where a tiny needle mark was visible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melin's mind was hazy, but she knew what Alexander was doing. She felt weak all over and panted softly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander didn't hesitate anymore. He channeled the Force into his hands and covered her chest, gently massaging it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the Force's pull, the tiny poison needle came out of the wound like it was attracted by a strong magnet. Alexander caught it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He examined the needle in the light and sniffed it, frowning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He muttered, "I don't know what poison is on this, but as I thought, if you're poisoned like this, you must find a way to relieve it within an hour.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Otherwise, the poisoned person will fall into hallucinations, and their brain nerves will be damaged. Officer, do you really want me to help you remove the poison?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melin couldn't control herself. She felt like countless ants were crawling under her skin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She gazed at Alexander, wanting to hug him tightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bad guy, I knew you wanted to take advantage of me. Quick, aren't you going to help me suck out the poison?" she said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander looked at Melin's tempting eyes and her full chest. He couldn't resist anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He placed his hand on the wound and leaned in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feeling Alexander's sucking, Melin closed her eyes, murmuring.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander pulled Melin onto his lap.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then I'll start now, fulfilling your wish," he said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melin cried out, briefly regaining consciousness before being overwhelmed by the wonderful sensation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She hugged Alexander tightly, seeking his comfort.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's heart raced as he kissed her smooth skin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the help of the Force, drops of poisoned blood flowed out of the wound.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Alexander finished helping Melin remove the poison, an hour had passed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melin's face was flushed, and although she could move again, she felt weak all over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's all your fault, taking so long! Good thing Sir Fairfax didn't wake up, or I wouldn't be able to face him," she said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She pinched Alexander's leg and looked at the unconscious Frank.</span></p><div class="pagination">
