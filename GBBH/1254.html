  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Oswald thumped his chest confidently. "Fiona, I'm all in for you. If those monsters come crashing in, you just stay behind me. I swear, I'd rather die defending you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shut it! Don't talk like that!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fiona's anger flared, her </span><span>machete</span><span> </span><span>once again pressed against Oswald's neck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her voice quivered. "You can't die. If anyone's going, it's </span><span>gotta</span><span> be me first. You need to keep living..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, Oswald showed no sign of fear. He snatched the </span><span>machete</span><span> </span><span>from her hand and tossed it to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The orange glow of the fire illuminated his face, revealing an unprecedented determination.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fiona, I'm a man. Hiding behind a woman? That's not how it works!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fiona fell silent as tears welled up in her eyes and slipped down her cheeks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Oswald instinctively pulled her into an embrace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The commotion caught the attention of those nearby.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Look at that! Fiona and Oswald are getting cozy!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course they are; they grew up together. What's so surprising about that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"When did you two get together? We had no idea!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A crowd quickly gathered, laughter and chatter filling the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fiona felt a flutter of shyness, snuggling into Oswald's embrace, resting her head against his chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Oswald chuckled, "Well, now the whole world knows, huh? We agreed that nobody gets to die. And after this, we're getting married! You'll give me two&mdash;no, three sons!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ugh, who said I'd bear your kids?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fiona playfully swatted Oswald's cheek, but her heart melted at his words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ha! You totally will!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laughter erupted around them, but suddenly, someone atop the wall shouted, "The beast horde is stirring!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Panic broke the jovial moment; everyone rushed to the walls, leaving only Fiona and Oswald behind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They're coming back!" Fiona clung tightly to Oswald.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Whispering in her ear, he urged, "You can't die! You have to remember our promise&mdash;to get married and have kids together!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fiona's eyes sparkled with a fierce light as she shyly nodded. "Okay, but you can't die either. We're in this together!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's go!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hand in hand, they marched toward the makeshift wall, weapons ready, both wearing expressions of happiness, their movements steady and calm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A low growl echoed from the darkness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, a series of terrifying roars erupted, followed by a cacophony of rustling </span><span>noises.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under the heavy cloak of night, the sound of chaos drew near, even if the beast horde remained hidden.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gradually, the noises grew louder and more pronounced.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The rest of the group, aside from Alexander and a few others, felt the tension rising; they could sense the approaching beasts but not see them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The monsters were drawing closer through the shadows, like an unstoppable tide of terror.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a quick flick of his wrist, Alexander ordered his men to fire off some flares into the night sky.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bright trails of light burst into existence, illuminating the darkness for a fleeting moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The workers at </span><span>Louvian</span><span> Port stood frozen in shock, trembling as the beast horde became apparent&mdash;much more terrifying than during the day.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While the previous beast wave consisted mostly of small feral mutations, now they faced an army of established predators.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tigers, lions, and bears had transformed, their imposing forms swelling to two or three times their original size, as if ancient giants had returned to wreak havoc upon the world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The chorus of roars from these mutated beasts surged violently, a wave of sound crashing toward the port like a roaring ocean.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Except for Alexander, everyone else, including Norah and Augusta, turned ashen, terror written across their faces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Some were visibly shaking, unable to control their fear, and a few even found themselves too frightened to hold it together.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Open fire!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At Alexander's command, the most dangerous moment had arrived. It was no longer the time to conserve ammunition.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instantly, everyone began to fire wildly, a barrage of bullets and shells tearing through the air, unleashing a torrent of metal into the horde of beasts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Phosphorus and incendiary rounds rained down, creating a wall of fire several hundred yards from the city walls.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mutated beasts were engulfed in flames, burning fiercely. The intense heat illuminated the battlefield, revealing a scene of relentless chaos.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The wave of beasts was far more ferocious than during the day, with countless mutated creatures charging toward the inferno.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even as their bodies burned, they continued to surge forward, driven by some unseen terror behind them, madly rushing toward </span><span>Louvian</span><span> Port.</span></p><div class="pagination">
