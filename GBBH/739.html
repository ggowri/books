  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>An expert shouted with disdain, "Who are you? Do you have the right to speak here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elaine looked at Alexander indifferently, with a contemptuous expression like a master looking at her slave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Humph! Who do you think you are? How dare you act so presumptuously in front of me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He glanced at her wryly, with a fierce light on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah! It's you, Alexander. I've been waiting for you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Gideon saw Alexander, he was overjoyed and immediately took the initiative to go up to him and shake hands with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smiled and said, "Mr. Patterson, I am ready and I am sure I can eliminate the plague. Since they have no solution, let's not waste time. Let me try, so that they won't look down on us."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was an uproar at the scene.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Can you eliminate the plague? Liar!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Impossible. You are so young, and how can you be able to eliminate the plague? We are experts, but who are you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Humph! Anyway, I don't believe him. Mr. Patterson, don't be fooled."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These people were all medical experts, and they were very arrogant. It would be strange if they were not angry when Alexander told them in public that they were wasting time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Eddy and others did not despise Alexander together, they were still full of doubts and distrust.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander shook his head and sneered disdainfully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elaine glared at him. "What are you laughing at? You said you were ready to </span><span>eliminate the plague, so tell us what you have planned."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She walked up to Alexander, and they looked at each other.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because of her high heels, Elaine and Alexander were the same height, and they stared at each other with their eyes, neither giving in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He did not answer but instead glanced at her plump and towering breasts, which made her even angrier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why aren't you talking? I know you're a liar. All the people in Loscity are liars. Catch him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At Elaine's command, several of her personal bodyguards immediately surrounded Alexander and were ready to attack him aggressively.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get lost!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He waved his hand casually.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Several burly bodyguards fell out with screams as if they were hit by a truck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone around was startled and quickly moved away from Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elaine's face changed drastically, and she was obviously scared, but she still stared at Alexander arrogantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gideon was furious and shouted, "Stop it! Whoever dares to touch Alexander will have trouble with me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone frowned. They didn't expect Gideon to do this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, the atmosphere at the scene became more solemn and tense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anderson asked seriously, "Mr. Patterson, do you know this gentleman?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gideon said with certainty, "Mr. Blunt, I believe in Alexander. I was infected with the plague before, and he cured me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What? Can he cure plague patients? Alexander... Could it be the man who developed the magic powder?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anderson was surprised and delighted at once.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smiled slightly, "Mr. Blunt, I developed the magic powder. Please believe me, and I am sure I can eliminate the plague."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His sharp eyes swept across and immediately made everyone nervous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, he is Alexander. The magic powders and beauty ointments he developed are very popular!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Did he cure Mr. Patterson from the plague? Maybe he can really do it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone was talking about it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eddy was even more excited. "Mr. Hawthorne, if you can really eliminate the plague, then you will be the savior of all of us in Loscity!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander glanced at her, then smiled at Melin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He ignored everyone else and walked toward a bed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In this temporary intensive care center, dozens of beds were filled with patients.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Various medical instruments were connected to the patients, but the patients had already become emaciated, dying, and in great torture.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though they were all well-known figures in Loscity, even though they had wealth and status, at this moment, they could only lie in bed and wait to die.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander walked past each bed, looking for the patient in the most critical condition.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, he determined the target.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Archer Crawford, the president of Loscity Pharmaceutical Group, was the most seriously ill, and his life had begun to count down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If no miracle happened, Archer would die within a few hours. His life could already be measured in seconds.</span></p><div class="pagination">
