  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ouch!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ashley cried as she ran. Her foot suddenly tripped, and she fell hard to the ground, wincing in pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Little jerk, are you still escaping?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You run fast. Even though you're so young, you're as cunning as a fox."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hurry up and grab her back before Daniel gets mad."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A few men complained, and one of them, a fat man, reached for Ashley's neck like a hawk with a chicken.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was a roar of anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander appeared as quickly as lightning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The fat man screamed miserably and flew out like a cannonball, smashing hard into the wall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before the other guys could respond, they felt a sharp pain in their chests, fainted, and fell to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dad! Hurry up and save Ava. Someone is trying to bully us."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ashley immediately hugged Alexander's thigh when she saw him and cried tears of joy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander wrapped his arms tightly around Ashley, who was truly frightened, her eyes filled with tears and looking very aggrieved. Her knees were covered in blood, which was obviously caused by her fall when she was running away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dad, they're bad people. Beat them up."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ashley's large eyes as lovely as jewels were filled with anticipation and eagerness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay, I'll go beat the bad guys!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's eyes were filled with anger and murderous intent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked around with stern eyes, making people feel like he was the death who descended from hell to earth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They're on the third floor!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ashley pointed at a certain room in the building.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander hugged Ashley and rushed in as fast as he was flying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, Ava had been trapped in the office. She was slowly cornered by Daniel, shaking uncontrollably.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get out of here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava grabbed a mug and aimed it at Daniel, her hands constantly shaking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Haha, I just like hot women like you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daniel </span><span>laughed,</span><span> his eyes filled with desire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The women I love can never escape, so I think you'd better be good so you can suffer less. Otherwise, if I do something, you'll get a hard time, and so will that little jerk.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That little jerk is going to be brought back soon, so I hope you won't force me to do anything. Even if you don't think about yourself, you have to consider her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daniel smugly threatened her as he slowly approached.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you dare to touch us, you'll be dead!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava glared at him, ready to throw the mug at him at any time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come on, pretty girl, why don't you throw it over here? I'll see if you can kill me later when we get to the bed. Ha-ha-ha..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daniel grinned wickedly, and he couldn't wait.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had never been with such a sexy woman before, and he simply couldn't control his desire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you believe I will kill you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava's face was full of indifference with anger in her tone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daniel mocked disdainfully, "Sure. You can kill me in bed, and I'll be glad. Ha-ha!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He found the cat and mouse game interesting now. The more Ava was scared, the more he felt a sick sense of conquest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As long as you behave yourself, I won't touch the little jerk later. Otherwise, I'll cut off that little jerk's hands and feet first.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm the supervisor here, so I'm surrounded by my people. Your asshole boyfriend won't come. If he dares to come, I'll kill him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daniel threatened Ava as he pressed on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought that he had all the experience and means to deal with women and that women would just be shy. After he slept with her, he would teach her a lesson, and she would naturally surrender.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daniel did a lot of such bad things, and some of those women he bullied wanted to commit suicide, some wanted to call the police, but they were eventually threatened and seduced by him in various ways. In the end, they were all so submissive that they didn't dare to resist at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava regretted it and thought she shouldn't have been tricked into coming to this damn place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luckily, Ashley was so smart that she just ran out immediately when they weren't paying attention.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava hoped that Ashley could find Alexander to save her. She kept thinking of Alexander in her mind, expecting him to rescue her again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmph!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daniel sneered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Did you truly think that little jerk could get away? My men must have grabbed her already, so you should behave yourself, and I won't let the little jerk suffer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now that you're in my room, no one can save you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was grinning hideously and lunged at Ava with open arms.</span></p><div class="pagination">
