  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hazel's face was pale, her eyes full of terror.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They've got people </span><span>spying on me </span><span>outside. As soon as I step out, they'll catch me. They must have seen you when you arrived. We</span><span>'re not able to </span><span>escape!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander</span><span> was cool</span><span> as he spoke.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry. None of them will get away. I will kill </span><span>all of</span><span> them, </span><span>for justice</span><span>!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing the confident look on Alexander's face, Hazel still didn't believe him. She </span><span>thought</span><span> he was too young, and he didn't look particularly capable. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hazel</span><span> felt he was just a </span><span>handsome young man. That was all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She hesitated, then asked with a touch of hope, "Can we really leave safely?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get out of the way! Or I'll shoot</span><span> you</span><span>!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, Malcom's angry roar came from downstairs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, there was a loud bang, clearly the sound of Malcom firing his shotgun.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Fuck</span><span>, old </span><span>geezer</span><span>! You actually dared to shoot? Do you want to die?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Someone downstairs was shouting arrogantly, and their voice was full of menace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You old fool, do you think we're scared of you? I'll burn your house down tonight if you don't hand that woman over!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you don't hand her over, we'll kill your entire family tonight!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hazel was shaking in fear, quickly pulling Riley into her arms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They're here! It must be Cyclops! What should we do?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A murderous glint flashed in Alexander's eyes, but his expression remained unchanged. With Rosalia downstairs, he wasn't worried at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, Hazel grabbed Alexander's arm in desperation, her voice trembling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shouldn't we contact Norma and have her send </span><span>some guys</span><span> to take us away? Cyclops has too many men, and we're too few to fight back..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander gave a slight smile, brushing her hand away. "Don't worry. Come with me, and it</span><span> will</span><span> be fine."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He grabbed Hazel and dragged her downstairs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He cursed in his mind, "A group of scum</span><span>bags</span><span>." He didn't expect that these men didn't just kill</span><span> people</span><span>. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They </span><span>ate</span><span> people like demons</span><span> or animals</span><span>. Alexander had never been this angry before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had determined that he wouldn't let a single one of them live. They all </span><span>must</span><span> die.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Malcom, holding his gun</span><span> with</span><span> pale</span><span> face</span><span>, trembling uncontrollably, </span><span>was </span><span>clearly terrified.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Call the police, let them deal with these guys..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His wife clung to him, afraid he would get hurt. The two pitiful old people were shaking like leaves in the cold wind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Outside, more than a dozen men stood around, all dressed in black trench coats. Some were covered in tattoos, and some had dyed red hair. They all had lewd grins. They carried various weapons, clearly no good people.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were talking about Rosalia, laughing with sinister, greedy smiles, showing no fear of Malcom's shotgun.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A tattooed man whistled at Rosalia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey, little beauty, why don't you come over and have some fun with us? </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>We'll make sure you're well taken care of. You can't rely on this old guy to protect you. He can't even protect himself!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nearby, a bald man laughed and added, "Hand over Hazel, and this </span><span>hot chick</span><span> </span><span>should</span><span> come with us. If you do that, we'll let the two old fools go and pretend like nothing happened. How about it?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, I'll give you five minutes to decide."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosalia didn't say a word. Her eyes were cold with disdain. If it weren't for Alexander's orders, she would have already struck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Given her ability, none of that trash would survive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Malcom pulled Rosalia inside, whispering urgently, "Rosalia, don't do anything rash! Let's call the police. If they break in, I have the right to </span><span>shoot them!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But there are too many of them. If things turn violent, you and your boyfriend need to </span><span>leave </span><span>here. Don't worry about us ."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Malcom was clearly desperate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The neighbors, scared of trouble, had all locked themselves inside, pretending like they didn't see anything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosalia </span><span>smiled</span><span> softly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry, Uncle Malcom.</span><span> Dealing with these assholes is a piece of cake for </span><span>me. If they dare to come inside, I'll kill them all!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing he couldn't stop Rosalia, Malcom was so anxious he was about to cry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, the bald man glanced at his watch and sneered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Two minutes left</span><span>! </span><span>This is your last chance to think it over!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosalia smiled sweetly, walking toward him and saying in a </span><span>sweet</span><span> voice, "Hey, we've already made up our minds!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
