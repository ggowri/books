  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Logan lay there, his arm soaked in blood, bandages wrapped around his shoulder, with crimson still oozing through.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A nasty, swollen bruise marred the back of his head, festering a dark hue, the contusion pushing alarmingly against his scalp&mdash;it was a</span><span> </span><span>horrified</span><span> sight</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was completely unconscious, eyes tightly shut, unaware of the chaos around him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Augusta, Marvin, and Betty, alongside a handful of other subordinates, </span><span>surrounded</span><span> anxiously at his bedside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What happened? Why did the Fraternity attack us?" Alexander questioned, his tone serious, scanning their faces for answers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Betty and the others exchanged uneasy glances, their expressions turning awkward as they hesitated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Spit it out! What's going on?" Alexander pressed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Betty leaned closer, whispering urgently into Alexander's ear, "It's like this... the guy who tried to kidnap Mary, Mark, is tied to the Fraternity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"David was pulling the strings behind him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now that David's dead, the Fraternity couldn't get paid, so they're out for revenge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They </span><span>attacked</span><span> our headquarters with over a hundred guys, trying to snatch our magic powder."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander felt a pang of guilt&mdash;this mess was partly his fault. Thankfully, Marvin and Logan had two teams with them, totaling just over twenty men.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They managed to push back the Fraternity's assault, but at a cost: dozens of their enemies were either dead or injured, and half of his crew had been hurt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Logan had bravely defended the warehouse storing the magic powder, taking down several of the attackers but </span><span>taking</span><span> a gunshot wound to his arm and a blow to the back of his head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Boss, the doctor said Logan's in critical condition. He might not make it, so you really need to do something!" Augusta seized Alexander's arm with desperation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Betty frowned, adding solemnly, "The main issue was that blow to his head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The doctor mentioned he's suffering from a severe </span><span>brain</span><span> hemorrhage. Even if we manage to save him, he might end up a vegetable."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander waved them off, his face impassive. "I get it. Just give me a moment."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stepped closer to the bed, channeling the Force Sense to probe Logan's body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The air was thick with tension as everyone watched him intently</span><span> in</span><span> silence</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moments later, a smile broke through Alexander's steely expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No need to panic, I can heal him. It's serious, sure, but he's not going to die</span><span> or </span><span>end up a vegetable."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A sigh of relief spread through the group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Everyone except Augusta, Marvin, and Betty&mdash;get out. I need privacy to work. No interruptions," Alexander commanded, and his subordinates quickly exited the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's eyes sharpened with determination. He placed his hands on either side of Logan's head, summoning the Force deep within.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A stream of Force flowed into Logan's skull, dissolving the mass of bruised blood slowly but surely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, beads of sweat began to dot Alexander's forehead. The severity of Logan's injuries had drained the Force rapidly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Twenty long minutes ticked by, and finally, Alexander withdrew his hands with a sense of relief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Logan's suffering expression had vanished; he lay relaxed, drifting deep into slumber.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Fraternity is asking for death," Alexander muttered coldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His anger simmered just beneath the surface. Initially, he thought the magic powder would earn him respect from the power players in </span><span>Loscity</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead, it seemed they viewed him as prey, first the Cripples and now the Fraternity. Alexander realized it was time to </span><span>give</span><span> a proper warning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Boss, the Fraternity is one of the four major gangs in </span><span>Loscity</span><span>, right behind the Cripples and the Blood Gang, and directly under the Kaylon. If we're going to hit back, we need a solid plan," Betty cautioned, clearly concerned about Alexander's impulsive actions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a cold chuckle, Alexander's once fiery gaze had now returned to its usual steely calm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just a minor gang, the Fraternity, you can trust me&mdash;I don't take risks."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This mess is my fault, and I've dragged you all into it. I'll be settling the score with the Fraternity and avenge Logan, </span><span>don</span><span>&rsquo;</span><span>t worry</span><span> about it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He scoffed at the notion of the so-called fourth largest gang in </span><span>Loscity</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Guzman himself didn't intimidate Alexander, let alone these nobodies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Augusta quickly stepped in, trying to </span><span>stop him</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Boss, I know you're tough, but you can't go after them alone. We're coming with you!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
