  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The protective shield was shaking more and more. It made cracking sounds like breaking glass.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Cracks appeared all over the shield.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>These cracks spread quickly, covering the entire shield.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was clear that the amulet's protection was about to reach its limit. The energy in the gemstone was almost gone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If Alexander hadn't become stronger and better at making amulets, this one would have been destroyed by Rock and Monica already.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Yvonne, you deserve to die. Hand over the amulet," Monica shouted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Hand it over to me. It's not too late now," Rock said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They didn't want the amulet to be destroyed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The black snake squeezed tighter, and more cracks appeared on the shield. But Yvonne wasn't scared at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone thought Yvonne was ready to die, but they didn't know she had someone powerful backing her up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I dare you!" a cold voice said from outside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The voice wasn't loud, but it echoed like thunder. Everyone covered their ears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Who is it?" everyone wondered, turning to look at the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Who dares to touch my people?" the cold voice said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was like needles in their ears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Monica and Rock were both shocked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The sound hit Rock, who was attacking Yvonne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was as if thunder was exploding in his ears, accompanied by a sharp, stabbing pain. Rock instantly turned pale and stumbled backward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The black snake around Yvonne disappeared into black smoke.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Monica and Rock were stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They wondered what kind of witchcraft it was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They didn't realize it was Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Master!" Yvonne shouted happily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She wasn't affected by the sound.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Is it really Alexander?" Everyone stared at the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They wanted to see what Alexander looked like and if he was as powerful as the stories said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A tall, handsome figure appeared at the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He stood with the sun behind him, making it hard to see his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When Alexander stepped into the hall, everyone could see his handsome face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"It's indeed him." Rock gritted his teeth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He remembered the battle on Treasure Island.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander's followers had almost defeated him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Rock put his hand on the Ancient Grimoire, ready to defend himself. He stopped attacking Yvonne and stared at Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone looked behind Alexander, but there was no one else.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He was there alone, which was kind of an insult to the City of Sorcery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander remained composed despite facing such a large crowd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He pranced to Yvonne, as if he were just taking a walk after dinner instead of causing trouble there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Alexander, what do you want?" Rock asked, trying to hide his fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He didn't know why, but Alexander's presence brought him an uneasy feeling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Monica coldly stared at Alexander, the biggest enemy of the City of Sorcery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Sorry, I'm a bit late," Alexander said casually.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yvonne was so happy she had tears in her eyes. "Master, I didn't complete my task."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander smiled, "No, you did well. You showed everyone that Rock and Monica are not united.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"They will fight each other eventually even if you don't appear. The City of Sorcery has no future."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His words were provocative, but no one could retort. He was telling the truth.</span></p><div class="pagination">
