Attend the reception like this and take it home later. That way, you'll think of me all night."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You are so bad!" Madelyn blushed and couldn't look up, but ultimately followed Alexander's advice, put on her skirt, and got out of the car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander led her through the manor gates again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A waitress who had discovered their secret looked at Alexander in shock, clearly surprised by his endurance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander felt a swell of pride.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Meanwhile, Grace was arguing with her mother, Ave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ave held her hand and tried to persuade her earnestly, "Are you stupid? Asher is from a powerful family, a genius with both lineage and ability.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Where else can you find a better man? I worry about your future. Why are you being so disobedient?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Grace replied firmly, "Mom, I don't like him, and I don't want to see him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ave frowned. "But Asher can cure your grandfather's injury. You love him dearly. Do you want to see him suffer?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Calmly, Grace responded, "I won't sacrifice my happiness for anyone. I don't care about status or wealth. Grandpa doesn't need Asher. Alexander can help him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Are you stupid? Alexander is a gangster who relies on women to get ahead. Do you really see a future with him?" Ave was exasperated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Grace blushed but said nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ave was furious. "Do you really like Alexander? He has many women around him. If you don't believe me, you can find out. He is a philandering man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If you get involved with him, you'll have to compete with other women for his favor, and sooner or later you will be disliked by him. Are you sure that is the life you want?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ave trembled with anxiety, hating Alexander even more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Grace continued, "Mom, love is unpredictable. Besides, Alexander is single and a good person. It's not surprising he has admirers."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Grace was nearly enraged.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She thought, "If the granddaughter of the No. 2 person in the Avalora couldn't marry well, it would bring shame to the Lawson family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>I'm afraid that by then, not only will she have nothing, but she will also become a laughing stock."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Despite Ave's persuasion, Grace remained silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing Grace's uncooperativeness, Ave sighed deeply. "It's your grandfather's fault for spoiling you. How about meeting Asher first, and we can discuss the future later?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"No, I don't want to see him." Grace shook her head firmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You! Are you trying to drive me crazy?" Ave's face turned pale with frustration. If Grace weren't her daughter, she would have slapped her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She secretly cursed Alexander, believing he had seduced her daughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At that moment, Asher was getting impatient waiting in the small hall and walked quickly into the hall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He was tall, wearing a well-ironed brand-name suit, and had a stylish hairstyle and very handsome facial features, exuding an aristocratic air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His appearance sparked murmurs among the guests.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Wow, who is that? So handsome!" A woman gasped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"That's Asher, the heir of the Vance family in Kingsdon. He was called the first genius while studying abroad in the Avalora."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"He's declared Grace as his fianc&eacute;e, with her grandfather being the No. 2 person in the Avalora. This is a powerful alliance. Even the top leaders of Eagle Empire are in favor of this marriage. It will help maintain peace between our empires."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I heard Asher is skilled in martial arts and medicine. Isn't that impressive?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Absolutely!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The crowd marveled, their envious gazes fixed on Asher.</span></p><div class="pagination">
