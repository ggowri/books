  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cloe shook her head. "He doesn't know. Earlier, he even asked me why Edison was </span><span>missing. I told him you'd assigned him a special task, and he wouldn't return to the island for a while."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smiled slightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Later, when you inspect the trading center, I'll follow in the shadows. Maybe we can expose his true face."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cloe suddenly blushed and stammered, "Boss, you've been working hard... You should get some rest. I'll make up the bed for you..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, she turned and hurried into the bedroom, her hips swaying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was taken aback. It seemed Cloe had made up her mind to take things further with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After waiting a while and not seeing Cloe come back out, Alexander couldn't resist knocking on the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Knock, knock, knock!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was no response from inside. Could something </span><span>have</span><span> happened to Cloe?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander felt a bit concerned and pushed the door slightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The door creaked open to reveal a room decorated in soft pinks. It's a woman's private space. Fluffy, cute stuffed animals were scattered everywhere, with a few pieces of lingerie on the floor, faintly emitting a delicate fragrance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He froze, gazing at Cloe as she reclined on the large pink round bed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cloe had changed into a set of white lingerie; a demi-cup bra held her ample curves, with a hint of pink blush visible around the peaks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her delicate navel, slender waist, and lace thong nestled between her soft curves completed the alluring image, her long, toned legs crossed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cloe, looking utterly enticing, waited until Alexander entered before giving a sultry smile, flicking her tongue across her lips, and beckoning him with a finger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Boss, you saved my life. Without you, I wouldn't be here... Come over. I want to give everything to you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander couldn't help but swallow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Cloe, are you sure you won't regret this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He walked up to the bed, admiring the vision of this "Sleeping Beauty" before him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hehe, I like strong men!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cloe reached out, lightly resting her hand over his excitement, her eyes full of longing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>So</span><span> firm... that proves you like me too, Boss..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cloe was thrilled and excited by Alexander's response.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Alexander had been with many beautiful women, Ava was still his favorite, yet he was becoming more open-minded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As long as both were willing and it sped up his absorption of James' Force, Alexander saw no reason to resist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Alexander reminded himself to stay vigilant, avoiding a descent into excessive desire that could lead him to fall as a Corrupted Warrior.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Corrupted Warrior could be even stronger than warriors, but Alexander didn't want to dwell on the dark side.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Boss, look... I'm still pink here... I've never been with a man before..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cloe released her soft curves from her bra, showing them to Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Desire ignited in Alexander as he took one in each hand, playing with them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah! Be gentle..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cloe melted against Alexander, her body soft as water.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander channeled the Force, running his hands over Cloe's delicate frame, leaving a rosy blush on her fair skin...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cloe was breathless, her whole body soft and yielding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Cloe, that thong is really something. I can barely tell it's there until I pull it aside."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander clicked his tongue in admiration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite her boldness, Cloe was too shy to lift her head in the face of Alexander's teasing words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She took the initiative with Alexander partly out of gratitude and partly out of fear of losing his support.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Boss, stop teasing... hurry up..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cloe couldn't hold back any longer, lifting her legs and wrapping her hands around them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander, already filled with excitement, moved in without hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a full hour, Alexander trembled slightly, then relaxed, leaning back against the bed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cloe was so fulfilled it felt heavenly; she lay on Alexander's chest, breathing heavily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Smack!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander gave her a light slap on her round hips, gesturing to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cloe understood immediately. She knelt down obediently, carefully helping to clean him up without a hint of hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Boss, at first I thought the taste was strange, but now I've started to really like it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She leaned in, took a deep breath, and eagerly began to taste him.</span></p><div class="pagination">
