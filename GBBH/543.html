  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The hotel owner walked towards the restaurant tremblingly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If dozens of people died here, his hotel would definitely not be able to continue operating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He peeked at the restaurant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To his surprise, there was nothing unusual, and the bloody scene he had imagined did not appear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander had already noticed him, but he just smiled and ignored him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just now, he had used the Force Burning. After he became an Intermediate Warrior, the Force Burning became even more magical.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All the bodies and bloodstains had been burned away, leaving the floor entirely unharmed.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brittany and the others widened their eyes and stared at Alexander as if he were a monster.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hoson</span><span> was now so thoroughly convinced by Alexander that he dared not think of anything else.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander glanced at him, and </span><span>Hoson</span><span> immediately squared himself and said respectfully, "Please let me know if you need anything."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander replied calmly, "Johnathan's territory will be handed over to you for management. I hope you won't let me down."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hoson</span><span> trembled with surprise and delight.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You can go now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander waved his hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a moment of hesitation, </span><span>Hoson</span><span> said with a flattering smile, "I have also prepared some small gifts. Please accept them."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander, who was to accompany Ashley, grew a little impatient.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brittany shouted icily, "No need. Go away!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I-I carefully selected these gifts. They are all top-notch, one in a million. I put in a lot of effort," </span><span>Hoson</span><span> insisted. It seemed that the gifts were unusual.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander finally asked, "What gifts?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hoson's</span><span> face was covered in cold sweat. He had no choice but to quickly ask someone to bring in the gifts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a while, a dozen young beauties came gracefully in and lined up in front of Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were stunning women of various styles with pleasant voices and scents.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander couldn't help laughing while Brittany and Rosalia both frowned with displeasure and glared at </span><span>Hoson</span><span> fiercely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hoson</span><span> became embarrassed, thinking that he had prepared the wrong gifts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Look, this lady is from the art department of </span><span>Kingsdon</span><span> University. She's 19 years old, 5.7 feet tall, and 115 pounds, with a perfect figure. She's still a virgin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This lady has just entered the modeling circle and has also starred in several musicals. Despite her lack of popularity, she is indeed striking. Look at her body, she's voluptuous...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And this lady is pretty, too. She is the general manager of an economic company, 24 years old, sensible and considerate..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hoson</span><span> introduced the women to Alexander enthusiastically, and he would be happy as long as Alexander accepted one of them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander sized them up. Frankly, they were all top-notch beauties.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each of them could be a stunner, attracting endless men.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their looks, figures, and identities were truly impeccable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately, Brittany and Rosalia were both there. Although they understood that a man would not have only one woman, it would definitely annoy them if Alexander chose a woman openly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So</span><span> he just took a quick glance and then waved his hand to refuse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I appreciate your kindness. Let them go back."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, these beauties were filled with disappointment. Some of them had been hired by </span><span>Hoson</span><span> with large sums of money, and some of them planned to use him to hook up with the real big shots.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing how respectful and polite </span><span>Hoson</span><span> was to Alexander, they realized that Alexander was a real big shot and that he was young and handsome.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were all very satisfied with Alexander, expecting to have a wonderful night with him or even be kept by him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, he didn't even like any of them!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hoson</span><span> was stunned and quickly showed his trump card.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is a famous online celebrity in </span><span>Kingsdon</span><span>, Ophelia Snyder, who has millions of fans."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was indeed very gorgeous with an alluring look and a sexy, hot body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unlike other women, in addition to her beauty and figure, she had a star-like aura because, as a well-known online celebrity, she had been through a lot.</span></p><div class="pagination">
