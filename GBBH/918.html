He didn't expect that Elaine was simply a lunatic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In fact, Elaine was not like this to every man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had been alone for several days. And in this special environment, she felt even more stimulated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In addition, Alexander's body was so great that Elaine felt excited when she saw such a penis.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She said, "Please. I've told you everything. What are you waiting for? Please fuck me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elaine was going crazy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smiled contemptuously, pushed her down, folded her thighs in front of her chest, exposing her body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He launched a furious attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander had no intention of being gentle with her, because she was not his woman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As his strength grew, it became impossible for a woman to hold on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Ava and Lynn were so exhausted by the end that they could not move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander would make Elaine unforgettable!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elaine clutched the bed sheets tightly with both hands. And her breasts moved rapidly back and forth with the impact.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Screams and pleas for mercy, along with the crisp sounds of impact and the gurgling sound of running water echoed in the bathroom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elaine was feeling both pain and pleasure, shaking her head uncontrollably. She was already in a frenzy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She screamed. And a black pill fell from between her fingernails onto the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a highly poisonous substance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elaine tried so hard to seduce Alexander because she wanted to find an opportunity to poison Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she never expected that Alexander was so strong that she experienced unprecedented happiness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Yinson and Salman were far from making her as happy as she was now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elaine was driven by strong desire and satisfaction and gave up using poison.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, she didn't know that Alexander had already discovered the poison. She did not use it, thus saving herself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander sneered and thought, "What a vicious bitch!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He suddenly stopped. Elaine gasped for breath and urged impatiently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't stop! Please, don't stop..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander ordered coldly. "Look into my eyes!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Driven by desire, Elaine obeyed Alexander's words and quickly looked at Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Elaine felt like she was struck by lightning, and her mind went blank.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander used the Force to control Elaine, while speeding up the swing of his waist, sprinting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elaine grabbed Alexander's arm tightly with both hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said, "Remember! From now on, you will be my most loyal and humble slave!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's voice echoed in Elaine's ears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The pleasure invaded Elaine's consciousness, causing her mental defenses to collapse, and she was completely controlled by Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander used the Force to infinitely amplify the pleasure that Elaine could feel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, Elaine shivered with pleasure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She collapsed on the ground, muttering.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Master, I am your most loyal and humble slave!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the cell, Melin and the others were waiting impatiently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, there was the expected knock on the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melin was startled at first, then overjoyed, and quickly opened the door to let Alexander in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Elaine followed Alexander in, everyone was stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smiled and comforted them. "Don't be afraid. Dr. Bell is our friend now. She will help us destroy the immortality potion and the base!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone was stunned.</span></p><div class="pagination">
