  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two brothers picked a stone house that looked decent from the outside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Time to spill some blood," Alexander said with a mischievous grin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He walked over to a small tree beside the house and snapped off a thin branch. Holding it between his teeth, he picked at them a few times.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There! My gums are bleeding," he announced triumphantly. He smeared a bit of blood onto his bronze badge, which immediately glowed with a faint yellow light. "Done! That was easy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I am incredible!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He threw his hands up and gazed at the sky with an intense, almost mysterious look.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Logan laughed "Alexander... good for you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once both had marked their badges with blood, they slotted them into the bronze-shaped indent beside the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The numbers on their badges appeared on the stone door, which then swung open automatically. They stepped inside and shut the door behind them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dawn was breaking. Pale light streamed in through the small windows, casting soft shadows inside the room. The interior was well-equipped, with stone tables, stools, and beds, along with bedding and simple linen tunics. Strangely, not a speck of dust could be seen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a night of exhaustion, fear, and tension, they collapsed onto their beds and instantly fell into a deep sleep.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A loud commotion jolted them awake.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Time for work! Hurry up and eat, work starts soon!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A delicious aroma drifted through the air. Their stomachs grumbled in response. Without wasting a second, they jumped out of bed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They took off their short-sleeved shirts and changed into the linen tunics and long pants provided in the room. Once dressed, they opened the stone door, retrieved their badges, and watched as the door shut itself behind them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Outside, the place was bustling with life. People filled the streets.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Some were brushing their teeth with small wooden sticks dipped in white powder. Others stripped to the waist, scooped water from wells, and poured it over themselves in quick, refreshing washes. Children ran past, shrieking with laughter as they played.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lining the stone-paved roads were several wooden carts. Each had a large steaming pot and several wooden barrels filled with oatmeal porridge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A crowd gathered around the carts, holding plates and bread, enjoying their breakfast.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander and Logan hurried over to one of the carts and picked up some utensils. They ladled themselves plates of porridge and grabbed a few pieces of bread from a nearby basket. Following everyone else's lead, they squatted on the roadside and dug in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is good!" Logan said through a mouthful of food.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander shot him a glance before taking a bite of his bread. To his surprise, it was filled with jam. The bread was soft and fragrant, the jam sweet and refreshing. It was delicious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even the porridge had a rich, pleasant taste.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Looks like this church actually treats people well," Alexander thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Next to them squatted a young man in linen clothes. He glanced at Logan before turning to Alexander. "New here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smiled. "Yeah. Just call me Alexander."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm Jalen Cavill. I'm older than you, so I'll take care of you guys from now on."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thanks. Do you know why they gave us Arhat Fist? And what's the name of this church?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jalen grinned. "To beat up watermelon thieves, of course! This place is under divine protection. It's called Dominion Church. And let me tell you, everyone here is skilled. You wouldn't believe it until you see it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smirked. "That impressive, huh?" He took another bite. "Mmm, this is good... Hey, Jalen..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jalen continued, "Here, the men work in the fields. The women stay home and take care of the chores."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under the warm morning sun, the three of them chatted happily by the roadside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The atmosphere was peaceful and lively.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Gather up! Gather up!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Several men, clearly overseers, shouted at the crowd from ahead. The three of them quickly put down their plates and followed the others toward the manor's entrance. A massive open space stretched out before them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jalen pulled Alexander and Logan into a line.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander scanned the area. The space was huge&mdash;at least twice the size of a football field. The ground was smooth, covered in fine gravel. At the front, a large earthen platform stood several yards high. A few overseers and about a dozen laborers stood on top of it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The field in front of them was packed with people. If Logan's badge number was 10250, then that meant there were at least ten thousand workers here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ten thousand people just for growing watermelons? Dominion Church really goes all out," Alexander thought, astonished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A towering man in an overseer's uniform stepped forward and bellowed, "Silence!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The murmuring crowd fell quiet. The man surveyed the gathering before speaking again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"In three months, we will be handing over our Verdant Crown Melons to the church. If any of you slack off and fail to meet the quota..." He let the threat hang for a moment before his lips curled into a sneer. "I'll report you to The Inspection Office. You'll be stripped of your status and thrown out of the church!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
