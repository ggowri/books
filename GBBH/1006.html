  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Oliver personally led a team of officers to the scene, slapping cuffs on Lilian, Julian, and Elliot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander had already dispersed half of the profits from the magic powder to several top bosses in the empire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, with this massive scandal erupting, Oliver knew he had to get to the bottom of it. If he didn't, his position would be in serious jeopardy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliot, the cowardly man, desperately cried, "Alexander, I was wrong! I'm your uncle! Please, let me go..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander sighed but didn't even spare him a second glance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thanks to you!" Ava said, her voice trembling as tears welled up in her beautiful eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her gratitude wasn't just for the way Alexander had handled Elliot and the others. It was deeper than that. It was for standing by her side through all the turmoil, especially the looming threat of Grace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grace's status and connections could indeed bring significant advantages to Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After mulling it over, Ava decided to keep it to herself that Grace had come to see her, choosing not to mention it to Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander grinned, his mood lightening as he nudged Ava's plump breasts with his elbow in a teasing gesture.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey! Everyone's watching. What are you doing?" Ava blushed, her cheeks flushing a deep red.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, look at your shirt..." Alexander said with a mischievous grin, pointing with his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without realizing it, Ava had undone two buttons on her white shirt, and her ample breasts were nearly spilling out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had been standing so close that Alexander hadn't missed a single detail. Not only that, but he could also smell her intoxicating fragrance that drove him wild.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava glanced down and instantly noticed a glaring hole in her shirt. With a swift motion, she covered it with her hands, a flush of embarrassment coloring her cheeks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who told you to sneak a peek, you rascal?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander chuckled, "Well, let me sneak a peek when we get home tonight."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava sighed deeply and declared embarrassedly, "If you hadn't arrived today, I really don't know what I would have done. I was so worried, especially about Ashley getting into trouble."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her voice cracked, and tears began to stream down her face. The self-blame in her words cut Alexander like a knife. He could see how deeply this had affected her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander said softly, putting his arm around her shoulder, "Hey, don't worry. Nothing's going to happen to us, alright? I promise, no one can hurt you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Since the Vance family refuses to back down, then they can't blame me for what comes next. I'll make sure they understand what it means to regret!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava felt a pang of concern. The Vance family wasn't just any ordinary family. They were a powerful force in the </span><span>Kingsdon</span><span>, and taking them on would be no small feat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just be careful," she said. "The Vance family is formidably powerful. Promise me you'll be careful. Let's go pick up Ashley from kindergarten. I'm worried something might happen to her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Good!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They drove to the kindergarten.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If the Vance family wants to play dirty, don't blame me for being ruthless."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander sneered as he gripped the steering wheel, his eyes gleaming with a deadly chill that could rival the frostiest polar ice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ashley!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as Alexander pulled up to the kindergarten, Ava rushed out, clutching Ashley to her chest as if her world depended on it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander watched with a sense of satisfaction curling in his gut. Without a word, he gave a sharp hand signal to Augusta, who had been tailing them from a distance. Augusta paled as he registered the signal and thought, "The Vance family had no idea what was coming; a storm was about to break, and blood would flow in its wake."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That evening, at the Ultimate Alliance's headquarters, everything appeared eerily calm. On the surface, it was just another quiet night, but beneath the stillness, danger simmered like a coiled snake.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The grand hall was brightly lit, yet an unsettling silence hung in the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Betty sat at the bar, her fingers drumming slowly against the polished wood as she nursed a glass of whiskey.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just now, a group of mysterious assailants had launched a surprise attack on the Ultimate Alliance's headquarters, leaving carnage in their wake. The alliance had taken heavy hits.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>According to intelligence, the raid had been orchestrated by none other than the Vance family, led by Asher.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Betty received a direct order from Alexander, "Do not resist. Let them in. Draw them deeper."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her stomach churned with worry. Allowing the enemy to penetrate their defenses could lead to devastating losses among her men.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Terrible! Damn it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A subordinate burst through the door, his breath coming in short, ragged gasps. Sweat plastered his hair to his forehead and trickled down his flushed cheeks, while his clothes were now marred with the stark splatters of blood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Betty asked coldly, "What is it? Stop stammering and spit it out!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man ran up to her, gasping for breath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We just got word that the Vance family torched our northern warehouse. The losses are massive!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Betty's grip tightened around the whiskey glass, her knuckles whitening. Her breathing grew heavier, her chest rising and falling with rapid intensity. A fierce, unyielding anger flashed across her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Philip," she growled. "Tell me exactly what the Vance family has destroyed so far!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Three bars, a casino, and four warehouses. The losses are piling up. We're taking a massive hit!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Philip's face contorted into a grimace, his eyes blazing with a tempest of fury, yet beneath that storm, there flickered a trace of fear.</span></p><div class="pagination">
