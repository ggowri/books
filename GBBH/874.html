  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Surround them, and don't let them run away!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Matteo waved his hand and was ready to fight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Being a swinger, he wouldn't miss such an amazing beauty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Norma was not afraid at all. Instead, she giggled and hid behind Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She didn't even reveal her identity to see how he would protect her for psychological satisfaction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander laughed, never expecting to be targeted even when he was with the leader of the Dragon Gang.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Men were really lustful!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Matteo chuckled triumphantly, "Are you scared now? You just hit me. There's no point laughing. Unless you hand over your woman and apologize to me... Ouch!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before finishing his words, he suddenly screamed, covered his stomach, and knelt down in front of Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>No one present saw how Alexander made his move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They stood there in shock with their eyes wide open.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Damn it, why don't you beat him up? Come on. Let's teach him a lesson!" Matteo roared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They came back to their senses and tried to fight Alexander, howling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, before even touching him, they were all kicked away and rolled on the beach.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A dozen bikini girls trembled nonstop and gazed at him in fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"How useless!" Alexander snorted contemptuously. Then, she took Norma's hand and stepped directly over those men.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A few unlucky guys screamed in pain, "Ouch! It hurts!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Wow, this is so fun..." Norma smiled very happily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With her cute appearance, she looked nothing like the leader of the Dragon Gang but more like a jubilant college girl.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She pointed at those women and asked, "Would you like to select a few to board our yacht?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Them?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander was speechless. For ordinary men, those women with curvy figures and good looks were beauties.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But in his eyes, they were all nothing, and he had no interest in them at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Am I that lascivious? Let's go!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander glared at Norma.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She stuck out her tongue in fright and whispered to herself, "Don't men all like to have as many women as possible? You are so capable. You can find a few more women. I have no objection and will strongly support you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She looked serious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander was at a loss for words. The women from Risun really had different thoughts and could accept men having multiple women.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Let's go. Don't let your imagination run wild."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander strode towards the yacht in front.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Slow down. Wait for me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Norma quickly trotted after him, her breasts trembling. She looked very charming.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They walked away one after the other.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At that moment, Matteo and his companions finally recovered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Hunter, your father is a member of the Sakra Society. We must take revenge!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Staring at the receding figures of Alexander and Norma, everyone felt resentful and encouraged Matteo to retaliate against them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They were used to following Matteo's bullying and being arrogant and domineering and had never suffered such a blow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Damn! I won't let that bastard off. I promise I will kill him today. When he returns to the dock, it will be time for him to go to hell. I promise!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Matteo's expression was extremely fierce. Being beaten like this in public was a great shame and humiliation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He was determined to avenge this!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Norma led Alexander onto a large luxury yacht.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The yacht was twice as big as Matteo's. Apart from a few waiters and the captain, there were only Alexander and Norma on the yacht.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>White clouds were floating in the clear sky, and the blue sea was boundless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the picturesque scenery, a luxury yacht was speeding on the sea, creating waves of snow-white waves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the wheelhouse, Alexander asked the captain to take a rest and took control of the steering wheel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Never having sailed a yacht like this before, he wanted to give it a try.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He started accelerating. The speed of the yacht increased dramatically, and waves splashed at the stern.</span></p><div class="pagination">
