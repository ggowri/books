  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What? What did you just say? Do you have a special medicine to eliminate the plague?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The soldiers present were all shocked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ambrose was stunned at first, then burst into laughter. "It turns out that he's a lunatic!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The soldiers were talking about it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Could it be an expert who arrived late?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How is that possible? This guy must be here to defraud money."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I think he has bad intentions. He must be arrested and interrogated strictly!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ambrose became impatient and pointed his gun at Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll give you one last chance, hold your head, and squat down!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get out of the way. I don't have time to waste on you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander waved casually.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amid-st</span><span> the screams, Ambrose and several soldiers seemed to have been blown down by a raging hurricane.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not only did they fly up, but even the guns fell away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Open..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Ambrose could even utter the word "fire", his pupils suddenly contracted, and he stared at Alexander, who appeared in front of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He really wanted to order his men to shoot, but Alexander had already picked him up and blocked him in front of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If the soldiers opened fire, the first person to die would definitely be Ambrose.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was dumbfounded and didn't expect that he would become the other party's hostage so soon. It was really embarrassing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you don't want him to die, get out of my way!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander carried Ambrose and strode forward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The soldiers standing in front felt a terrifying force crushing them. They could only retreat and did not dare to shoot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were in a panic, and Alexander took the opportunity to stride into the hospital.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ambrose was terrified and looked pale.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosalia, who had been staying in the car, had a very interesting expression on her face. Alexander was becoming more and more powerful, and his aura alone could intimidate many people.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne, come on, quickly eliminate the plague!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She prayed and was full of expectations for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this time, the pathological anatomy room of the hospital was temporarily set up as a critical care center, accommodating dozens of critically ill patients.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, the identities of these patients were not ordinary. They were all well-known figures in Loscity, either rich or noble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The plague was so contagious that even though the wealthy areas had strict epidemic prevention measures, many people were eventually infected.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eddy took Elaine and the expert group on a tour.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The doctors and nurses from Loscity Hospital followed obediently behind, not daring to say a word.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The most famous among these experts was Elaine, followed by Steve McLean, a representative of the medical community in Loscity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The ancestors of the McLean family came to Loscity more than 100 years ago and had been working as doctors ever since. It was a recognized medical family in Loscity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steve was the representative figure of the McLean family. He was very famous in the medical community in Loscity and had his own unique insights into medicine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this time, several experts had begun to express their opinions and views.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone agreed that the plague was terrible and there was no particularly effective treatment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Apart from city lockdown, quarantine, and symptomatic treatment, they had not come up with any useful solutions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone frowned, and the atmosphere was very solemn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one noticed that Alexander had appeared silently behind them and was listening to their analysis of the situation with great interest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As a result, he became more and more disappointed the more he listened. He didn't expect that the so-called expert group had only such limited ability.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If people placed their hopes on these people, perhaps all of them in Loscity would die.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, someone asked, "Dr. McLean, the McLean family is a local medical family in Loscity. Don't you have any good ideas?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steve frowned and smiled awkwardly, "Just because the McLean family is from Loscity, does that mean we can come up with a good solution? What kind of bandit logic is this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A brown-haired man sneered, "I knew there were no outstanding people in Loscity. The so-called medical family is nothing but a fraud who deceives the world and steals the reputation. Maybe this plague was caused by something bad done by the people of Loscity."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander originally wanted to listen more, but he was very upset because this guy discriminated against Loscity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stood up and rebuked wryly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What qualifications do you have to slander Loscity?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's powerful and magnetic voice echoed, immediately attracting everyone's attention.</span></p><div class="pagination">
