  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cleveland let out a cold snort and gathered his energy. His massive body swelled as his muscles tensed. In an instant, he lunged forward, covering several yards in a single step. His fist shot out toward Alexander's face with terrifying speed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Arhat Fist!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's brows furrowed. He steadied his breathing, keeping his mind calm. His martial core pulsed with power, sending energy surging through his body. His muscles tightened and expanded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the critical moment, he stepped back, ducking low. Using a maneuver from Arhat Fist, he twisted his body and slipped beneath Cleveland's outstretched arm, narrowly avoiding the strike.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seizing the opening, he pivoted sharply. His waist twisted, spine coiling like a spring before releasing with explosive force. His arm swung around, fist cutting through the air with a sharp whistle, aiming for Cleveland's back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cleveland's heart pounded. Sensing danger, he hastily turned his body. His shoulders jerked, barely dodging the blow. Without missing a beat, he surged forward, arms twisting and locking around Alexander in an iron grip.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a swift hook of his foot, Cleveland threw his full weight into the move, attempting to hurl Alexander to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander felt his balance shift. He inwardly admired Cleveland's skill.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead of resisting, he let his body go limp, allowing himself to be thrown.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, with a sudden roar, he tightened his grip, latching onto Cleveland's arms with all his strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cleveland tried again to slam Alexander down, but this time, it didn't work.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander used the momentum, stabilizing himself just before impact. His feet planted firmly on the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He drove his legs forward, stepping between Cleveland's stance, and locking himself in place. His energy surged.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a powerful thrust, he slammed his forehead straight into Cleveland's chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A sickening crack rang out. Cleveland's ribs shattered. Blood spurted from his mouth as his body crumpled to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander strode forward and yanked off Cleveland's face covering. "I knew it was you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The fight had ended in mere seconds. Rory stood frozen. Their movements had been too fast, a blur of motion he could barely follow. By the time he grasped what had happened, Cleveland was already lying on the ground, coughing up blood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Panic surged through him. He thought, "Mr. Wheeler ate the Verdant Crown Melon. I heard he became a level-one warrior. How could he lose?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He dropped his iron spear and bolted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Logan was faster. He dashed forward, catching up in a few strides. With a fierce shout, he struck Rory down with a single punch. Picking up the fallen spear, Logan pressed its tip against Rory's throat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, should we just kill him?" He made a slicing motion across his neck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rory's face turned ashen. "No... please, spare me! It wasn't my idea! Cleveland forced me! I have a family..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander chuckled. "Rory, take Cleveland and get out of here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander..." Logan shot him a displeased look, clearly reluctant to let them go. But Alexander remained firm. Seeing no other choice, Logan lowered the spear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rory, terrified they might change their minds, scrambled to his feet. He hoisted Cleveland onto his back and staggered toward the manor without looking back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, if you let them go, what if they come back for revenge?" Logan asked frustration in his voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Cleveland is finished." Alexander's gaze darkened. "And don't forget, we're in Dominion Church territory. If we kill someone, the consequences will be severe."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes drifted to the distant silhouette of Dominion Church's grand tower. He clenched his fists.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Am I really from this world? What are Warriors and Ava? I will find out."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rory carried Cleveland back to the manor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a long time before Cleveland regained consciousness. Weakly, he fumbled for a small bottle and downed half of its contents.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was "Mending Powder," a rare life-saving elixir from the Hall of Lives within Dominion Church.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had only managed to obtain a single bottle thanks to Donald. Its effects were nothing short of miraculous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Within minutes, some color returned to his face. He coughed up a few mouthfuls of clotted blood and felt slightly better. "Rory," he rasped, voice weak. "Take my identity token... go to Mr. Wachtell."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, Mr. Wheeler! Just rest!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rory grabbed the token and sprinted toward Dominion Church's Top Court.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, Donald arrived at Emerald Manor and entered Cleveland's quarters.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Placing a hand on Cleveland's chest, he began chanting in a deep, rhythmic tone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His voice carried an eerie calm, spreading a strange sense of peace through the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For over an hour, Cleveland remained motionless, absorbing the healing energy. When Donald finally stopped, Cleveland took a long, shuddering breath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You'll live," Donald said grimly. "But your ribs are shattered. Even if you recover, your days of training are over."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His tone grew sharp. "What happened? I gave you a Verdant Crown Melon! You were supposed to become a level-one warrior!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
