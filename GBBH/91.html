  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Meanwhile, Alexander was deep in conversation with Billy and Betty.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Betty shot Billy a cold glance before leaning in close to Alexander, whispering something in his ear.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Billy immediately felt uneasy, his mind racing with the thought, "She couldn't have found out about that, could she?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander nodded slowly, then turned his gaze to Billy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"The sales of the magic powder have been good lately, but why has the cash flow dropped by ten percent?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Billy wiped the sweat from his brow, forcing a nervous smile. "Boss, you said we should unite our strengths to completely crush the Brilliant Group, right? So, I took the liberty of lowering the supply prices for the Cripples, the Blood Gang, and the Kaylon..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Liar!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander slammed his hand on the table, causing Billy to collapse in sheer panic.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He hung his head, but his eyes darted around, searching for a way out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The truth was, he hadn't lowered any prices; instead, he had pocketed a chunk of the payments&mdash; tens of millions of dollars, in fact.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Billy thought as long as he kept things under wraps, no one would ever know.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Are you trying to deceive me?" Alexander growled, grabbing Billy by the throat and lifting him off the ground.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Billy gasped for air, struggling desperately, but he couldn't budge Alexander even an inch.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The grip tightened, and the sheer force made Billy's eyes bulge in terror.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Please... spare me..." Billy managed to choke out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander said, his voice cold and menacing, "Listen closely. This is your first and last warning. You will return double the amount you've embezzled and keep your little schemes to yourself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You've lived for decades; don't you understand that in this world, power is everything? Be careful, or you might just earn yourself a grave instead of a paycheck."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With that, Alexander threw Billy roughly to the ground.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Billy gasped, gulping down the precious air as he lay there, trying to regain his composure.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Boss, I messed up. I promise I won't do it again..." Billy pleaded, absolutely convinced that Alexander had meant business.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander shot him a frigid glance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You have made enough as the middleman. People can't be too greedy."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Billy nodded vigorously. "Yes, yes! I owe everything to you, boss. I was just too greedy. I won't let it happen again!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Get lost!" Alexander waved him off.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Billy didn't dare utter another word and hurriedly left the room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As he walked out, he clenched his jaw, a glint of malice in his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He thought, "It's all Betty's fault. If it weren't for her, Alexander wouldn't have discovered it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Once Billy's footsteps faded down the hallway, Alexander turned his attention back to Betty.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You did well."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Betty's eyes sparkled with delight. "Boss, it was the least I could do. But Billy? He's treacherous and greedy, definitely not someone worth keeping around. He'll cause trouble sooner or later."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander scoffed, saying, "He has ulterior motives because Sebastian's in Loscity. And as for him being a lecher? Did he make a pass at you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Betty blushed, nodding slightly. "I didn't let him get away with it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander slammed his hand on the table again, frustration boiling over. "He dares to touch my people? He's got a death wish."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Unable to resist, Betty leaned into Alexander, her voice soft and soothing. "Boss, with you by my side, I won't be tempted by any other man."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her curvy figure pressed against his chest, and the softness of her body was intoxicating.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">To make matters worse, Betty's hands began to wander, teasingly inching down, as if she were about to unfasten his pants.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Though Alexander felt a rush of desire, he mustered every ounce of the Force, forcing himself to suppress his urges.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Betty, set up a networking event and notify all the companies and families in Loscity, big and small. Anyone interested in becoming a distributor of magic powder should come.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"At the event, I'll appoint the Saint Group as the main distributor and form an alliance with the four major families of Loscity&mdash;the Cripples, the Blood Gang, and the Kaylon&mdash;to create a nationwide sales network.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"The benefits of magic powder will tightly bind everyone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"A mere Sebastian? Even if it's Guzman from the Brilliant Group, he won't be able to withstand the combined might of so many forces!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Betty was instantly fired up, recognizing the magnitude of the task.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She quickly went to make arrangements.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As she was about to leave, she cast a wistful glance back and playfully scolded, "Boss, when will you ever spend some time with me?"</p><div class="pagination">
