  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The name "Alexander" was now a thorn in Guzman's side, and the Red Umbrella Group was lurking nearby, ready to pounce. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Guards, arrest Cloe and strip her of her rights!" he ordered without hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The men in black hesitated briefly before moving to restrain Cloe. Guzman sighed deeply. "Cloe, I've raised you for over twenty years. It pains me that you've made a mistake. I have no choice but to use you as a sacrifice..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the mention of "sacrifice," Cloe's face turned pale with horror. Guzman practiced witchcraft, and every month, a woman was sacrificed for his rituals&mdash;a gruesome reality that haunted Cloe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dad, why are you doing this to me? Is this really happening?" Cloe's voice shook with fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Guzman showed no emotion, his eyes a mix of complex feelings before hardening. He had adopted Cloe because she was perfect for the ritual. He had kept her isolated, forbidding her from relationships to ensure she remained a virgin for the sacrifice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Alexander and the Red Umbrella Group closing in, Guzman couldn't delay any longer. "Cloe, this is final. Your sacrifice is your way to repay me for raising you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His tone was cold, devoid of any fatherly warmth. The room was tense, and while some felt sorry for Cloe, no one dared to speak against Guzman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He addressed the group, "You are all part of the Bryant family. We're facing a minor challenge now, but once I become a white wizard, the City of Sorcery will support us, and the Brilliant Group will thrive even more!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The tension eased, and the sympathy for Cloe vanished. Some even began to persuade </span><span>her. "Cloe, if Mr. Bryant hadn't taken you in, you might be living a life of hardship. You owe him everything."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, it's time to give back. Your sacrifice will be honored."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Cloe, thank you for your sacrifice. We'll ensure you're remembered properly."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"With your help, our family will reach new heights!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Bryant family members chimed in, their smiles betraying their excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You beasts! You're all monsters. You should be the ones sacrificed!" Cloe yelled, struggling in vain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The group ignored her, turning to congratulate Guzman. "Mr. Bryant, congratulations on your upcoming advancement!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Guzman raised his hand for silence. "Prepare the altar! The ritual begins now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Guzman's command, everyone grew solemn. Guzman stood </span><span>tall,</span><span> his gaze fixed on Cloe with a fierce intensity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A steel wall in the room slid open with a series of clicks, revealing a black scepter taller than a man. At its top sat a real human skull, not just a model.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the scepter appeared, the room dimmed, as if the light itself was being absorbed. A faint smell of blood and an ominous energy emanated from the scepter, filling the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Alexander was taken aback, and the expressions of those present turned pale as they bowed their heads deeply.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Guzman gestured, and two burly men in black dragged Cloe to kneel before the scepter.</span></p><div class="pagination">
