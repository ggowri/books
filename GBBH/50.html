  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava gazed at Alexander, her eyes soft and full of emotion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She hadn't expected Alexander to grow so bold, daring to touch her thigh and showing signs of wanting to go further.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Are you sure about being with me? The Saint Group is facing powerful enemies. As CEO, I have no way out. Aren't you afraid?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava stared intently at Alexander.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander fought back a smile, thinking he should be the one on the hot seat as chairman.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'm not afraid!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava placed her hand over Alexander's, shaking her head.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"We can't move this fast. I trust you, but I need to see how you perform. I hope you can pass the test."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander asked curiously, "What kind of test?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava just smiled mysteriously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay, keep your secrets. I'm confident you'll genuinely accept me soon enough."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander's self-assured and spirited demeanor set Ava's heart racing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava pulled Alexander in for a passionate kiss before watching him step out of the car and head into the mansion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As Ava's car vanished into the night, Alexander settled into a meditative pose to practice his Force techniques.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Unfortunately, without access to the cosmic realm, his progress was frustratingly slow.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The night slipped away unnoticed...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander felt only the faintest increase in his Force powers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Still, his Novice Warrior skills were adequate for now. If he could craft a Lightsaber, his combat prowess would reach new heights.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just as he pondered how to gather materials for the Lightsaber, two cars pulled up outside.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Billy stepped out, followed by several lackeys carrying an assortment of gifts.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander peered through the window, watching Billy's group approach, his mind churning.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Anne was taking her sweet time gathering materials, and Alexander wasn't about to rush her. Lightsabers were his ace in the hole, and the fewer people who knew about them, the better.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Billy could come in handy. He'd put him on the task of collecting the materials for crafting Lightsabers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When Alexander opened the door, Billy immediately bowed deeply, showing utmost respect.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mr. Hawthorne, I've come to thank you for saving my life. If you hadn't stepped in last night, I'd have been at the mercy of The Cripples."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander chuckled, "I'm sure you didn't come all this way just to thank me. What else is on your mind?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Billy's face reddened, and he smiled ingratiatingly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Nothing escapes your notice, sir. At the ball, you mentioned taking me on as your subordinate. Was that offer genuine?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If you don't take me in, I fear The Cripples won't let me off easy. The Blood Gang is even worse. They'll bleed you dry. They take favors but never truly help..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Billy griped bitterly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander remained noncommittal, neither refusing nor accepting.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At his wit's end, Billy thumped his chest emphatically.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mr. Hawthorne, if I become your man, I'll give you a third of all earnings from my territory. That's about three million dollars a year."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander pondered for a moment before replying.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I can ensure your safety, but I want half the profits."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Half of it would be around five million dollars, which was mere pocket change for the Saint Group, with its annual profits in the billions of dollars.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander gradually understood a crucial lesson. Only the power he indeed controlled belonged to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He might appear to be the chairman of the Saint Group, but with just one word from his estranged father, even Anne could strip away his position.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">That was why Alexander had invested so much effort in winning over William and Betty.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Now, with Billy added to the mix, he could form the foundation of his power base.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Billy hesitated for a few seconds before finally gritting his teeth and agreeing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Half it is, boss. From now on, I'll do whatever you say!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He turned and waved to his men. "What are you all standing around for? Pay your respects to the boss!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Over a dozen men immediately dropped to one knee before Alexander.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander nodded with satisfaction.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Billy, I need you to collect meteorites containing metal. Don't worry about the cost. I'll pay top dollar for quality goods."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Billy was taken aback. He wondered if Alexander was some kind of astronomy buff.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He didn't dare ask questions, just thumped his chest and promised.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Please leave it to me, boss. I'll take care of it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just then, Jane and Belinda approached, glancing around as they walked over.</p><div class="pagination">
