If Guzman hadn't paid well enough, I wouldn't care about your lives." Drake started to withdraw his hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gritting his teeth, Sebastian quickly grabbed the beetle and popped it into his mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Crunch!" A crisp sound filled the air, accompanied by a foul, spicy taste spreading throughout his mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian was overwhelmed with nausea, his stomach churning as he began to retch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After vomiting, however, he noticed the pain in his head had significantly lessened. Though not gone, it was now bearable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you, Mr. Drake, thank you!" Overjoyed, Sebastian bowed repeatedly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan anxiously cried. "Mr. Drake, please, my hand too!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Drake examined Evan's hand, then pulled out an unfamiliar green liquid.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Drinking this will provide temporary relief, but to fully recover, you'll need to eliminate Alexander&mdash;the source of all this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's odd... what Alexander used isn't sorcery or poison." Drake frowned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The green liquid smelled pungent and rotten, but Evan didn't hesitate, pinching his nose as he drank it in two gulps.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, Evan's weakened arm began moving again. Though still numb, some mobility had returned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both Sebastian and Evan had been concerned about Drake's ability to confront Alexander, but witnessing Drake's abilities firsthand had restored their confidence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a wave of his hand, Drake said, "Arrange two cars and drivers for me. Leave the rest to me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian paused and instinctively asked, "You don't need our help?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Drake sneered. "He's just a young man. Even if he knows a few tricks, he's no match for me&mdash;probably not even for my apprentice."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian was thrilled. "Ha, Alexander, just you wait!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inside a luxurious seaside villa, pink lights filled the room, lace underwear and a bra were scattered on the floor, and soft moans echoed throughout.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The seductive sounds went from low to high, luring one's soul into a trance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The large bed shook, creaking as if struggling under the weight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Alexander moved excitedly, a sharp pain jolted him awake.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was just a dream!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rubbing his temples, he recalled the events in his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had used the Force at Saint Group to cleanse toxins from over a hundred poisoned employees, but the strain of it had caused him to pass out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Something was wrong!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander sensed a toxin in his body, but it was held in check by the Force left by James, concentrated in his abdomen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That earlier dream was due to this, and upon inspection, he noticed some redness and swelling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sitting up, he began meditating to restore his Force, knowing that once he regained his strength, the toxins could be cleared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, he heard the sound of running water from the bathroom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander paused, looking around.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was clearly a woman's bedroom&mdash;elegant and stylish, with familiar clothing scattered around.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Ava's room!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His heart pounded as his abdomen pulsed uncomfortably, the swelling in his pants becoming even more pronounced.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The bathroom door wasn't fully closed, leaving a slight gap.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking of Ava's stunning figure, her fair skin, and her enticing gaze, Alexander couldn't help but swallow hard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He moved closer, peeking through the gap.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava was showering, her back to him, her skin covered in soap bubbles, her curves tantalizingly revealed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was washing slowly, thoroughly, moving her hands with care over her body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander felt his mouth go dry, his mind going blank, captivated by the sight before him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He found himself reaching for the door handle, preparing to step in.</span></p><div class="pagination">
