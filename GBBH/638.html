  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ian, I'm going to kill him!" Two burly men sprang to their feet behind Ian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were twin brothers, resembling each other so closely that they shared the same expressions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both stood about 6.2 feet tall, with muscular builds and massive fists that radiated a menacing aura. It was obvious they had blood on their hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Take him down!" Ian ordered, waving his hand dismissively.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The twin brothers were his most trusted enforcers, and he wanted to see how they measured up against Alexander. Although Ian didn't think much of Alexander's skills, his unwavering confidence made Ian uneasy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You bastard! How dare you mess around in front of Ian?" one of the twins bellowed as he charged at Alexander, throwing a powerful punch aimed at his ear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The other brother followed right behind, unleashing a brutal kick to Alexander's groin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their punches and kicks flew swiftly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were completely convinced that Alexander wouldn't be able to evade them&mdash;after all, even the most skilled fighter would have to scramble to avoid their onslaught.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Alexander merely smiled, showing no signs of retreat or dodging. In fact, he stood there seemingly frozen in fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just when the twins thought they had him cornered, Alexander sprang into action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He caught one brother's fist with his left hand and swiftly drove his knuckles into the instep of the other brother's foot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The air was pierced by dual screams.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One twin clutched his shattered right hand while the other writhed on the ground, cradling his injured left foot in agony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a swift kick, Alexander sent both of them flying into the street's center.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, a heavy truck laden with ore rumbled by, and the twins' heads were crushed beneath its massive wheels.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Red blood and white brain marrow splattered across the pavement, sending waves of shock through the onlookers, who gasped and screamed in horror.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ian, come here and try," Alexander called out, his eyes glinting with menace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Putting aside his personal grudge against Ian, Alexander felt compelled to eliminate him simply for being part of the Mafia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This guy is no joke&mdash;he's even more skilled than Alice!" Ian muttered in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He never expected his two strongest men to be killed so effortlessly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To Alexander, they were little more than ants squashed underfoot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fear coursed through Ian, but he forced a sneer, "Alice. Looks like you've got a backer. And he's impressive."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander sensed Ian's intentions to attack at any moment, yet he knew that against his power, any attempt by Ian would be futile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ian, since you know you are outmatched, just get out of here," Alice sneered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Alexander's strength, she really didn't take Ian seriously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ian let out a wild laugh. "This is Mandale Town, not your playground. You killed my men here, and I won't let you walk away from this."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he quickly drew his gun, pointing it squarely at Alexander. The muzzle gleamed ominously in the light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With only six or seven feet separating them, he felt certain he could hit his mark every time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No matter how tough you think you are, can you dodge bullets?" Ian laughed arrogantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander looked at him with disdain. "Go ahead and try. Let's see if you can actually hit me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fuck you! You think you're faster than a bullet? Stop bragging!" Ian sneered, his grip steady on the gun&mdash;a testament to his training as a Mafia elite.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ian, he's just playing tough. Enough talk, and just shoot him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, he killed two of our guys. We need to make him pay. Otherwise, how can we hold our ground in Mandale Town?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ian's men encouraged him to pull the trigger immediately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In their eyes, Alexander was as good as dead, with no chance to evade the bullet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alice's expression darkened. While she believed in Alexander's abilities, a nagging worry crept in&mdash;after all, this was a gun they were dealing with.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The people in Mandale Town were tough, and there were many onlookers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just now, when Alexander killed two people, they watched with great interest. But now that Ian was about to shoot, they quickly retreated far away for fear of being hit by stray bullets.</span></p><div class="pagination">
