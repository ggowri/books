  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were in the midst of a vigorous discussion. Some were excited, some shook their heads, and some sighed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was a reward notice posted at the gate of the Gomez Villa, and a group of security guards stood next to it, their eyes wide open, scanning the crowd vigilantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Someone exclaimed, "The Gomez family is so rich. They offer a reward of 50 million dollars to cure Elaina!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fifty million dollars is not the point. Whoever can treat Elaina will have the opportunity to become friends with her. Later, the guy might marry her and make a fortune. The Gomez family is a wealthy family with assets of tens of billions of dollars."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Too bad I'm not a famous doctor, an expert, or a professor. Otherwise, I will definitely seize this opportunity to change my destiny."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone chatted with each other excitedly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander took a glance at the notice. Orlando must be desperate. Otherwise, he wouldn't have offered the reward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, a black Mercedes-Benz drove up, and a middle-aged man in a suit got out of the car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a black suitcase, he grinned with delight while reading the notice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Someone recognized him and kindly reminded him, "Archie, you have to think carefully. Although you are a medical expert, Ms. Elaina Gomez's strange disease is really difficult to cure!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Archie glared at the guy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I have been practicing medicine for more than 20 years, and I am now a professor. Don't I have a chance?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The guy smiled, "Archie, I don't look down on you. But have you heard of Matthew, one of the best medical experts in </span><span>Kingsdon</span><span>?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Did Matthew come here, too? No way! His professional knowledge is indeed better </span><span>than mine."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Archie was quite modest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Matthew was helpless with Elaina's illness. As a result, Orlando lost his temper on the spot, calling him a liar. In the end, Matthew was beaten out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Gomez family is originally a medical family, and Orlando is also the descendant of a famous doctor, but he couldn't treat Elaina's illness. Archie, do you really have to go in and get beaten?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While persuading Archie, the guy laughed and sized him up, obviously not optimistic about him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Archie was stunned and stammered, "If that's the case, then forget it. It turns out that the 50 million dollars is not easy to earn..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, a roar came from inside the Gomez Villa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get lost!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What an incompetent doctor!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A doctor in a white coat was pushed out viciously by a group of security guards.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing this, Archie wiped the cold sweat from his forehead, feeling glad that he did not act rashly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"More than a dozen doctors went in these few days, including a Nobel Prize winner in medicine. They were all powerless and were kicked out by Orlando."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They failed to cure Elaina and even worsened her condition, so Orlando got furious."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Although 50 million dollars is tempting and Elaina is a beautiful lady, no one can get them!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone talked about it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Some doctors from other places, who had heard the news and had come here to try their luck, immediately became dejected.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Excuse me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander squeezed through the crowd and gave it a gentle push, releasing so much force that those standing in front retreated to the sides like grass blown over by the wind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let me in. I can cure Ms. Elaina Gomez."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's confident attitude instantly caused an uproar at the scene.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone, including the Gomez family's security guards, stared at him with wide eyes, looking him up and down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing that he was so young and dressed in ordinary clothes, they immediately disdained him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Archie couldn't help but ask, "Which hospital do you work in? Which university did you graduate from?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander replied calmly, "I am not a doctor, and I have never been to medical school."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His reply caused another uproar at the scene.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can tell from his appearance that he is a real liar and definitely not a doctor."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He must want to try his luck. It doesn't cost anything anyway. Maybe he will succeed."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm afraid he will be beaten out. The Gomez family will kill such liars."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone mocked Alexander with contempt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A security guard yelled fiercely, "Damn, you're not a doctor, and you've never studied medicine. How dare you treat Ms. Elaina Gomez? Are you fucking crazy?"</span></p><div class="pagination">
