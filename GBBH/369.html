  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Porsche shot through the first curve at top speed without a hitch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What! How is that even possible?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Byron was utterly shocked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Pulling off a turn like that should only be possible on a professional track, in a high-performance race car, and with an expert driver at the wheel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet Alexander had done it, executing a flawless drift that had an indescribable elegance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As a professional racer, Byron knew the level of skill it took.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those terrifyingly perfect drifting techniques had his heart racing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it, who exactly is this guy with Rebecca? Where did he get such incredible driving skills? Could he actually be a king of the racing world?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No! It can't be... I know all the top drivers..." he muttered bitterly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Byron mumbled to himself, his expression turning sour.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, to his horror, Alexander took on several consecutive hairpin curves without slowing down, drifting through each one at top speed. The sight was both thrilling and mesmerizing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How was this even possible!?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Byron wondered if he was dreaming; everything felt unreal, beyond belief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't dare attempt those terrifying drifts and could only watch as the Porsche got farther and farther away, finally vanishing from sight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, he was only nearing the second turn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Byron's heart was filled with anger, jealousy, and frustration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He even stopped his car, furiously pounding the hood in a desperate attempt to vent his frustration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Rebecca cheered joyfully, wrapping her arms around Alexander and kissing him repeatedly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hahaha!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander laughed along, equally thrilled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they approached the Hansen Villa, Alexander eased off the accelerator.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hang in there, Grandpa. Alexander is here..." Rebecca murmured, overwhelmed with emotion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She remembered how she used to look down on Alexander and suddenly felt embarrassed, her emotions complicated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Filled with remorse, Rebecca nestled closely to Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry, leave everything to me," he said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander patted Rebecca's shoulder, and together, they headed toward the Hansen Villa's entrance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Miss, you're finally back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Thompson is here already; he's been waiting anxiously inside."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A few Hansen family members quickly came over to greet them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, you're here? Good, that means Ralph has a chance... sigh!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quentin hurried out, clearly excited.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He and Ralph had been close friends for decades, and it was why he'd rushed to </span><span>Loscity</span><span> on such short notice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Thompson..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander began to speak, but Quentin interrupted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This isn't the military. Call me Quentin, and I'll call you Alexander. I'm leaving Ralph's life in your hands; there's no time to lose."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quentin pulled Alexander inside, giving Rebecca a quick smile but saying nothing more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though Alexander and Rebecca were obviously close, Quentin wasn't surprised in the least.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a capable and handsome young man like Alexander, it would've been strange if he didn't have a few women interested in him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was also confident that his granddaughter, Brittany, would win Alexander's heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The three of them arrived at Ralph's room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ralph lay motionless in bed, surrounded by advanced medical equipment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Several doctors were working busily, their expressions grim.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander noticed beads of sweat on the doctors' foreheads; they were clearly under pressure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander is here; all of you, step aside!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quentin raised his hand authoritatively, and the doctors quickly stepped back, eyeing Alexander with curiosity and doubt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He's so young!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isn't he a bit too young to heal Ralph?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A few doctors were unconvinced and secretly hoping to see him fail.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander strode quickly to Ralph's side, activating his All-seeing Eyes to scan him closely. It's a far more precise and direct method than Force Sense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In Alexander's eyes, Ralph's entire body appeared as transparent as crystal glass.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every bone, muscle, blood vessel, and organ </span><span>was</span><span> completely visible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander noticed Ralph's liver was blackened, clearly poisoned, and it was identical </span><span>to the poison that had affected Ashley earlier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed that the Red Umbrella Group was the real power backing Orion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fortunately, he had arrived just in time; within an hour or two, Ralph would have succumbed to the poison.</span></p><div class="pagination">
