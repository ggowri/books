  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander estimated that Sally's overall combat power now rivaled that of a level-one metahuman with special abilities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the roasted meat had lost its effectiveness for her; it was clear they needed to hunt new or higher-level mutated beasts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sally nestled into Alexander's embrace, her voice playful yet earnest. "Can I get in the car now, Alexander?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her heart was full of gratitude for him, and she would do anything for this man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Alexander just chuckled and pointed ahead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's up?" Sally asked, a hint of confusion in her voice as she followed his gaze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the distance, a few zombies were staggering about, their movements erratic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"See those? Go take them out, and then you can hop in the car," Alexander instructed with a grin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sally felt a mix of excitement and trepidation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"With your current abilities, you could handle those zombies easily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even if there were twice as many, you'd still have no trouble. Go on!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He handed her a machete, his tone firm. "If you can't do this, I'll leave you behind because I don't want to carry dead weight."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sally's heart dropped at his words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was no time for hesitation now. Gripping the machete tightly, she walked toward the zombies, her pace quickening from a walk to a run.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The first target was a bald zombie, and as it spotted her, it lunged forward, eager for a meal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sally gritted her teeth, steadying her trembling hands. Before the zombie could make a move, she swung the machete at its neck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The zombie's head flew off, rolling across the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For a moment, Sally stood there, dazed by how easily she had dispatched it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was almost too simple!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come on, I'm giving you five minutes. If you don't finish, I'm leaving!" Alexander called out, urgency in his voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were six zombies in total, and five minutes was more than enough time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After taking down the first one, Sally felt a surge of confidence and charged toward the next target.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A newfound aura of strength radiated from her&mdash;her warrior spirit had awakened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The remaining zombies, startled by her sudden ferocity, began to converge on her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sally quickly assessed the situation, focusing on the nearest zombie, and sprinted toward it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Die!" she shouted, swinging the machete with determination.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, the zombie lunged, its claws extended menacingly toward her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Panic surged through Sally; she had underestimated its tenacity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If she didn't dodge its attack, they would both meet a grim fate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a swift sidestep, she evaded the zombie's grasp and, in one fluid motion, brought the machete down on its head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Watching from a distance, Alexander chuckled to himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Sally's current combat prowess, taking out these zombies was a piece of cake. If she couldn't manage it, it would show that she wasn't worth the effort to train further.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Sally swiftly dispatched the zombies, her body flooded with adrenaline.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She panted heavily, clutching her machete.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, I did it!" she exclaimed, waving her weapon triumphantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander nodded approvingly. "As long as you can face the zombies, your current abilities should suffice for self-defense."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But I still want to stay with you. Don't worry; I won't be a burden." Sally beamed, her eyes sparkling with determination.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a mix of relief and affection, she threw herself into Alexander's arms, hugging him tightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander felt Sally's ample bosom against him, causing a surge of desire in his lower regions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sally giggled seductively, sliding her hand into Alexander's pants.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without hesitation, Alexander lifted Sally onto the car seat, reclined it, and climbed on top of her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He pushed her shirt up, revealing her snow-white, enticing breasts, which he squeezed and molded to his liking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sally bit her lower lip, her face flushing crimson, her expression a mix of excitement and longing. Her voluptuous body writhed like a snake, arching into Alexander's touch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wow, so sensitive?" Alexander chuckled, his hands and lips exploring her body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't make her wait long; he shed his pants, his erection straining towards her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, the SUV shook vigorously as they engaged in passionate lovemaking, a symphony of moans filling the air.</span></p><div class="pagination">
