  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ah! I can't do it anymore... My body is numb, and I can't move..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Grace exclaimed. She herself didn't understand why she felt such a strong pleasure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Plop."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She collapsed heavily on the sofa, struggling to support herself, but her whole body was numb, and she couldn't do it at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Look at you. Even though you're a virgin, you're bolder than many women."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander looked at his fingers, which were covered with sticky liquid and gave off a strange, sweet smell.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Taste yourself."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He smeared it on Grace's face with his fingers, sliding them into her parted lips, causing her to tremble intensely once again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Grace was trembling all over. Before it really started, she had already reached two climaxes. She felt like her lower body was numb and could no longer move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Without waiting for Grace to recover, Alexander pressed her down with both hands and parted her legs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Sizzle!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The thong was torn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He unzipped his pants and moved closer, pressing against her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Suddenly, Grace let out another loud moan, and she was still in the afterglow of the last climax.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even if Alexander just touched her, she felt numb all over, as if countless ants were crawling on her body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Master... hurry up, I can't bear it anymore..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Grace begged desperately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander used the Force to wrap around Grace's sensitive parts so that she wouldn't feel too much pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander was really terrifying. Even a mature woman who had experienced it many times could not bear it, let alone Grace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But with the effect of the Force Cure, Grace would not lose pleasure because of the pain. Instead, she would have a feeling mixed with pain and pleasure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander had already planned it out. This a little painful but happy experience would make Grace even more unforgettable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Afterward, Alexander slowly started, little by little, and blood flowed down her snow-white thighs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ah!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Grace screamed. She had not yet recovered from the former pleasure and was extremely sensitive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Now that Alexander had started, she suddenly felt her body split apart, yet she was very comfortable. Her whole body was numb and it felt like soaring into the sky.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As Alexander moved, her entire body's hair stood on end. She could only moan to ease the intense pleasure within her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander admired Grace's painful yet happy appearance, and his heart filled with a sense of conquest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon, Grace's body began to adapt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>There was also the sound of cooing in the crisp sound of snapping, proving that Grace's body was fully prepared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Moreover, Grace was getting more and more relaxed. Her mind always recalled the scene when her father and mother were together, and she couldn't help but let her imagination run wild.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander was surprised by Grace's cooperation. He thought, "She is truly a natural enchantress."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander picked up Grace and let her sit astride him, with her on top.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Come on. It's up to you to control which level of happiness you want."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander smiled evilly and patted her butt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "Being young is great. Full of elasticity, nothing like those who've been with many men, with loose, saggy hips and no firmness at all."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Grace gritted her teeth, pressing both hands against Alexander's chest. She transformed into the bravest knight, rocking her hips back and forth while throwing her head back with all her might.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Grace trembled continuously with her movements, leaving Alexander feeling parched. He quickly reached out to caress her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander also felt a sense of pleasure as he watched the look of enjoyment on Grace's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He raised his upper body slightly and kissed Grace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Um..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Grace wildly shook her head and twisted her waist before suddenly wrapping her arms around Alexander's neck, pulling herself desperately closer to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander responded by arching his waist upward with force, driving Grace into an even greater frenzy as waves of pleasure surged through her, each more intense than the last.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even Alexander had to admit that Grace was different. The feeling was so comfortable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander hugged Grace's butt tightly, his fingers sinking into the soft and springy flesh of the hips, forcefully spreading them apart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His legs propped up, and he began thrusting his hips upward at a rapid pace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Grace couldn't bear it any longer, and she collapsed on Alexander, crying and moaning, falling into the endless pleasure...</span></p><div class="pagination">
