  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander smiled lightly but didn't respond immediately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Instead, he picked up a nearby helmet and tapped it gently, saying, "The protection level of this helmet is insufficient. I want the composite materials in both the bulletproof vests and helmets to include multiple layers of metal mesh, all pressed into hollow triangular micro-particles, molded as a single piece."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gabriel, clearly taken aback, responded, "Mr. Hawthorne, while this would significantly increase the protective capabilities, the production cost would be far too high&mdash;at least double. We would be operating at a loss."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander waved it off with ease, "I'm not looking to make a profit from Silver Shield Security. Tomorrow, I'll inject ten billion dollars into the company. All our protective products need to reach the highest possible levels of defense, no matter the cost."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With the potential apocalypse looming, a good set of protective gear could significantly enhance survival and combat abilities. Naturally, Alexander wasn't concerned with the cost.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ten billion dollars? No cost considerations?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone froze in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As the chief designer, Gabriel was particularly moved. With such a financially generous chairman, he finally had the freedom to push his designs to their limits.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So many of his previous creations had been constrained by the need for economic viability, unable to reach their full potential in terms of protection. But now, with Alexander at the helm, there were no such restrictions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was a designer's dream come true.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yet, a deep sense of shame also washed over him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gabriel bowed deeply to Alexander, saying, "Mr. Hawthorne, I apologize for my rashness. Thank you for your support. I will work tirelessly for Silver Shield Security."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander chuckled and patted him on the shoulder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alvin, still silent, was more surprised by something else. It wasn't just Alexander's generosity&mdash;it was the fact that Alexander had never seen the product specifications, nor had he participated in the research and development process.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yet, he had pinpointed the flaws in the bulletproof vests and helmets with such precision. How was he able to do that?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He was nothing short of a genius.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alvin was in awe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He had no idea that Alexander's abilities extended far beyond business savvy&mdash;his senses were so sharp that he could perceive things others couldn't, even identifying materials that would require a microscope.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As the meeting continued, Alexander reviewed all the products displayed in the lab, pointing out flaws in each one. Every design, no matter how meticulously crafted, had an issue that escaped the trained eyes of the designers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone was stunned, including Gabriel and Alvin, who felt both awe and a humbling sense of inadequacy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They had dedicated their careers to these designs, but Alexander seemed to have surpassed them effortlessly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Still, Alvin remained cautious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He nervously asked, "Mr. Hawthorne, if we make these changes, Silver Shield Security will definitely incur losses. Are you sure you want to proceed with this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander confidently replied, "Yes, I'm sure. I want the protection to be maximized. Don't worry about the financial side of things."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, to everyone's surprise, Alexander made another announcement that left the room in disbelief&mdash;he decided to raise everyone's salaries by fifty percent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The room fell silent for a moment, before erupting into cheers. It felt almost surreal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Was Alexander really that wealthy, with money to spare?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone was filled with newfound excitement and motivation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gabriel sighed deeply, his voice filled with genuine admiration, "I never imagined, at my age, that I'd get the chance to work with someone like Mr. Hawthorne. We are truly lucky.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I guarantee that within a year, Silver Shield Security's security products will be the best in the industry!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"We will become a world-class company!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone nodded in agreement, believing that Alexander wasn't focused on short-term profits but rather on building the company's reputation and global standing, even if it meant initial losses. It was a calculated, long-term strategy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After finalizing the acquisition of Silver Shield Security, Alexander contacted Betty, instructing her to keep in touch with Alvin and ensure that all the security products produced would be shipped to Treasure Island.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With a smile, Alexander bid his farewell, "The job's done. I'm heading back to Loscity now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Maxine, clearly lost in her own thoughts, seemed distant, her emotions difficult to conceal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Emma managed a faint smile, saying, "Thank you, Alexander. I... I don't even know how to repay you. I won't send you off, but I wish you a safe journey."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As she spoke, two tears quietly slipped down Emma's cheeks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander understood what she meant. This was likely the last time they would see each other. They were now two people living in completely different worlds, and their paths would never cross again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A wave of relief washed over Alexander. He didn't want to be the cause of any damage to another person's family.</span></p><div class="pagination">
