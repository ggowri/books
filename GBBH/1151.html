  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Karson wore a sullen expression, his lips sealed tight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To recruit three experts, he had initially offered them each a million dollars, promising a bonus of 30 million dollars for anyone who could take down Stephen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now that the prize had doubled, he didn't expect the trio would still be no match for Stephen. His plan had utterly fallen through.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cesar found himself in a tough spot, unsure of what to do. Nearly 60 years old, he had hoped to use the 30 million dollars he'd earn to start prepping for retirement. Now, that dream felt impossibly distant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The atmosphere in the room turned heavy, broken only by Travis' groans and labored breaths.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, Cesar let out a laugh, turning to Karson. "Mr. Chapman, I'm a man of my word. Now that I'm here, I'll see this through to the end.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But if I don't make it, please look after my family."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Karson nodded gravely. "Don't worry, Mr. Dussel. I'll take care of them."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you, Mr. Chapman," Cesar replied, giving a </span><span>thumbs</span><span>-up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He then glanced at Alexander, a complex expression crossing his face. "Listen, young man, you see the situation we're in. I'll try to hold Stephen off. You and Mr. Chapman need to get as far away as possible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Consider yourself lucky; otherwise, you'd be dead right now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Cesar shrugged off his coat, revealing black tights, appearing more formidable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though he had been irritated with Alexander earlier, he now urged him to flee. A calmness washed over him, and a fierce determination replaced his earlier frustration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cesar's eyes sparkled with resolve. He waved to Karson, shouting, "Go! I'll buy you some time!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Not bad. You've got some skill. You're just as tough as that fat guy," Stephen remarked, surprise flickering across his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Trying to escape? Not a chance!" He lunged toward Karson, but Cesar intercepted him, and the two began a fierce exchange.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The air crackled with tension as their swords clashed, each blow sending shockwaves through the room, accompanied by a flurry of sparks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their attacks created a whirlwind of energy, as each strike carried the force of a sharp blade.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The battle escalated, the ground cracking underfoot and furniture shattering like glass as if an earthquake had struck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alex, we need to go now!" Karson shouted, gripping Alexander's arm and attempting to pull him away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He understood that Cesar couldn't hold Stephen off for long. As soon as Cesar fell, their chances of escape would vanish.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander merely smiled, remaining rooted to the spot despite Karson's frantic urgings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alex! We have to run!" Karson yelled, panic rising as beads of sweat formed on his forehead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wondered if Alexander was frozen in fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Thompson, is this the help you got for me?" Karson complained inwardly, regretting ever believing Leonard's words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're not getting away! Get out of here!" Stephen bellowed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A sharp flash of a sword sliced through the air, followed by a scream.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cesar staggered back, a deep gash across his chest revealing the bone beneath, blood pouring from the wound.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, no!" Karson gasped in terror, stepping back in shock. He hadn't anticipated Cesar's swift defeat, realizing it was too late to escape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander remained composed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm going to kill you!" Cesar charged at Stephen again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Two blades crossed in a fierce arc toward Cesar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fear flickered across his face as he rolled to the side, desperately trying to evade the strike.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite his efforts, Stephen's blade left deep lacerations on Cesar's left arm, nearly severing it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Injured and reeling, Cesar staggered back, his face ashen, collapsing onto the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Karson watched in horror, his eyes wide, feeling his lips dry and throat constrict. Even though he was a fighter himself, he felt utterly powerless against Stephen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cesar pressed a hand to his wound, gasping for breath. The sound was ragged. "I'm getting old. If I were ten years younger, I might have stood a chance."</span></p><div class="pagination">
