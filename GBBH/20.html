  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Ms. Blackburn, could you please turn around? I'll show you after I put them on."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander struggled with the zipper, but he didn't dare to pull too hard, fearing it might break.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The zipper seemed to have a mind of its own, getting stuck more and more.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You're a grown man, yet you can't even put on a pair of pants properly."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava scolded him playfully, stopping him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Don't move. I'll help you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava knelt in front of Alexander, facing his zipper.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Move your hand away. I'll pull it for you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava's voice was gentle, with a slight tremble.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander couldn't help but feel a growing tension in his pants, making it even tighter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava's face flushed as she glanced up at him and then reached out to help.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As her delicate fingers touched the zipper, they inevitably brushed against the bulge in his pants.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Especially since Alexander, from his height, could see the alluring fullness of Ava's chest through her neckline, making his heart race even faster.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava grew more nervous, her face turning red and her hands trembling uncontrollably.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The two of them were getting closer, and the scent from Alexander's body filled Ava's senses.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander couldn't resist any longer. He reached out, touched Ava's cheek, and then slowly traced down her neck, trying to slip his hand inside her shirt. He finally reached under her collar to play with her fullness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her breasts felt wonderful, soft, full, and with a perfect bounce.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Suddenly, a sharp pain made Alexander wince.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava had pinched the flesh on the inside of his thigh hard.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Behave yourself! If you keep this up, I'll castrate you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava warned, her face flushed red.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Maybe I should just do it myself."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander's heart was racing, and his desire was becoming harder to control.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Sit still and stop having those thoughts. I'm almost done."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava made Alexander sit on the dressing bench, kneeling between his legs as she continued to struggle with the zipper.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander was at a loss. It was clear that she was stubborn. He thought, "The prettier women were, the more stubborn.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With a stunning beauty kneeling in front of me, what man could resist the temptation? How could I not react?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Ms. Blackburn, it's not that I can't control myself. It's just that you're too captivating. But I never force a woman to do anything."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander admitted as his pants bulged like a tent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You're so naughty, really annoying!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava's eyes shimmered with a mix of irritation and allure.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Then she gripped Alexander's manhood and gave it a light squeeze, making Alexander feel like he was on cloud nine.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just as Alexander was about to embrace her, a shocked voice interrupted them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Sir, ma'am, this is a fitting room. What... What are you trying to do?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was the saleswoman, covering her mouth in shock, clearly overwhelmed by the scene before her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The young, handsome man sat on the bench with his legs apart, his zipper undone, looking thrilled and content.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The stunning beauty was kneeling between his legs, her eyes filled with desire, holding onto his manhood.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Sir, ma'am, we don't allow this here. Please..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You've misunderstood. My zipper was just stuck."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander quickly explained.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The interruption brought him back to his senses, and his arousal faded instantly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At that moment, Ava finally managed to pull up the zipper with a swift motion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Finally done, that was exhausting!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava exclaimed with relief.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The saleswoman also breathed a sigh of relief, shook her head, and left.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Half an hour later, Alexander walked out of the store with several shopping bags, accompanied by Ava.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This episode had brought them closer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Thank you for the gift."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander couldn't help but wrap his arm around Ava.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava pretended to resist a bit and then intertwined her fingers with his, a sweet smile on her face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Suddenly, Alexander felt a sense of danger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander's eyes sharpened as he turned to look at a certain floor of the skyscraper across the street.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He had sensed the presence of danger, an assassin. It was unclear if the target was him or Ava.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">There was a slight reflection of a sniper's scope!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If Alexander weren't a Warrior with the Force, he would never have noticed the sniper hidden in a building a hundred yards away.</p><div class="pagination">
