  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yvonne and her crew launched their counterattack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With her speed power and witchcraft, Yvonne might not have been as elusive as Alexander, but her movements were fast and dazzling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Within just a few seconds, the remaining dozen or so Mafia members were all taken out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Boom! Boom!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fireballs erupted, and the convoy was soon engulfed in flames.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Arthur's carefully planned ambush had been completely destroyed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander waved his hand with casual elegance. "Let's go," he said, leading the way </span><span>back to the vehicle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, Yvonne's convoy arrived at the docks, where they boarded a luxurious yacht and sped off toward Treasure Island.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Onboard the yacht, in one of the opulent bedrooms, Yvonne was serving Alexander dinner.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The table was laden with a feast&mdash;tender, juicy steaks, freshly baked fish, crisp vegetable salads, and fine red wine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander devoured the meal with relish, then wiped his mouth, giving Yvonne a smile that was both knowing and mysterious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the Lord of the City of Sorcery, Yvonne likely had plans of her own, but Alexander was fully aware of what she was thinking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He first inquired about the current situation in the City of Sorcery, then instructed Yvonne to increase her efforts in stockpiling supplies in preparation for the impending crisis.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yvonne furrowed her brow and, in a low voice, asked, "Master, do you really think that old bastard Yinson will continue with the Apocalypse Project?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander nodded. "He won't give up. He's backed up all the data, and there are even hidden immortality potions."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yvonne's face darkened at the thought of the living dead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even as a witch, the idea still sent a chill through her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander stood and gave his next order. "I'm going to take a bath. Help me scrub my back."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yvonne immediately agreed, rushing into the bathroom to fill the bathtub with water.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Alexander removed his clothes, revealing his well-toned, muscular body, Yvonne's eyes lit up, and a rush of warmth spread through her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The memories of the pleasure and intense sensations when he had pinned her beneath him before flooded her mind, and she found herself longing for more, unable to forget the heady mix of excitement and anticipation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander stepped into the bathtub without a care in the world, the water at the perfect temperature. He let out a contented sigh as he settled in, relaxing into the warmth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yvonne followed, shedding her clothes until only a revealing set of lingerie remained&mdash;lacey, half-cup bra and a thong, clearly prepared for the moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She knelt on the floor, completely focused as she massaged Alexander's back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The way her ample chest moved with each motion was hard to miss, drawing attention as she worked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander savored the moment, his hand reaching out to grasp the large, supple flesh, kneading and teasing it with a playful touch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, her soft, pink peaks stood proudly, and Yvonne let out a soft, enticing moan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander lingered for a moment, then turned to her with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yvonne waited for the command, her heart racing with excitement. Despite feeling a deep yearning, she had held back until now, too shy to move on her own.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Turning her back to Alexander, she pulled at the strings of her thong and, with a steadying hand on him, lowered herself down, taking him in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As her body was filled once again, Yvonne cried out in excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander also took a deep breath. The heat and tightness of Yvonne were beyond anything he'd imagined.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He even wondered if she had some sort of witchcraft, making her feel as tight and untouched as a virgin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In truth, Alexander had been with enough women to know what to expect, but as soon as he entered her, a shiver ran through him, goosebumps spreading across his skin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yvonne turned to face him, her eyes full of allure, and slowly parted her long legs, wrapping them around his waist, pulling him in closer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Master, I feel so good... come on, take me, claim me... make me yours," Yvonne said, her face flushed, her beautiful eyes filled with longing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After that, she didn't have a chance to speak again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander moved like a machine, his hips pounding relentlessly, each thrust a forceful withdrawal followed by another deep plunge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yvonne was speechless, overwhelmed by the sudden, fierce assault. She could only cling to him, wrapping her arms and legs around him, bracing herself for the storm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every time Alexander thrust himself violently, Yvonne would scream without restraint, almost as if her life depended on it, shouting filthy words like "fuck me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander enjoyed it too, crude and vulgar words slipping from his lips as he viciously cursed at her, all while roughly groping her breasts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yvonne eagerly responded to Alexander's teasing, pushing her seductive hips forward with each movement, trying to deepen their connection.</span></p><div class="pagination">
