She pulled Alexander into a passionate kiss.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander savored her lips, greedy as he drew her sweet, pink-tinted lips into his mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosalia's tongue slipped into Alexander's mouth, and their kiss deepened, wild and passionate, like lovers in the throes of desire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her hands wrapped around his neck, emitting soft, breathy moans.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander kept one arm around her waist while his other hand slid up her thigh, exploring freely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He moved downward, his hand slipping under her shorts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosalia wore a thong, and Alexander's hand landed squarely on her soft, round butt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The flight attendants, witnessing the intimate scene, blushed, unable to intervene, silently shaking their heads.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"These young people today are too bold, kissing in public on an airplane."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a long kiss, Rosalia was panting, her eyes half-lidded, her chest heaving with anticipation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing no one else around, Alexander quickly pulled Rosalia toward the plane's bathroom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The bathroom was larger than economy class ones, given they were in first class.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He locked the door behind them, pushing Rosalia up against it, kissing her again as he slipped one of his legs between hers. He lifted her slightly, grinding against her sensitive body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he pushed her T-shirt up, exposing her voluptuous chest, he eagerly began to caress and squeeze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosalia moaned, clearly wanting more; her lips parted as soft, seductive sounds escaped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her hands wandered down, reaching into Alexander's pants, expertly teasing him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ugh!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander exhaled sharply, unable to control himself. It felt too good.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unable to hold back any longer, he pinned Rosalia to the toilet, lifting her round hips as he undid his pants...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was over an hour before Alexander finally stepped out, feeling refreshed and satisfied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Two flight attendants were gossiping nearby, and when they saw Alexander, their faces turned bright red.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They couldn't help but glance at him, amazed at how long it had taken.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Rosalia had her fill, she curled up in Alexander's arms, a content smile on her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Several hours later, they arrived at Lumiria's airport.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They quickly got into a black BMW and sped off toward Aetheris Street.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aetheris Street was strategically located in the heart of the city, right next to the affluent neighborhood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This area was primarily populated by people from Avalora. They were tightly united and fiercely protective of each other, thus carving out their own space in Lumiria.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander admired this unity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Avalora people had never feared enemies from outside. The only thing that would really hurt them were traitors and backstabbers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Over a century ago, the Avalora people were oppressed by the wealthy, their lives miserable and exploited.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But over time, they had banded together, forming their own power, the Obsidian Gang, among them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eventually, the Obsidian Gang grew to dominate Aetheris Street, becoming the largest gang in the area, overshadowing even the Mafia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Mafia typically avoided Aetheris Street, unwilling to provoke the Obsidian Gang.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander had a grudge against the Mafia, but after the "Apocalypse Project" of the Sakra Society was exposed, the Mafia, as a participant, also suffered severe crackdowns by various countries.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thus, the Mafia was severely weakened, their leader nearly lost his life, and they had no capacity to oppose Alexander anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Holding the belief that the enemy of my enemy is my friend, Alexander had a good impression of the Obsidian Gang.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aetheris Street was vibrant and bustling, clearly a place where the Obsidian Gang had invested significant effort.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the past, the first Avalora immigrants to Aetheris Street had been laborers or illegal immigrants, many of them involved in human trafficking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Obsidian Gang also specialized in dealing with corrupt officials who fled with stolen money.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Corrupt officials had a lot of money and were like a cake to them.
