  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander grabbed Clay by the neck, lifting him effortlessly like an eagle snatching a chick.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Speak! How did you hurt Gill just now? If you don't, you're toast!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clay kept quiet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander tightened his grip, and Clay's face started to turn blue as he gasped for air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll count to three. If you don't spill, it's game over for you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"One!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Two!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Alexander counted, his gaze grew colder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clay trembled uncontrollably, knowing Alexander wasn't joking; he could snap his neck in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I... I used dark magic and cast a curse..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gasps filled the room!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Reynolds family was stunned, realizing Clay was indeed the real culprit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Clay! How could you do something so heartless? I seriously misjudged you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luther was furious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He even slapped himself, nearly mistaking this scheming guy for his daughter's husband.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clay's attack on Gill was beyond vicious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luther and Nancy were seething, but Richard was even more enraged and felt utterly ashamed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Clay, you deserve to die! You really do!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The old man shouted angrily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander held Clay up, still gripping his neck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Please don't kill me... I... I was wrong. I'll leave Kingsdon right away..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clay flailed helplessly, struggling in vain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was gasping for air, like a fish out of water, growing weaker by the second, his face darkening from lack of oxygen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sigh..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Richard sighed deeply and cautiously addressed Alexander, "You can't kill him here; otherwise, the City of Sorcery will hold a grudge against us. He's not just Rock Rossetti's apprentice, but also his illegitimate son. If he dies, Juan won't let it go."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander shot him a cold glance and scoffed, "Are you saying the Kaylon is afraid of the </span><span>City</span><span>? Being bullied like this and still acting so weak&mdash;clearly, you're getting old."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Richard's face flushed with embarrassment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Right, right, I'm getting senile. I don't want the Kaylon to make a powerful enemy!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander remained unfazed, tightening his grip further.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ugh!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Poor Clay's eyes bulged; he was on the brink of passing out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Richard could only fret, unsure of what to do.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luther quickly said to Nancy, "Nancy, your engagement to Clay is definitely off, but starting a feud with the City of Sorcery isn't necessary."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a moment of contemplation, Nancy finally spoke, "Fine, let him go, but he must leave Kingsdon for good and never bother me again."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander grinned, "What's this? Feeling sorry for him?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What? What nonsense are you talking about?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy tugged at Alexander's arm in frustration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then she leaned close to his ear, blushing as she whispered, "If it helps, I'll serve you with Rosalia tonight. Whatever you want to try, I'm game."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander licked his lips, feeling a bit tighter in his pants.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy was undeniably an enticing woman; even if she wasn't as accommodating as Rosalia, she was more than enough to leave any man wanting more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If she was all in... Alexander felt a stir of interest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thud!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander slammed Clay down to the ground like tossing out trash.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Huff! Huff!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clay lay on the ground, gasping for air, still shaken.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moments ago, he thought he was about to die, his vision fading and even losing the ability to feel pain. He never expected to still be alive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hahaha!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once he caught his breath, Clay suddenly erupted into manic laughter, a smug smirk on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You all are still afraid of the City of Sorcery! Just wait and see, this isn't over. I won't let you off the hook."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clay felt emboldened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Alexander could move, Nancy delivered a powerful kick to Clay's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The heel of her high-heeled shoe dug into his flesh, causing blood to gush as he howled in pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bitch, you dare to mess with my looks?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In response, Nancy pulled out a gun and fired two shots.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A piercing scream echoed as Clay's knees were punctured, rendering his legs useless.</span></p><div class="pagination">
