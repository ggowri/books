  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Early the next morning, Alexander was still in bed when he received a message from Augusta.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>[Sir, Norma Walsh, the leader of the Dragon Gang, sent an invitation. She wants you to visit Risun to discuss an alliance against the Sakra Society.]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander was surprised.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Dragon Gang had suffered several defeats at his hands, including losing Demon Island to him. The animosity was deep. Yet, Norma was now extending an olive branch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>An hour later, Alexander convened a meeting at the Ultimate Alliance headquarters.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seated in his executive chair, he reviewed detailed files on the Dragon Gang.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Scrap metal recycling, film and entertainment, hotels, dining, arms dealing, the Dragon Gang's business empire was vast.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Their most influential and profitable sector, however, was their control of the adult film industry. Over half of such content globally was filmed in Risun, with the Dragon Gang pulling the strings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This alone brought them hundreds-of-billions dollars in annual revenue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Combined with their other ventures like scrap metal and arms trading, their assets were in the trillions, making them a worthy adversary to the Sakra Society.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander glanced up from the file and asked with a calm demeanor, "What do you think? Should I go?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Augusta was the first to oppose the idea.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Sir, I don't think you should. This must be a trap. If you go, you'll be walking into danger."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander raised an eyebrow. "What's Norma's relationship like with the Walsh family?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Augusta thought for a moment before answering, "Not good. The family patriarch, Sean Walsh, is a ruthless control freak. He's never been happy about Norma becoming the leader of the Dragon Gang."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander chuckled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If there's internal conflict, that's our leverage. If we can align with Norma, it would be a significant advantage for us."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Betty frowned. "Sir, that's their territory. It's too risky to go there."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Augusta's eyes were filled with worry, and a dozen other high-ranking members of the Ultimate Alliance looked anxiously at Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I think it's worth going!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander said confidently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Augusta, reply to Norma. Tell her I'm heading to Risun immediately and expect her to ensure my safety.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Betty, arrange the flight."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Yes, Sir!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Since Alexander had made the decision, Augusta and Betty dared not oppose it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Once settled, Alexander turned to another matter. "Have you found anything from the investigation?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Betty quickly handed him a report.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Sir, the number of missing person cases in Loscity has spiked again. It's five times higher than the same period last year. Something is definitely off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The police haven't found any leads, and even Meilin's contacts came up empty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"It's as if the victims vanished into thin air, leaving only bloodstains and slaughtered livestock behind."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander's expression darkened. He gave a firm order.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Increase manpower. Find out what's happening!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"No matter how things go with Norma, I'll be back in Loscity in a week.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Augusta, you're in charge of security while I'm gone. Nothing must go wrong."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Yes, Sir!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Augusta and Betty responded immediately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In Azuran, the bustling streets of Azuran Island...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Damn it! I'm late again! Am I destined to be a pitiful worker for life?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A man in his thirties was jogging hurriedly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He gritted his teeth, looking very unhappy. He wasn't young anymore and had achieved nothing, not even a girlfriend.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At his age, he had achieved nothing significant. He had no girlfriend, and even his parents regarded him as a disappointment, treating him far worse than his successful, married brother.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If there was one thing Keith excelled at, it was watching porn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He'd seen thousands of them, memorized the male leads' moves, and even thought he could outperform them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Keith contemplated whether he should apply to be an actor in the industry himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As he mulled over his bleak prospects, a car sped past, narrowly missing him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Startled, Keith adjusted his cheap tie and glanced wistfully at the towering skyscraper beside him, envy written all over his face.</span></p><div class="pagination">
