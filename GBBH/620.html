  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the prized ore auctioned for thirty million was about to be cut open, the excitement in the room was palpable. People crowded around in layers, eager to witness what treasures might lie inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even the stone-cutting technician was tingling with anticipation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Whitlock, where should we begin?" he asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let me see," Morton replied, circling the stone with an air of authority.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He tapped here and there, then marked a spot with a pen and confidently instructed, "Start cutting from here. Be careful not to damage the gems inside, or you'll answer to me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nodding vigorously, the technician relayed Morton's instructions to his team. They lifted the stone-cutting saw and aligned it carefully with the marked line.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A piercing whir filled the hall, the only sound as everyone held their breath, eyes glued to the stone, desperate not to miss the moment top-grade gems might emerge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the cutting noise intensified, the tension in the air did, too.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one blinked; pulses quickened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Alexander merely shook his head with a knowing smile. His All-seeing Eyes had shown him the truth&mdash;this stone was no more than a dud.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The shrill sound continued, grating on everyone's nerves, while Morton grew more anxious by the second.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This stone had cost him everything&mdash;thirty million dollars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a loud crack, a quarter of the stone fell away, revealing a cross-section to the waiting crowd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alas, the exposed surface showed nothing more than specks of white&mdash;perhaps enough for a few mediocre gemstones at best.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn, it's over!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is there really nothing in there?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd buzzed with disappointment or schadenfreude.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Many found pleasure in the spectacle of wealth meeting misfortune, far more </span><span>satisfying than making money themselves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Morton's face drained of color as he shouted, "Impossible!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Quiet, everyone! We've barely scratched the surface. Keep cutting!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd hushed again, reminded that the nearly 6-foot-tall stone was only a quarter revealed. Conclusions would have to wait.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Whitlock truly has nerves of steel. His composure is a lesson for us all," someone remarked, watching the technician as he prepared to make another cut.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The abrasive whirring resumed as the staff cut the stone in half again, but the result was the same&mdash;no sign of top-grade gems.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's doomed! It's all over. We've cut so much already, and still no gems!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Unbelievable. Who would've thought this pricey stone would turn out to be junk?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thirty million dollars, and all he </span><span>get</span><span> are a few minor gems worth maybe hundreds of thousands dollars."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Whitlock really misjudged this time&mdash;thirty million dollars down the drain!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The room buzzed with speculation and barely concealed glee at Morton's plight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Morton, his face gloomy with anger, trembled uncontrollably.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The technician asked sympathetically, "Mr. Whitlock, should we continue?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Keep cutting! Leave nothing untouched. I want it all opened," Morton insisted, clinging to the faint hope of salvaging a top-grade gem from within the massive rock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sandy, meanwhile, felt dizzy with the realization of her role in Morton's potential financial ruin. Thirty million wasn't chump change&mdash;it wasn't thirty thousand dollars, but thirty million dollars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If this gamble proved wholly misguided, Morton would surely hold her accountable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ha! That's what you call poetic justice!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander laughed heartily, his eyes seeming to see straight through to Morton's very soul.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Olivia looked at Alexander with admiration&mdash;his insight was truly impressive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The persistent sound of slicing stone filled the room as the large rock turned into smaller pieces and smaller pieces into mere fragments.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Cut it! Keep cutting!" Morton shouted frantically, nearly beside himself with desperation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In no time, the massive ore had been reduced to tiny rubble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eventually, even these small fragments were crushed with hammers, revealing not a single top-grade gem or even a decent gemstone inside.</span></p><div class="pagination">
