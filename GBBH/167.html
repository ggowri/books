  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the car, Alexander found himself toying with Mary's soft boobs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, a thought struck Mary. "Am I losing my mind? Just because I'm grateful to Alexander doesn't mean I should throw myself at him like this."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The memory of how she had flirted with him earlier made her feel utterly embarrassed. She had tried things with him that she never even attempted with her late husband.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ouch, you're hurting me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mary playfully swatted Alexander's hand away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Alexander, still captivated by her luscious figure, couldn't resist reaching out again, his hand covering her softness. It felt so inviting and plush.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop it! You're such a tease! I can't take it anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're too much for me, seriously. Next time..." Mary trailed off, her words echoing Betty's sentiments from earlier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander felt a swell of pride and satisfaction at her response.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, </span><span>Houtte</span><span> plans to make a move against me at the gem auction?" he asked, shifting the conversation back to business.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mary's demeanor changed instantly, turning serious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes! You need to watch your back. He thinks I'm genuinely teaming up with him. Ha! I'm not nearly as stupid or greedy as he thinks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Blood Gang is already making a killing as distributors of magic powder. </span><span>Your</span><span> and the Saint Group? Can't be trifled with. </span><span>Houtte</span><span> is blinded by greed."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander couldn't help but admire her sharpness. Most men didn't even possess such keen insight and discernment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If he wants the formula for the magic powder, I'll make sure he regrets it," he replied dismissively.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They lingered in each other's company for a while longer before Mary finally drove him home.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>David's car trailed them from a distance, following until they reached Alexander's Beverly Hills residence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Alexander stepped out of his Bentley, David recognized him and froze for a moment, stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, Mary jumped out of the car, her cheeks flushed and her eyes sparkling with a hint of mischief&mdash;clearly, she had just enjoyed a little excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without hesitation, Mary threw herself into Alexander's arms, kissing him deeply.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>David pounded his fist against the seat in frustration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it! It's Alexander! Isn't he with Ava? What the hell does he have that makes him so irresistible to women?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The driver shot him a knowing glance, muttering under his breath, "Maybe because that guy knows how to go at it for hours, like a horse."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once Mary pulled away, David signaled the driver to catch up with her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He felt humiliated and was determined to confront Mary about what he had just witnessed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At a fork in the road, David's car cut off Mary, and he stormed out, fuming.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get out of the car!" he shouted, banging on her window.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mary's heart raced when she saw it was David. "What's he doing here?" she thought, panic rising.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>David shouted through the glass, "You little tramp! I can't believe you're getting it on with Alexander in broad daylight!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've been chasing you for over a year, and you keep turning me down. What does he have that I don't? He's Ava's boyfriend&mdash;there's no future with him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>David was practically frothing at the mouth, gesturing wildly as he ranted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mary was shocked and angry, not expecting him to catch her like this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Taking a deep breath, she forced herself to calm down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When David finally paused to catch his breath, she rolled down the window, her beautiful face a mask of cold indifference.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"David, I'm single now. I can choose whoever I want. And Alexander is just Ava's boyfriend; they're not married.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So what? </span><span>So</span><span> what if he gets married someday? I enjoy being with him, and you have no right to tell me who I can be with."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Mary slammed the car into gear and sped off, leaving David fuming in her rearview mirror.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bitch! Slut! Just you wait! Sooner or later, I'll make you beg at my feet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And Alexander, you think you can steal my woman? You're </span><span>gonna</span><span> pay for this," David snarled, his teeth clenched in fury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a long, tense silence, the driver finally dared to speak up, his voice barely above a whisper.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"David, it's getting late. You've got a meeting at </span><span>Carifona</span><span> soon. Shouldn't we be heading out?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>David grunted, saying, "Get Mark on the line. I want the boss of the Fraternity here. Now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Right away, sir!" the driver hurriedly agreed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander's </span><span>gonna</span><span> be in for a world of pain", he thought.</span></p><div class="pagination">
