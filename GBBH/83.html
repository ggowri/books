  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander instructed Augusta and the others to rest for a few days while they awaited further orders.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, Charlize, sporting only a minor injury, was reluctant to stay cooped up in the house. She persistently pleaded with Alexander to take her along.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He took a moment to size her up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Charlize had changed into a snug black leather outfit that hugged her curves perfectly. Her chestnut hair was braided, framing her striking features. Years of training had sculpted her body into a fit and alluring figure with no excess fat in sight&mdash;except for her ample chest and shapely backside.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The leather accentuated her sexy silhouette, exuding both charm and fierce confidence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Before Alexander could decline, Augusta chimed in seriously, "Boss, having Charlize with you would put our minds at ease."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander smiled slightly, aware of their faith in his medical skills, but they were still oblivious to the extent of his combat prowess.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After a moment's hesitation, he agreed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With William secretly watching over his daughter and Betty keeping an eye on Billy while managing finances, there weren't many options left.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Charlize beamed as she followed Alexander out, turning back to her companions to stick her tongue out playfully.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Augusta couldn't help but chuckle. "Charlize has always had a thing for refined men. With a boss like ours, I wouldn't be surprised if she tries to cozy up to him."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Logan laughed along. "Right? If Charlize starts shaking that fine behind of hers, I'd worry about our boss keeping his cool!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Marvin felt a twinge of frustration. Everyone knew he had a crush on Charlize, but she had never given him the time of day.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Yet, realizing that the man in question was his boss and benefactor, he quickly let it go.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When Alexander and Charlize arrived back at the villa, she exclaimed, "Wow, boss, you live in a place like this? You really are something else!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Before Alexander could respond, Charlize's expression shifted dramatically.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She quickly stepped in front of him, shielding him with her body.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Suddenly, a group of burly men surged from the shadows, surrounding them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">One of them barked, their arrogance palpable, "Alexander, you're coming with us to the hospital to lift the curse on Mr. Tate. If you refuse, I swear I'll make you regret it!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Boss, don't worry! I'll take care of these guys," Charlize said, her fists clenched in excitement.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She had been cooped up in that rundown junkyard for too long and was itching for a fight.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Alright, let's see what you've got," Alexander replied with a grin.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">There were five of them, and it was the perfect opportunity to gauge Charlize's skills.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Listen up! You either get lost right now or surrender!" Charlize sneered, charging at the leader like a lioness on the hunt.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She landed a solid punch right on his nose.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The man let out a yelp, blood and snot mixing as he staggered back, howling, "You little bitch! You hit me? You're asking for it!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Without missing a beat, Charlize followed up with another punch, this time to his gut.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He doubled over, crashing to the ground.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The sounds of pain and panic filled the air as the others, lacking any real fighting experience, fell one by one to Charlize's relentless assault.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Seriously? You think you can bully my boss with moves like that?" Charlize scoffed, looking down at the defeated men.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A cold voice cut through the chaos.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Alexander, do you really enjoy hiding behind a woman? If you're a man, step up and handle this like one!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Charlize turned to see Sebastian approaching, flanked by a group of henchmen. They loomed like a storm cloud, their presence heavy and threatening.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This time, Sebastian had clearly come prepared. More than a dozen of his men surrounded them, all looking tough and armed with clubs.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A few among them were clearly seasoned fighters, ready for a showdown.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">One of the men, with short brown hair and a shaved head, pointed at Alexander. "Mr. Sebastian Tate, it's him! He's Alexander!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Sebastian's gaze fixed on Alexander, burning with a fiery intensity.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Alexander, you used witchcraft to cripple my son's hands? Do you want to die?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander sized up Sebastian, Guzman's most trusted cousin, who was bound to know Guzman's exact whereabouts and felt a surge of excitement.</p><div class="pagination">
