  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Logan was about to charge forward and curse him out, but Alexander quickly held him back. His instincts screamed a warning&mdash;this man was extremely dangerous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The middle-aged man sneered at them.&nbsp;"Even stray dogs and nobodies dare come here to ask for medicine?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, without sparing them another glance, he casually knocked on the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's face darkened, his fists clenching tightly. He had thought that reaching the level-four warrior rank, combined with his&nbsp;mysterious golden energy, golden body, and energy waves, meant he could challenge even&nbsp;half-step level-five warriors. Because of that, he had let his guard down, neglecting further progress.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now that he was being humiliated, he had no one to blame but himself!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A moment later, the same young priest from earlier opened the door. Upon seeing the man, he&nbsp;immediately&nbsp;swung the gates wide open.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man glanced around, catching the shocked expressions of the onlookers. A trace of arrogance flickered in his eyes. He lightly&nbsp;flicked open his folding fan, then turned and&nbsp;stepped into Hall of Lives, the doors shutting behind him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The people who had come with him immediately started bragging.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Jaryl is a genius disciple of the Inner Court&mdash;ranked 86th on the Demon-Slaying List!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"An Inner Court disciple?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I never thought I'd see an Inner Court disciple in person! They say there are only about ten thousand of them, and each one is a genius among geniuses!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Every single Inner Court disciple is trained to vanquish demons and subdue evil..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd&nbsp;erupted into excited chatter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"An&nbsp;Inner Court disciple, huh?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's fury burned as he narrowed his eyes, a sharp glint flashing in them.&nbsp;"One day, I'll crush you beneath my feet and repay this humiliation!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two of them lingered outside the hall for a while, but it felt meaningless, so they decided to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, a group of people approached from the distance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leading them was a&nbsp;middle-aged saint, her&nbsp;flowing white robes&nbsp;billowing gently in the breeze. Her&nbsp;long eyebrows arched toward her temples, her ears hung low past her shoulders, and her phoenix eyes radiated wisdom. Her face was&nbsp;serene and kind, exuding a divine presence. In her hand, she carried a&nbsp;jade purification bottle, adorned with a&nbsp;willow branch, looking utterly sacred and dignified.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The onlookers&nbsp;bowed respectfully, their voices ringing in unison.&nbsp;"Greetings, Father Elias!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was none other than Elias, the head of the&nbsp;Dominion Church's Great Vehicle Division&nbsp;and the&nbsp;abbess of Hall of Lives.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander and Logan&nbsp;quickly bowed in respect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elias was about to pass Alexander and enter the hall when, suddenly, his&nbsp;golden energy&nbsp;in his left chest&nbsp;stirred ever so slightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The master&nbsp;halted abruptly&nbsp;and turned to face Alexander. He felt as if those&nbsp;phoenix-like eyes had pierced through his very soul, seeing his past and present with absolute clarity. His heartbeat quickened, a strange sense of unease creeping over him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elias's lips curved into a faint smile. She lightly&nbsp;gestured toward Alexander and Logan, saying with a gentle voice, "You two, come with me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander and Logan exchanged uneasy glances before following Father Elias into the hall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd outside&nbsp;erupted in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Father Elias never bothers with trivial medicine requests. Who the hell are those two?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Could they be related to her?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That guy looks familiar... Oh! Now I remember! He fought Rhodes in the Silver Division match this year! Damn, I lost thousands of coins betting on that fight!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elias said nothing, simply leading the two into a meditation chamber.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The meditation chamber had an&nbsp;elegant and ancient charm. At its center stood a&nbsp;towering statue of God, over&nbsp;thirty feet tall. The deity was&nbsp;draped in flowing white robes, standing gracefully atop a&nbsp;nine-tiered lotus platform. A&nbsp;jeweled crownadorned the head, and the&nbsp;crescent-shaped eyebrows&nbsp;framed a&nbsp;gentle yet compassionate gaze, radiating both&nbsp;dignity and serenity. In one hand, God held a&nbsp;jade purification bottle with a willow branch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The true God, immeasurably wise, cultivated through countless lifetimes of purity and devotion."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elias&nbsp;walked straight to the meditation cushions&nbsp;in front of the statue, gracefully sitting in the&nbsp;lotus position. She pressed her palms together in a&nbsp;prayer gesture, gazing at Alexander and Logan with a gentle smile. Several young priests stood silently beside her, their heads bowed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander bowed deeply. "Greetings, Father Elias. I have come to Hall of Lives today in search of a rare medicine."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elias's eyes gleamed with a knowing smile as she spoke slowly,&nbsp;"You were born of this land, destined to protect and guide the lost. A single flower contains a world&mdash;when the time is right, all will fall into place."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander and Logan exchanged glances,&nbsp;completely lost. Neither had a clue what she meant. Just as Alexander was about to ask...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elias suddenly&nbsp;gave a firm instruction&nbsp;to one of the priests.&nbsp;"Liora, bring me the small vial."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The young priest named&nbsp;Liora&nbsp;looked up, visibly startled, as if about to say something but held back. He lowered his gaze, then walked over to a&nbsp;golden nanmu wood cabinet, carefully retrieving a&nbsp;small jade bottle. Holding it with&nbsp;both hands, he respectfully presented it to Elias.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elias gracefully&nbsp;lifted the willow branch&nbsp;from her&nbsp;jade purification bottle, allowing a few drops of&nbsp;milky-white liquid&nbsp;to fall into the&nbsp;small jade vial.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A&nbsp;strange and enchanting fragrance&nbsp;filled the room. The moment Alexander caught a whiff, he felt his&nbsp;mind clear and his vision sharpen. It was as if his&nbsp;muscles, bones, and every fiber of his being were inhaling the scent, absorbing an&nbsp;overwhelming surge of strength. Just that one breath&nbsp;felt equivalent to three full days of intense training!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander knew without a doubt&mdash;this was&nbsp;one of the most precious treasures of Hall of Lives. Overcome with gratitude, he carefully&nbsp;took the jade bottle from Liora's hands&nbsp;and placed it into his&nbsp;Dimensional pouch. Then, pulling Logan down beside him, he&nbsp;knelt and bowed deeply several times.</span></p><div class="pagination">
