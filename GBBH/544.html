  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the sight of Ophelia, </span><span>Hoson</span><span> felt inexplicably excited and swallowed hard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Alexander just glanced at her, and his indifferent expression made </span><span>Hoson's</span><span> heart sink to the bottom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How demanding was he?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander waved his hand. "Not to mention an online celebrity, even if you invite a Hollywood star, I'm not interested now. Go back."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hoson</span><span> was stunned. Even Hollywood stars couldn't attract Alexander!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia felt displeased and mocked, "Will a Hollywood star like you? Stop pretending."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was not angry but calm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, </span><span>Hoson</span><span> flew into a rage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He slapped Ophelia hard in the face with his backhand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She covered her burning cheek in a daze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm sorry. The damn woman is ignorant. Please forgive me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hoson</span><span> apologized sincerely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brittany couldn't stand it anymore and growled, "</span><span>Hoson</span><span>, are you crazy? Who told you to bring these bitches here? Drive them away right now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay. I'll drive them away right now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a panic, </span><span>Hoson</span><span> trembled and quickly coaxed those women out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Remember, if you do something stupid like this again, I'll ask my grandfather to shoot you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brittany's threat made </span><span>Hoson's</span><span> face turn pale, and he kept his mouth shut, not daring to say a word.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you remember it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, I do. I remember it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Faced with the furious Brittany, </span><span>Hoson</span><span> nodded his head repeatedly and then fled away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander ordered Rosalia, "Since Johnathan has betrayed us and is colluding with the Morris family, there is no need to show mercy. Go to the Lauren Villa."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had sentenced the Lauren family to death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, Master!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosalia lowered her head respectfully, hesitant to speak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smiled slightly, naturally knowing what Rosalia was expecting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, with Brittany around, he couldn't say much. He would compensate Rosalia after she came back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Late at night, a huge explosion occurred in Johnathan's mansion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dozens of family members, along with more than 20 bodyguards, were all killed in the fire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Other influential figures who had betrayed the Brilliant Group suffered various accidents in a short period of time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Some died in car crashes, some drowned in the bathtubs, and some were electrocuted. The causes of death were all very strange.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their territory was soon under the control of </span><span>Hoson</span><span>, as if it had been prepared long before.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The series of changes caused a stir among </span><span>Kingsdon's</span><span> gangs. Various speculations were made, but no one could find out who was behind it.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The happiest person was </span><span>Hoson</span><span>. After he took over the territories and manpower of several influential figures, his strength expanded rapidly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the past, he had been only one of the stronger gangsters in </span><span>Kingsdon</span><span>, but now, he had firmly established himself as one of the top gangsters.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could even compete with the Mafia's branch in </span><span>Kingsdon</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hoson</span><span> was in awe of Alexander, believing that he was incredibly amazing and formidable!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He finally understood why Alexander was so confident in destroying the Morris family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, he organized his men according to Alexander's orders and prepared to launch an attack on the Morris family's forces in </span><span>Kingsdon</span><span> at any time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hasn't Nancy sent the Kaylon Pill yet?" Alexander muttered to himself while taking care of Ashley.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brittany chuckled, "Don't worry. Nancy will definitely send the Kaylon Pill over. She also mentioned that if you couldn't fulfill your promise and help her get rid of the marriage, she would castrate you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smiled bitterly, "Do I look like someone who doesn't keep his word?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Nancy's promise, he was no longer in a hurry to take revenge on Felix. His top priority now was to rescue and treat Ashley.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, a hotel waiter called.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne, there is a lady named Nancy who wants to see you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander immediately beamed with joy and said to Brittany, "Stay with Ashley. I'm going to meet Nancy."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brittany agreed unhappily, feeling jealous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy was youthful and beautiful in a white belly-baring T-shirt and light blue denim hot pants.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She sat in a high chair, which made her waist appear even slimmer, her buttocks more plump and fuller, and her long white legs particularly eye-catching.</span></p><div class="pagination">
