  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man was just a researcher and didn't notice Alexander silently trailing behind him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander followed him through a maze of corridors, quickly arriving at a heavily guarded room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once he stepped inside, Alexander paused at the corner and used his X-ray vision to look inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Several people were bound to pillars, their limbs restrained tightly with ropes, completely immobile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But what caught his attention most was that none of them were Hazel. Instead, the woman tied to the pillar in the center was Melin!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melin's hair was a wild mess, her appearance completely disheveled as she hung there, vulnerable, like a helpless animal waiting to be slaughtered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yannick, you piece of trash!" Melin yelled, her voice filled with fury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How could you use living people as test subjects? What kind of monsters are you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yannick looked at her without a flicker of emotion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Melin, don't blame me. You were the one who was so persistent with your investigation at the </span><span>Locity</span><span> Police Department. In the end, you were caught by Jake, weren't you?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If it weren't for the fact we had some history back in college, I wouldn't have let Jake bring you here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you refuse to join us, you'll end up just like them, material for our experiments."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melin's face twisted with fury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You scumbag! I'd rather die than join you! You're all heartless, soulless bastards, and you all deserve to rot!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her words only seemed to infuriate Yannick more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His anger flared, and he grabbed her hair with both hands, yanking her head back harshly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You think I'll let you go? After all this attitude? You're going to regret this. If you don't want to die tonight, you'd better surrender, because I'm not letting you off the hook.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've been wanting you for a long time. I'm going to take you like I did before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You called me scum? Let me show you what a real monster looks like.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm not just going to fuck you. I'll do it in front of everyone, and I'll bring a few more men to join in!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He grinned as his hand reached toward her chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"These big tits, huh? Bet they've been groped by men every day, haven't they?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melin's face drained of color. She was completely helpless, her body tied up tight, unable to fight back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yannick, you piece of shit! If you've got any guts, come after us!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You coward! Picking on our captain? I'll put a bullet between your eyes!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The other officers, all fiercely loyal to Melin, shouted angrily, struggling violently against their restraints.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But they were tightly bound, unable to break free.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melin closed her eyes, accepting what she thought was her inevitable fate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, a flash of Alexander's face appeared in her mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought, "I'll never see you again. I won't make it out of this."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her smile was hollow and bitter. She had already accepted that she wouldn't make it out of here alive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Melin had made up her mind. She'd bite down on her tongue and end it herself before she let Yannick have his way. There was no way she'd let him win.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't dare believe Alexander would show up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was too much to hope for. In the real world, miracles didn't happen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yannick, irritated by the police uniform Melin was wearing, started tearing at it with force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the fabric was tough, and despite his efforts, it wouldn't rip.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a moment of defiance, Melin spat in his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yannick, furious, wiped the spit off his cheek, and with a savage snarl, raised his hand to slap Melin across the face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A cold, steely voice cut through the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Touch her, and I'll kill you right here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The entire room fell silent. Yannick froze, his body going rigid.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He quickly spun around, his eyes locking onto Alexander, who had suddenly appeared behind him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah! Alexander! How did you get here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melin's heart skipped a beat. She couldn't believe her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne!" The four officers, just as shocked, let out a collective gasp.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Yannick's face drained of color as he stared at Alexander with growing terror.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Help me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melin, unable to control herself, screamed out in pure relief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man she had given up on seeing again had appeared, just when she needed him most, like an angel sent to save her.</span></p><div class="pagination">
