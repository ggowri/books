He never expected that Leo, known as the underground boxing king of </span><span>Tijuanea</span><span>, would be knocked out in one move by Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Owen, realizing that they were at a disadvantage, took the pain and struggled to escape outside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, before taking a step, he felt a sharp pain in his right leg and was kicked down by Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcos took the opportunity to flee.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You can't get away."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander grabbed Marcos by the wrist and threw him over his shoulder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was a thud.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcos fell heavily to the floor, in so much pain that he couldn't get up for a long time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Weren't you very arrogant just now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander lifted Marcos and slapped him in the face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crisp sound echoed in the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I hate bastards who drug women."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander slapped him again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Isn't your father a gangster boss? He's not even as formidable as Guzman. How dare you provoke me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander scolded Marcos while slapping him hard in the face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In my eyes, you are like an ant on the ground. I can crush you to death with one foot!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After being slapped more than a dozen times, Marcos was in a daze. His face was as swollen as a </span><span>pig's</span><span>, and the blood kept gushing from his mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, kill me today if you have the guts. Otherwise, I will definitely take revenge. My dad will definitely eliminate you and your entire family!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcos was still tough.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, stop fighting. Let's leave </span><span>Tijuanea</span><span> right now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Madelyn worried that someone might get killed and that Caleb would make things difficult for them, quickly dragged Alexander out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcos grinned with a fierce expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey, are you scared now?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill me if you dare. Otherwise, I will be your nightmare. I will return the humiliation I suffered today to you tenfold or a hundredfold!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Madelyn shook in a panic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hurry up! Let's get out of </span><span>Tijuanea</span><span>."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They could afford to offend Owen but not Caleb, an influential drug lord in </span><span>Tijuanea</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander didn't take Madelyn's advice. Instead, he picked up the wine glass, approached Marcos, and smiled, "I can kill you anytime, but I want you to live a hellish life and lose your reputation."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although his tone was calm, his cold and terrifying aura caused the atmosphere to be tense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcos immediately grew nervous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What do you want to do? Kill me if you have the guts. Don't play dirty tricks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My dad is Caleb Brooks. Your dirty tricks will only lead to your miserable doom."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcos' threat obviously proved that he was really afraid.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander sneered, "Drink it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fuck you, I won't drink it. Kill me if you can," Marcos roared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander held him by the head and forced him to take several large gulps of wine from his glass.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcos subconsciously swallowed the wine that dissolved the drugs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, Alexander did the same thing to Owen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Madelyn was dumbfounded. Dozens of aphrodisiacs were added to the glass, and it was potent.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Marcos and Owen didn't have sex with women, the consequences would be serious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The empty wine glass smashed to the floor with a bang.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's go."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander took Madelyn's hand and walked outside calmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She asked worriedly, "A-Are they going to </span><span>be</span><span> okay?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, she was the cause. If Alexander got into trouble for saving her, she would feel guilty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He closed the door with his backhand and used the Force to destroy the key cylinder and lock the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Marcos gasped heavily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He scratched his body crazily and roared like a wild animal, "I am hot and uncomfortable!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Owen had only drunk a small portion of the wine, so his reaction was slower than Marcos'.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Marcos. Marcos, what do you want to do? Don't come over. Don't come over!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before he finished speaking, Marcos pressed him down eagerly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcos, stimulated by the effects of the drugs, had gone mad. No matter how Owen resisted, it was useless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The drugs soon took effect on Owen. He was so excited that even his eyes turned bloodshot.</span></p><div class="pagination">
