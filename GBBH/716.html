  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The doctors, nurses, and police were all fully equipped with protective gear - goggles, masks, isolation gowns, gloves, and shoe covers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite their complete protective equipment, everyone was pale-faced with pounding hearts, wondering if they'd be the next to get infected.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melin barked orders to her subordinate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Summarize the situation and report to the chief immediately! We need more personnel to prevent riots. And remember that! Protect yourself at all costs. Don't get infected!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When no response came from the young officer, she realized he was frozen in fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melin shot him a fierce glare. "What are you standing there for? Get moving!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh! Yes, yes, Ms. Ward, I'll report to the chief right away."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Snapping out of his daze, the young officer suddenly grabbed Melin's arm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Ward, it's dangerous out here. Please be careful..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Behind her protective mask, Melin's expression was hidden, but her eyes crinkled with a hint of amusement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing his worried look, she sighed internally, patted his shoulder, and said softly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kid, I've got a boyfriend. Just take care of yourself."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The young officer's face fell, leaving him at a loss for words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Help! Murder! Somebody </span><span>help</span><span>!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, piercing screams erupted from the other side of the ward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melin's expression hardened as she snapped, "Stop wasting time! Report to the chief and get </span><span>backup</span><span> here now. I'll check it out."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without another word, she drew her gun and rushed toward the screams with the other officers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With trembling hands, the young officer began to make the call...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next day at </span><span>Loscity</span><span> Airport...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Most flights had been grounded due to the terrifying epidemic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Countless people crowded the terminal, desperate to escape the city and the deadly plague.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A private jet touched down on the runway, and after coming to a stop, Alexander was the first to disembark.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosalia and Charlize followed close behind him. Shadow, Augusta, and William had stayed behind at Treasure Island to assist Cloe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander frowned deeply at the sight of the packed terminal. Men, women, the elderly, and children all crammed together in a chaotic mess.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't believe how much </span><span>Loscity</span><span> had changed in just a few short days.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the three of them barely made it out of the airport, Alexander's eyes landed on someone he'd rather not see.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Jane!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There she was, dragging a large suitcase, looking completely worn out. Next to her sat Belinda, sickly and miserable, with an expression of utter despair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Some sketchy-looking skinny guy in an airport uniform was trying to chat Jane up, wearing a smug expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander let out a cold internal laugh, barely sparing them a glance before dismissing them entirely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane had cut all ties with him. If it weren't for Ashley's sake, the Fairfax family would've been wiped out long ago.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Charlize whispered, "Jane's definitely trying to find connections to leave </span><span>Loscity</span><span>. Looks like she's about to get scammed. What an idiot."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just ignore them. Let's go," Alexander said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander strode forward with purpose.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, wait!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they passed by, Jane spotted Alexander immediately and rushed over with excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander stopped in his </span><span>tracks,</span><span> his face expressionless. "What do you want?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I... I need to ask for your help... Could you help us leave </span><span>Loscity</span><span>? Please, for Ashley's sake, help us escape this terrible epidemic!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane stammered her desperate plea.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander heaved a deep sigh, remaining silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This woman is heartless," he thought, "worried only for her own skin and not even considering Ashley."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who the hell are you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The skinny man glared at Alexander with hostility.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He'd been sweet-talking Jane, using his airport job as bait to have some fun with her, but this guy had come out of nowhere to steal his thunder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane replied with a complicated expression, "He's my ex."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her eyes drifted to the two stunning women by Alexander's side, both dripping in luxury and designer brands. Her heart twisted with jealousy and envy, mixed with deep regret.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If she hadn't cheated back then, if she hadn't abandoned Alexander, she would've been the one enjoying his wealth now.</span></p><div class="pagination">
