  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Guzman drew a dagger and cut Cloe's wrist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Crimson blood flowed out, dripping onto the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Something eerie happened. The blood was absorbed as if by a sponge, leaving no trace on the floor but forming a line of blood that converged into the skull of the scepter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The initially pale skull emitted a strange red glow. Everyone watched the scene, not daring to breathe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Guzman stared blankly at the scene before him. Memories surged through his mind like a tidal wave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Over twenty years ago, Guzman had just come of age when the Godfather found him and forcibly sent him to the battlefield.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Please... I don't want to fight. I don't want to kill, nor be killed... I can't bear it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Guzman begged desperately but to no avail.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man nicknamed "Reaper" left him with only one sentence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A man should act like a man. You are my eldest son. You are absolutely not allowed to be a coward!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Guzman had no choice but to be forced into the military.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Over twenty years have passed, and the memories in Guzman's mind are still incredibly vivid.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Artillery raged, and flesh and blood flew. He watched his comrades fall one by one, only to be captured by a group of women.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Guzman, who had initially felt fortunate, soon realized they were a group of detestable female demons.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Guzman was still filled with fear to this day, unable to let go, and often woke up from nightmares.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These women belonged to a small tribe. Their tribe had been fighting for over a decade and had no adult males left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were in their prime, and their tribe needed to continue its bloodline. After discussing, these women decided to keep the rather handsome Guzman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>During the interrogation, Guzman suffered their torture and humiliation from those women.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Guzman tried his best to resist, facing more than a dozen strong women, he still could not escape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In less than three days, he became much thinner and could not satisfy these ravenous women.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Guzman suffered for a month. He thought he would die at their hands until intense gunfire erupted outside the camp.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He finally found a chance to escape, but he had barely run a few hundred yards when he was caught by several women and taken to an off-road vehicle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Guzman was bound and held in the vehicle all night.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, they stopped at a weathered cave in the desert.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This vast cave had a rare water source, and the temperature was much lower than the scorching heat outside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon entering the cave, they chained Guzman to a stone pillar with long iron chains.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The leading woman, named Adara, was beautiful in her twenties.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She grabbed Guzman by the collar and warned sternly, "Boy, if you dare to run away again, I will break your legs."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Guzman shook his head in terror.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That night, five women humiliated him again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From that day on, the cave became Guzman's hell.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a relaxed state, they became more and more brutal and inventive, making Guzman feel agonizing every day.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One day, the women discovered activity nearby and went out on alert, leaving Guzman alone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He accidentally found a small arm-length, two-finger-thick black short stick under a round slab of rock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the middle of the short stick was a black circular protrusion. Guzman pressed it gently, and the stick suddenly extended at both ends, turning into a black scepter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A large pale skull inexplicably appeared on top of the scepter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How could such a large skull be hidden inside a small stick? Guzman was puzzled at the time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The other end of the scepter was very sharp, and the scepter, taller than a person, could definitely be used as a spear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Accidentally acquiring a decent cold weapon, Guzman thought about escaping again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Due to the torture of those women, his lower abdomen would often bleed. </span><span>Malnourished from hunger, he was in poor health.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he stayed here for a long time, he would definitely be tortured to death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Guzman did not act rashly. If he failed to escape again, these female demons might really break his legs.</span></p><div class="pagination">
