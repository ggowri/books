  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander yanked Ava close, dodging two bullets like it was nothing. In a flash, everything went back to normal.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">How the hell did he pull that off! William stared at Alexander, looking like he'd seen a ghost in broad daylight.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Regret hit him hard. No amount of cash, not even ten million bucks, was worth messing with this... freak.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Without thinking twice, William turned tail and ran. As he bolted, he frantically mashed buttons on a remote.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Boom!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A car in the parking lot went up in flames.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The fireball shot into the sky, tossing nearby cars around like toys.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Shrapnel and shockwaves tore through the air, sending reporters flying like ragdolls.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Screams pierced the chaos. Some stumbled about with bloodied faces, others ran blindly in panic, while a few crawled desperately across the ground.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava's face drained of color. In a heartbeat, Alexander pulled her tight against him, shielding her from the mayhem.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When the powerful shockwave slammed into him, Alexander channeled The Force to create a resilient energy barrier around his body.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Though he staggered back a few steps, he remained completely unharmed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Ava, stay put here. I'm going after that assassin!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander pressed Ava behind a flower bed, then took off in pursuit of the fleeing William.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Think you can get away?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander kept William locked in his Force-enhanced senses. Within a hundred yards, there was nowhere to hide.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This guy was indeed a formidable killer! Not only were his plans meticulous and vicious, but he'd also planted bombs to cover his escape.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander let The Force flow through his entire body, instantly becoming light as a feather and fleet of foot.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He deftly weaved through the traffic and crowds, rapidly closing in on William.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Soon, Alexander spotted William's silhouette darting towards a park on the street corner.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The park was densely vegetated with an artificial lake. It was perfect for hiding or making a quick getaway.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander swiftly scooped up a rock and hurled it at William's retreating form with all his might.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Propelled by The Force, the fist-sized stone whistled through the air like a cannonball, slamming into William's back with brutal force.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Ah!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">William let out an agonized scream as he crashed hard onto the grass.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">William tried to get up, but a searing pain shot through his back, slamming him to the ground once more.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His bones broke!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">William's fierce glare was filled with terror and disbelief.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He was wearing the latest model of body armor, designed to stop bullets and knives, yet a mere rock had shattered his bones.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Damn! Alexander must be some kind of demon! His strength was inhuman!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Thank God for the armor, or that rock would've killed him outright.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">William took a deep breath, fighting through the excruciating pain tearing through his back, and stumbled to his feet, staggering towards the forest.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He had to run!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Run like hell!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Only by escaping that terrifying monster did he stand a chance of survival.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">William cursed himself bitterly. Five million dollars was a lot, but it wasn't worth squat compared to his life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander was somewhat surprised. This hitman was no joke.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He'd taken Alexander's full-force blow, one that had shattered the rock itself, yet he wasn't down for the count and could still run.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Do you think you can get away?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander quickened his pace, a cold smirk playing on his lips.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the park, near the lake, hidden in a pitch-black grove.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">William tumbled onto the sidewalk, his back a bloody mess, crimson droplets splattering the ground.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He gasped for air, his face as white as a sheet.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Were you nowhere left to run? Spill the beans on who hired you, and I might just let you live."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander appeared before him, cool as a cucumber, not even breaking a sweat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">William stared at Alexander, terror etched across his face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This guy was downright terrifying, especially those eyes that seemed to see right through him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You... you dodged bullets... What are you, some kind of superhuman? "</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">William stuttered, his words tripping over themselves.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">For the first time in his life, someone had filled him with bone-chilling fear.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Cut the crap. Who's pulling your strings?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander closed in, his graceful steps reminiscent of a regal emperor.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">William's face contorted as he felt the total weight of Alexander's overwhelming presence. His whole body shook uncontrollably.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Not talking? You got a death wish?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander's tone grew increasingly ruthless.</p><div class="pagination">
