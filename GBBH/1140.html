  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The bald man's expression darkened as he stepped forward, his voice sharp. "Who the hell are you guys? Don't you know we booked this place already?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stephen's gaze turned cold, and he snapped his head toward Joaquin. "What the hell's going on? This place is supposed to be ours. What are all these random people doing here? How am I supposed to relax while this is going on?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joaquin's heart raced. The sweat started to bead on his forehead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He quickly turned to face the bald man and his group, his voice trembling but firm. "Who let you in? Get out. We're not open today."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The bald man's face twisted with anger. He grabbed Joaquin by the collar, lifting him off the ground. "What did you say? Say that again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm Brock Stone. I paid ten days ago for this reservation. You can't just cancel it now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joaquin's blood boiled. This wasn't how things were supposed to go. "Mr. Stone, right? I'll refund your money, no problem. But we're hosting some very important guests today. We can't accommodate anyone else."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brock's hand cracked across Joaquin's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't you dare mess with me! I paid. This place is mine today. You didn't say anything about being closed. Don't start making excuses now!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're talking about 'important guests'? No one's more important than my woman. It's her birthday today, and I don't care if you're open or not. If she's not happy, I'll burn this place down."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joaquin's cheek throbbed the sting of the slap still fresh. He couldn't believe Brock actually hit him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You think just because you're some gang boss, you can pull this crap here?" Joaquin shot back, trying to stay calm. "Get out now. Or you'll regret it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brock grinned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're talking tough. No one dares to talk to me like that in </span><span>Louvian</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll give you one last chance. Either treat us right, or things are going to get ugly."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brianna, the woman with Brock, cut in with a high-pitched whine, "Yeah! You took our money, so why are you giving us trouble? It's my birthday. I want the whole place to myself! Don't make me lose face!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brock's crew, numbering over a dozen, started chanting in agreement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, get everyone else out! We're here for Brianna, and if she's not happy, we'll burn this place down!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You heard him! Move people out, or we'll do it for you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get out of the way, you </span><span>Risun</span><span> lackeys. You want me to handle this for you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brock and his men shouted and jeered, making the whole room tense. Stephen's face darkened his anger barely contained.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Brock, I'll double the deposit and refund you, but we're not doing business here today."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joaquin clenched his fists, struggling to keep his cool. He knew time was running out. If this went on much longer, Stephen would be even angrier, and that was a disaster waiting to happen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Another slap rang out, this time harder than before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Compensation? You think I need your chump change?" Brock sneered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're breaking the deal, disrespecting my woman. This isn't just about money now. If Brianna isn't happy, I'm not happy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you don't give us the whole place today, I swear I'll burn this place down!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joaquin's face turned red with fury. "You think you can burn my shop down? Go </span><span>ahead, but you'll regret it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Stephen here, Joaquin wasn't worried. In front of Stephen, Brock was nothing but a bug, crushed without a second thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brock flicked his wrist, and one of his men pulled out a machete, slashing the restaurant's sign clean in half.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The rest of the gang pulled out weapons, like knives, axes, and military blades, glinting under the lights, threatening and deadly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joaquin instinctively stepped back his legs shaky.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Move out of the way, worthless scum!" Stephen shoved Joaquin aside, his eyes flashing like steel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, you're scared? Not too late." Brock gave a smug smile, twirling his machete with practiced ease.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let them in!" Stephen ordered, his voice final and cold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joaquin trembled, realizing Stephen wasn't just angry. He was ready to make sure these guys paid for their disrespect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You've got some brains. I'll give you that. If not, I'd have torched this place without a second thought!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brock gave Stephen a dismissive glance, then waved his hand. With a swagger in his step, he led Brianna and his men into the restaurant as if they owned the place.</span></p><div class="pagination">
