  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kirk Harris, the owner of Dragonstone Gem Company, paused for a moment, then burst into laughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Haha, Ms. Blackburn, you must be joking! You've got every gemstone imaginable at Astral Bistro. Why would you need anything from me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He gave Alexander a skeptical once-over. High-quality gemstones weren't cheap&mdash;they easily cost millions of dollars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Alexander dressed so casually, Harris doubted he could afford such a purchase.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, Alexander's All-seeing Eyes picked up something unusual&mdash;a dark mass of negative energy concentrated around Harris' left chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a sign of an impending heart attack, a very dangerous situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Alexander didn't mention it, instead smiling as he said,</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Harris, I need a batch of gemstones&mdash;the higher the quality, the better. Price isn't an issue. I'm willing to pay ten percent above market rate."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harris' eyes lit up. This kid was serious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He immediately turned on the charm, "Alex, don't worry. If you're Ms. Blackburn's future son-in-law, you're family. I promise you'll get the best deal. Want to see the goods?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sure, let's take a look!" Alexander was genuinely excited.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harris led them into the warehouse, which wasn't much smaller than Astral Bistro's.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander searched the whole place, but nothing caught his eye&mdash;just some decent-quality stones, but nothing top-tier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feeling disappointed, Alexander was about to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for Harris' health, it wasn't his problem&mdash;no need to get involved with someone he had no connection to.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, something caught his attention.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His All-seeing Eyes detected a faint glow coming from an inconspicuous corner.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was a pile of discarded, low-quality gemstones&mdash;dusty and dull, clearly leftover rejects that hadn't been worth keeping. Who knew how long they'd been sitting there?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But within that pile, a faint red glimmer stood out to Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is a top-tier ruby. It's small, but it's definitely a high-quality piece!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's heart skipped a beat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To upgrade his level-one lightsaber core to level two, he needed seven high-quality gemstones of different colors&mdash;red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The ruby was tiny, about the size of a peanut, hidden inside a piece of low-grade stone. That's why it had been overlooked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Buried under the other discarded stones, Alexander almost missed it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He moved quickly, digging through the pile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sound of stones clattering echoed in the warehouse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, he pulled out the gem.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was covered in a dull red layer, barely recognizable as a gemstone&mdash;more like some worthless rock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harris watched Alexander, puzzled. He'd seen Alexander comb through the warehouse, looking unimpressed, which had annoyed him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now Alexander was pulling a random piece of junk from the pile and seemed thrilled. Harris couldn't figure it out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, you must be mistaken. That's not a gemstone&mdash;it's just trash." Harris said, clearly confused.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's eyes locked on Harris with an intense stare.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Harris, I know you're a smart man, so let's not beat around the bush. How much do you want for this stone?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harris' heart skipped a beat&mdash;he suddenly felt like Alexander could see right through him, and it made him uneasy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was something about Alexander's eyes, the way they seemed to shine, making Harris feel exposed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harris was thinking, if this really was a top-tier gem, he needed to find a way to get it back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Harris, I'll be blunt&mdash;this is a high-quality ruby. Your people missed it, but now it's in my hands. Taking it back isn't an option."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander spoke with calm confidence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, let me be honest too. If this really is a top-tier gemstone, I'd rather put it up for auction. I won't let it go that easily."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harris' tone grew more serious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lynn's expression </span><span>darkened,</span><span> her voice sharp as she spoke up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Harris, isn't this a bit much? Alex was the one who found it. If he hadn't noticed it, you would've tossed it as junk!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
