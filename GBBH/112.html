  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Jackson forced a smile, trying to ease the tension in the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come on, Felicity's still young. It's normal for her </span><span>to have hard feelings</span><span>. She just doesn't know me well enough yet. Once we start dating and get to know each other better, I'm sure she'll come around.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, let's eat and chat. Sure, I'm older, but that maturity is my </span><span>edge</span><span>. Once Felicity sees who I really am, she'll </span><span>accept me</span><span>."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jackson was determined not to let Felicity slip away, and his forced cheerfulness managed to lighten the atmosphere.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felicity felt trapped, her mind racing like a thousand ants crawling under her skin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought, "Not a single person in the Fairfax family is on my side! Wait! Didn't I just see Alexander? Could he really be here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a moment of desperation, she pulled out her phone and sent a message, pretending to be nonchalant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, in the most luxurious private room, Oscar raised his glass, offering a polite toast to Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, I owe you my gratitude for saving me last time. I've been meaning to thank you properly, so here's to you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander clinked his glass with a smile. "Sir Stewart, any news on the yellow gemstone I need?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Oscar quickly replied, "Actually, I called you here for a reason. We've found a top-notch yellow gemstone."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joy surged through Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's fantastic news! Thank you, Sir Stewart!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Oscar's expression turned slightly embarrassed as he continued, "But I must apologize, Alexander. This gemstone is so precious that even the head of the Kaylon family </span><span>wanted it</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Therefore, it will have to go to auction, and you can participate in the bidding."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander shrugged it off</span><span>. A</span><span>uction</span><span> was no big deal</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the immense wealth from the Saint Group and the promising prospects of the magic powder, he wasn't afraid of anyone when it came to money.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Alexander's calm reaction, Oscar finally relaxed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He feared that if Alexander became upset, Alexander might stop </span><span>treating</span><span> him. The thought of Parkinson's disease resurfacing was terrifying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, the auction is still </span><span>on the</span><span> way. After this magic powder conference, you can gather some funds. If you need financial help, I'm here for you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thanks, Sir Stewart, but I'm not worried about money," Alexander replied, raising his glass with a grin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, his phone buzzed with a message.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander initially thought it was from Ava, and a wave of happiness washed over him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But when he checked, he froze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander mused, "Felicity? I'm divorced from Jane, and I've already given the Fairfax family </span><span>the price</span><span>. What does she want?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The message read: [Alexander, I'm in Room 99 at Astral Bistro. My parents are trying to force me to marry an old man, the so-called Mr. Gellar, the magic powder developer. I can't stand him! Can you help me get out?]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a moment of hesitation, Alexander decided he couldn't ignore </span><span>the so-called </span><span>Mr. Gellar</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sir Stewart, I need to step out for a bit. A friend of mine is in a bit of trouble, and I have to handle it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Back in Room 99, Jackson was boasting about the struggles he faced while developing the magic powder, detailing his bursts of inspiration with exaggerated flair, earning rounds of applause from Andrew and the others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After finishing his tale, Jackson grinned and said, "I have no problem giving the general agency to the Brilliant Group, but Felicity has to spend the night with me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And the Fairfax family needs to </span><span>give me</span><span> a fifty-million-dollar deposit. After all, the Brilliant Group's billion dollar won't go through without a contract."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wait, what?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Andrew and Belinda exchanged glances, clearly hesitant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't that they cared about their youngest daughter; they were simply reluctant to part with 50 million dollars&mdash;the entire fortune of the Fairfax family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jackson frowned</span><span>, displeased</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's wrong? Not willing? You think you can play the game without putting anything on the table?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Andrew quickly put on a smile. "Mr. Gellar, isn't 50 million a bit </span><span>too much</span><span>?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jackson slammed </span><span>the glass</span><span> on the table with force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fifty hundred million is just pocket change to me&mdash;I </span><span>can </span><span>make</span><span> it</span><span> in a single day! </span><span>I </span><span>just need you to show me</span><span> your sincerity. </span><span>But</span><span> now I see it loud and clear! </span><span>You</span><span>'ve got none!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stood up, ready to walk out, but Jane was quick to grab his arm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane turned to Andrew, her voice rising in urgency. "Dad, what are you </span><span>waiting</span><span> for?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>It</span><span>&rsquo;</span><span>s</span><span> just a deposit! Once Mr. Gellar and the Brilliant Group finalize the deal, you'll get it back for sure!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane's heart raced. She was terrified; if this deal fell through, she could lose her shot at the vice president position and the hundred-million-dollar salary that came with it.</span></p><div class="pagination">
