  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A dazzling plate-sized light ball blasted straight towards Galo. He slightly sidestepped to avoid it. Looking down, he saw a black-and-white striped tiger on the ground. It was opening its huge mouth, showing off its power to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Galo thought, "How dare a beast challenge me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A fierce light flickered in Galo's eyes. A bright white flame shot out from his feet, and his figure set off a dazzling air wave. In an instant, he reached above Tigris' head, ready to kill it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn!" Galo shouted. A sound like splitting rocks filled the air, and a violent internal energy had reached his waist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing that he had no time to dodge, Galo screamed, "Hell Defense!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Galo closed his mouth and held his breath. His short and fat body instantly turned green. The bumps on his ears suddenly split open, looking like a pair of toad eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Time stopped. Alexander stood behind Galo, like a sculpture. His muscles bulged, and his arms were like a huge pestle. His hand had already touched Galo's battle armor, but it couldn't move even a little bit. Alexander was desperate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone around, regardless of friend or foe, was frozen. It seemed that even the sound of the wind and the chirping of birds had disappeared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmm! There are too many people here. I can't hold my breath anymore!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Galo's face turned red from holding his breath. He didn't even attack Alexander but turned to run away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Behind a big tree in the distance, Galo opened his big mouth, exhaled a breath, and slumped to the ground. He thought, "That young man doesn't have strong combat power, but why didn't he die after taking one of my strikes? There are too many people there. I couldn't hold my breath. Damn it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was amused, thinking, "Just like in Dragon Ball, Galo can stop time, but he can't hold his breath. So, is Hell Force the Kit Force?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's expression changed constantly as he thought, "I heard Declan in the Outer Court Martial Arts Hall say that there are five types of devils: colors, feeling, perception, volition, and consciousness. Could they be the five members of the Hell Force? Galo doesn't look human now. He has green toad-like skin and four eyes. His skin is covered in scabs."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tigris growled in the direction where Galo was. Alexander, with a gloomy face, patted Tigris' head and stroked the Black Iron Ring. He thought, "To defeat Galo, the only way is..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After resting for a while, Galo suddenly stood up and clenched his fists. Anger filled his four-toad eyes. He thought, "How dare that guy attack me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A bright white flame spurted from his feet, drawing an arc, and he rushed toward the Hrodvik camp like a rocket.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Galo thought, "Huh! Where did that despicable guy go?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In mid-air, Galo flew around, and his four frog eyes blinked as he searched around.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Take this!" In the camp, Enoch and Hogan shouted. They threw the spears in their hands with all their might. A golden light blasted straight towards Galo's chest, and a fierce flame shot towards Galo's back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tigris let out a deafening roar. Electric arcs flashed on its hind legs. With a sudden kick, it leaped up and bit at Galo's calf.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Galo let out a strange cry. A flame appeared on his feet. With a leap, he avoided all the attacks. His fat body made a big spin, and he kicked Tigris' waist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a bang, Tigris was sent flying like a swatted fly, falling straight to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Galo finished his big spin, and the smug look on his face hadn't faded yet. Just then, a roar rang out. "Energy Plot Attack!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No way!" Galo had no time to dodge. A thick dazzling light-column shot up towards him from the Hrodvik camp like a thunderbolt and hit his back hard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A dazzling light explosion engulfed Galo.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Frieza, standing on the high cliff in the distance with his hands behind his back, narrowed his strange eyes. "This Hrodvik guy can increase his combat power without transforming! Galo is really good for nothing!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In mid-air, the light explosion hadn't dissipated yet. A dazzling blue light shot up from the Hrodvik camp like a crossbow bolt, shooting into the aftermath of the light explosion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were a series of bangs. Two figures, one tall and one short, were sent flying backward dozens of feet from the aftermath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Galo's body was emitting wisps of smoke. His striped battle armor was broken. Blood was oozing from the corner of his mouth, and his four toad eyes bulged like bulbs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He glared at Alexander and shouted frantically, "Fuck you! How dare you injure me? I'll kill you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander spat out a mouthful of golden blood and snorted coldly. A fierce light burst out in his eyes. He suddenly twisted and made a false grip with both hands at his waist. Soon, dazzling electric arcs flickered all over his body. Countless white light spots instantly gathered between his hands, and a silver-white dazzling light ball appeared.</span></p><div class="pagination">
