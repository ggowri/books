  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn! This </span><span>casino's</span><span> definitely got some kind of bad mojo. It just won't let me win. The whole vibe is messed up," Barry cursed, preparing to switch tables.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sir, would you like to try the card tables?" asked the dealer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barry responded immediately, "Sure, where do we play?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The dealer swayed her hips as she walked up beside him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She said sweetly, "Sir, let me take you to the VIP room. A master like you deserves the best. You'll love it there."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barry chuckled, giving her a playful squeeze. "A master, huh? You sure know how to </span><span>talk."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Through her earpiece, the dealer had already received orders to squeeze every last bit of money from this group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix was not happy to hear that, knowing that the VIP room in a casino was a trap designed to bleed patrons dry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barry was already losing badly at the standard tables. If he went to the VIP room, Felix could hardly imagine how much he'd lose.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this rate, Barry might end up losing tens of billions, and Felix would be ruined alongside him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Morris, let's not go to the VIP room. Let's just keep things light and play here. Small stakes are fun enough," Felix advised.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shut up!" Barry cut him off sharply. "What's your problem, Felix? You're bad luck. If you're going to be so stingy, don't count on my help against Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you keep talking like that, get lost."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joyce echoed, "Exactly. What, do you think our boss doesn't have the money? Just because you've lost a little, now you're acting stingy? Pathetic."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barry snorted, "Felix, think carefully."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I..." Felix held back his anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had to put up with this for the sake of dealing with Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But deep down, he resented Barry more than ever.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sir, this way to the VIP room." The dealer led the way with an exaggerated catwalk.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the surveillance room, all eyes were on the screen displaying Barry and his companions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Overing, here's the report on Barry," said an assistant, hurrying over with a file in hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We've got two VIP experts in the house. Finley Boyd and Jaylon Ingram both have played against Barry before. He's a gambling addict, but his skills are terrible. He lost a fortune to them in the past."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Kaylon entertainment center employed numerous gambling pros who specialized in draining wealthy clients, and Finley and Jaylon were two of the best. Both ranked among the world's top 100 gambling experts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cole chuckled, "Perfect. Send Finley and Jaylon to the VIP room to play with him. They're old rivals. Barry's going to lose everything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's see if we can strip him down to his underwear. The Morris family will lose all face."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laughter erupted in the room as they pictured Barry's impending downfall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barry was about to walk into the trap, ready to be exploited.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sir, this is our casino's finest VIP room," said the dealer, leading him to the entrance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The room's decor was more luxurious than a palace, with gold adorning every surface like a scene from a fairytale.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the door opened, a mocking voice rang out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, look who it is. Mr. Morris, back for more. This is going to be fun."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's you two." Barry immediately recognized Finley and Jaylon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He cursed, "Finley, you bastard. I swear, tonight I'll make you lose everything."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix realized that Barry had suffered losses to these two before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finley and Jaylon sneered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I seem to remember you losing 500 million, or was it one billion last time? Didn't someone even end up stripped down in the end? Hahaha." Finley laughed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't remind him about his embarrassments," Jaylon added with a mocking grin. "Even if Barry is a big name, he's just dumb when it comes to gambling."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With exaggerated smirks and gestures, they taunted Barry.</span></p><div class="pagination">
