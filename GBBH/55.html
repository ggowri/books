  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava said solemnly, "Sir Stewart, you're the man of the world."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Many big shots started from scratch and rose from commoners to important figures at the top."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Alexander is definitely not the loser you think. You've underestimated him."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Even if he remains ordinary in the future, he is not a loser. Everyone has his own lifestyle and pursuit."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Sir Stewart, you can't say that most ordinary people in the world are losers, can you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Oscar was baffled. He parted his lips, but no words came out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He said, "Forget it. Let's talk about the alliance. To deal with the Brilliant Group and the Cripples, we have to work together, so the turfs and benefits will be divided equally."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava looked at Oscar sullenly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Except for drugs, the Saint Group possesses half of the turfs in Loscity. The Brilliant Group has less than 20%, and the Kaylon, the Blood Gang, and the Cripples have 30% together."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Sir Stewart, it's insincere of you to split them equally between us."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Oscar chuckled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He said, "If we don't work together, I'm afraid you can't protect Alexander. Joseph is very vindictive."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava was unusually calm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Joseph is no match for Alexander. We work together for our own benefit, not to protect Alexander."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Oscar sneered, "If you don't protect him, I'm sure he will be killed by the Cripples very soon."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava thought for a moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She said, "Sir Stewart, let's make a bet. I bet Alexander can eliminate the influence of the Brilliant Group and the Cripples in Loscity for us."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"In a month at most, the turfs in Loscity will be reshuffled."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"A month? Are you sure?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Oscar burst into laughter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Ms. Blackburn, do you believe what you say? Although Loscity is the headquarters of the Saint Group, the combined strength of Brilliant Group and the Cripples is not inferior."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava was silent for a while before chuckling softly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If he can't do that, we'll discuss how to divide the benefits then."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If he makes it, whoever grabs it will get it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava sounded confident and menacing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was obvious that she wanted to force Oscar to form an unconditional alliance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Oscar was cunning and got what Ava meant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He snorted softly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay, let's ally for one month. But during this month, the Kaylon won't help you. We will only watch the show."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"And I have one condition. You have to meet my grandson."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Hearing this, Ava couldn't help laughing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Sir Stewart, you still want me to be your granddaughter-in-law? I agree to that if I'm only asked to meet him."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Oscar was overjoyed. "Do you really agree?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes, of course. I will meet him, but I don't promise you anything else."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava smiled cunningly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I believe in Alexander. With his skills and my planning, the Saint Group may have a chance to beat them during the month."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her words angered Oscar.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He chuckled and said, "Okay, okay. I'll give you a month to see if Alexander is worthy of your trust."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay, it's settled."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava rose with satisfaction and turned to leave.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Before leaving, she turned around and gave a reminder.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Sir Stewart, I advise you to go to the hospital for a full check-up. It would be troublesome if you're attacked by Parkinson's Disease."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Oscar was so angry that he thumped his cane.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He said coldly, "Thank you for your concern, Ms. Blackburn. I'm in good health. Neither you nor Alexander need to worry about me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Jack, show our guest the way out."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After Ava left the Kaylon, she couldn't help but murmur in a low voice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Alexander, please don't let me down..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At this moment, Alexander was meeting Anne.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mr. Hawthorne, this is the meteorite you asked me to find. The test has confirmed the meteorite contains metal."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Anne had a black metal box brought over.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Some meteorites might be radioactive, so they had to be put in a radiation-proof box.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander opened the box with joy and put his hand on the basketball-sized meteorite, feeling it with his Force.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Anne was confused. What was Alexander doing?</p><div class="pagination">
