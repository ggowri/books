  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With all the Cripples sprawled out on the ground, </span><span>Houtte</span><span> stood there, utterly alone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander brushed a few stray strands of hair from his forehead, straightened his suit, and walked toward the stunned </span><span>Houtte</span><span> with the grace of a dancer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Houtte</span><span> felt numb, thinking, "I brought over fifty of my best men!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And they all fell before Alexander in just a matter of minutes? Is he even human?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Houtte</span><span> stammered, panic rising in his chest, "Alexander, this is a misunderstanding! Please, don't come any closer! It was David who made me do this... it's all a mistake!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, </span><span>Houtte</span><span> pulled out his handgun, aiming it at Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But his hands trembled, betraying his fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander didn't seem to notice the gun; he continued to advance calmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop right there! I swear, if you keep coming, I'll take you down!" </span><span>Houtte</span><span> shouted, his voice rising in desperation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet Alexander ignored him, closing the distance until he was just about ten feet away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With gritted teeth, </span><span>Houtte</span><span> squeezed the trigger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Three shots rang out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava gasped, thinking, "Why is Alexander charging toward a barrel of a gun?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a flash, everyone witnessed a breathtaking scene.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander twisted and turned with lightning speed, effortlessly evading every bullet that was fired at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Houtte</span><span> panicked and emptied his magazine, each shot echoing like thunder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, not a single bullet found its mark, not even brushing against Alexander's suit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh my God! You're not human! You're a demon&mdash;a creature straight out of hell!" </span><span>Houtte</span><span> squealed in horror.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a fit of terror, </span><span>Houtte</span><span> tossed his gun aside and scrambled away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander casually kicked a stone on the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The rock whizzed through the air like a bullet and struck </span><span>Houtte's</span><span> right leg.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It created a gruesome wound that bled profusely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm sorry! I didn't mean it! This is all a misunderstanding&mdash;David made me do this! Please, spare me!" </span><span>Houtte</span><span> cried, collapsing to the ground in a pitiful display.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With tears mixing with snot, he begged for his life, completely abandoning his previous bravado.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the distance, sirens began to wail; the cops were on their way, drawn by the chaos.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander turned briefly to the driver of the Rolls-Royce. "You keep Ms. Blackburn safe until the police arrive."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he scooped up </span><span>Houtte</span><span> like a hawk with its prey and sprinted away with surprising speed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Houtte</span><span>, towering at six foot three and weighing over two hundred pounds, felt as light as a feather in Alexander's grip.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, inside the luxurious vehicle, David was frantically urging the driver.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's taking so long? Hurry up, or he's going to catch us!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The driver slammed on the gas, tires screeching as they tore down the street.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>David sighed in relief, confident that Alexander wouldn't outrun the car's speed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once they turned the corner ahead, they'd lose him completely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But suddenly, a deafening crash echoed through the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the blink of an eye, a body propelled through the sky like a projectile, smashing through the windshield and landing violently in the driver's seat, sending shards of glass flying everywhere.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The driver screamed, his right eye punctured by a glass shard, and the car turned into a wild beast, crashing hard into a lamppost.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Airbags deployed with a loud pop, and though David escaped unscathed, he was dazed, his senses foggy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Through the haze, he caught a glimpse of the figure who had shattered the windshield: it was </span><span>Houtte</span><span>, bloodied and covered in glass shards.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes were wide with terror and disbelief, frozen in place&mdash;he was clearly dead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before David could regain his composure, Alexander tore the deformed car door open, seizing him by the neck and yanking him out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, you dare lay a hand on me? The Federer family..." David began, his bravado masking his fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shut up!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander roared, delivering a series of fierce slaps that left David spitting blood and his cheeks swollen and red.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sound of sirens grew increasingly closer, echoing through the tension-filled air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>David's eyes lit up with triumph.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The cops are here, and you really think you can get away with killing me? I'm a state senator, not some low-life scum like </span><span>you..</span><span> Ah!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His taunts were abruptly cut off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a swift motion, Alexander shoved him against a broken streetlight pole, impaling his body upon the jagged metal. Blood gushed forth, staining the surroundings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as the approaching police cars were about to round the corner, Alexander stood up, darted off, and vanished into the dense thicket of the nearby woods.</span></p><div class="pagination">
