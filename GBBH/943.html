  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander moved in a slow rhythm, barely thrusting, keeping things gentle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cloe finally managed to stay quiet, holding back any sound that might slip out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Click, click, click..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sound of high heels echoed closer&mdash;definitely a woman approaching.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With his All-seeing eyes, Alexander already saw who it was. It was the young woman he'd saved earlier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Probably here for the auction, Alexander thought to himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He kept his hands firmly on Cloe's hips, staying deep inside her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cloe moved her hips slowly, just enough to keep things going without making any noise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What a naughty girl.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander couldn't help but give her breasts a playful squeeze, and Cloe almost let out a moan&mdash;barely holding it in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The woman entered one of the stalls, and soon the sound of rushing water followed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander felt himself twitch inside Cloe from the excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cloe's mouth opened in a silent gasp, her face showing a mix of pain and pleasure as she struggled to keep herself under control.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Alexander thought the woman was just there for the restroom, her phone rang.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, I'm here now... Is everything ready? Good! We can't fail this time with Fox Hunt. Once we get Alexander, the Ghost will finally have his secrets..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The woman's words made Alexander's expression go cold, and even Cloe seemed to snap out of her lust-driven state.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The woman soon left, her high heels clicking as she walked away, and Cloe let out a sigh of relief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She turned her head slightly and asked, "Sir, what do we do now? Should we grab her immediately?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander considered it for a moment. "It's not the Mafia&mdash;it's the Ghost... What exactly is that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cloe's face turned serious as she explained,</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Ghost is rumored to be an organization made up of some of the most powerful political figures around the world&mdash;people right at the top of the power structure."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander let out a dry chuckle. "Never thought I'd be on their list. Alright then, let's have some fun with these Ghost folks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But for now, I'm not done here. Let's pick up where we left off."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The earlier interruption had dulled some of their excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cloe arched her back obediently, waiting for Alexander to start again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander picked up the pace, his thrusts growing faster and harder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cloe's whole body tensed, her teeth sinking into her bottom lip as she tried not to make a sound&mdash;still afraid someone might hear them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though the woman was gone, Cloe still felt the thrill of doing something so risky.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>More footsteps echoed in the hallway, along with the faint sound of someone talking on the phone&mdash;more guests arriving for the auction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cloe's body instinctively tightened in response, making Alexander groan from the sensation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Having his way with a beautiful woman in a public restroom while people walked by outside&mdash;it was an undeniable thrill.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander could feel the adrenaline rush, his grip tightening on Cloe's hips as he moved with intensity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cloe's body grew even more tense, and she clamped a hand over her mouth, trying to keep quiet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The way she clenched around him&mdash;it was almost unbelievable how worked up she was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite all her efforts, Cloe couldn't entirely suppress her soft whimpers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander let his hand drift down from her shoulder, slipping under her shirt, grabbing her breasts, squeezing them roughly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cloe just stood there, legs pressed tightly together, trying to match Alexander's rhythm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Desire burned between them, and Cloe wasn't holding back anymore. She turned her head, desperate for his kiss.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander leaned into her ear, whispering,</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You really are a naughty girl. If you love this thrill so much, maybe next time we'll do it right out on the street."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cloe shivered, her body tightening around him even more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By now, coherent thought was out of the question&mdash;all she wanted was for Alexander to take her </span><span>completely,</span><span> to feel every ounce of pleasure he could give her.</span></p><div class="pagination">
