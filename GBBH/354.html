  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing their plan outside, Alexander was shocked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>SATAN, the Godfather of the Mafia, was actually going to deal with his father.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Indeed, if two men rode on a horse, one must ride behind. Besides, Alexander's father was old, while SATAN should still be in his prime.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Arthur, tell everyone to get their weapons ready. I will personally lead the team to capture Alexander!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Despite his excellent fighting skills, he is not a superman," Timothy sneered confidently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, the door was pushed open heavily with a bang.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you going to capture me? Don't bother. I am here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander walked in very leisurely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Timothy and Arthur turned to glance at him in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Timothy and Arthur were suddenly wary.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why are you here? Are you following me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Arthur couldn't believe it. He had obviously been very cautious on his way back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, you are so arrogant!" Timothy snorted coldly, sizing Alexander up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander sat down on the sofa at ease as if he owned this place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How presumptuous!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Timothy glared at Alexander with murderous intent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ignoring him, Alexander took an orange from the fruit plate on the table, peeled it, and ate it slowly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's a bit sour..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After eating a few slices, Alexander threw the orange at Timothy provocatively.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Timothy, you say you are good at boxing, but I can defeat you with one hand."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Timothy laughed out of anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, if you can beat me with one hand, I will make </span><span>you</span><span> my boss!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You want me to be your boss? You promised yourself. Don't blame me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander chuckled confidently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Timothy was also full of confidence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No one in this world can beat me with one hand. I am sure of it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, let's not waste time then."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander grinned contemptuously and suddenly jumped up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With his left hand behind his back, he slapped Timothy on the chest with his right hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What a quick move!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Timothy caught off guard, stepped back in fright, his back covered in a cold sweat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're too slow. I can get you down in three moves with just one hand."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander mocked and started counting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The second move!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He appeared behind Timothy with a terrifying speed and slapped him on the back of the head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Timothy trembled violently in fright. If Alexander had planned to kill him, the blow just now could have been fatal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although it was just a light slap, he felt an invisible force invading his body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But it was fleeting and disappeared without a trace. Could it be an illusion?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smiled and snapped his fingers. "The third move!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Timothy backed away in fear. However, Alexander did not make any unnecessary movements, and Timothy didn't feel any pain or discomfort.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed like Alexander was just joking, but Timothy's heart had sunk to the bottom, and he inexplicably panicked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it, bastard, what did you do to me? Can you do witchcraft?" Timothy asked in a trembling voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll be back in </span><span>Tijuanea</span><span> in three days, and you can come to me then."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Alexander walked away, beaming with joy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What do you mean? You bastard, explain it. Why can't I move? What did you do to me?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Timothy wanted to chase after him, but his whole body was stiff, and it was difficult for him to move even a finger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His face was pale. He never expected that he, the master of underground boxing, would be bullied like this by Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How strange!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh no! I can't move. Alexander is too weird. He must be good at witchcraft. Arthur, take me to the hospital right now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though conscious, Timothy had already collapsed to the floor powerlessly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Arthur finally came to his senses and called someone while stammering.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A large group of subordinates rushed over and were dumbfounded to see Timothy lying stiffly on the floor. Was he paralyzed?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They hurriedly carried him out of the bar and drove to the hospital.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was already on his way back to the hotel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a moment of hesitation, he finally sent a message to Alice, asking her to inform his father to be careful of "SATAN" from the Mafia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking of his father, whom he had never met, Alexander felt very complicated, indescribable emotions. Despite his hatred of him for not caring about his mother and him, he was also a little grateful to him.</span></p><div class="pagination">
