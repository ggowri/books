  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Oliver looked at Melin's furious expression, and his eyebrows furrowed. This woman was always stubborn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Chief, why can't we rescue the hostages?" Melin asked, leaning over the desk and staring at Oliver angrily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Oliver couldn't help but glance at her chest, which looked even fuller as she leaned forward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melin blushed and quickly stood up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She continued to question loudly, "Chief, they kidnapped dozens of people. Aren't you going to send the police?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Oliver remained expressionless and stern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Was there a police report?" he asked calmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melin paused and then huffed, "No, but our surveillance system detected it. I also went to the Fairfax Villa to check. Their members are indeed missing and can't be contacted."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Since there was no police report, how can we prove that the Fairfax family was kidnapped and not left voluntarily? You can leave now and wait for orders," Oliver said indifferently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He dismissed her and turned to open a file.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Chief, it is a kidnapping," Melin insisted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get out! If you say one more word, I'll suspend you," Oliver interrupted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melin stared at Oliver with anger and doubt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melin slammed the door and stormed out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Oliver sighed, staring at the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This matter involved a lieutenant general, and he couldn't and didn't dare to interfere.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, Schroder had kidnapped the Fairfax family members to deal with Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was too mysterious, and Oliver's recent investigations had shown that both the former leaders of the Cripples in </span><span>Loscity</span><span> and the Tate family had disappeared without a trace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even the leadership of the Federer family had suddenly changed because of Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were even rumors that not only the Saint Group but also the Fraternity, the Federer family, the Blood Gang, and the Kaylon all followed Alexander's lead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Oliver thought this was impossible, Alexander was clearly not someone he could offend.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it! This is a god's war," Oliver cursed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He felt helpless against Schroder or Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melin returned to her office in a huff.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She never thought that Oliver would be like others, afraid to offend Schroder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If even Oliver turned a blind eye, no one else would dare to interfere.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the righteous Melin was determined to gather evidence and rescue the hostages.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melin got fully armed, with several police officers by her side.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One officer reported, "Madam, according to the surveillance system, a man named Rosen has locked up 36 members of the Fairfax family in an abandoned factory in the suburbs."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Rosen and his men are real fighters. Their skills and firepower are far beyond what we can match..." the officers discussed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madam, I advise you to listen to Oliver. We can't handle this. General Flores has an army of 50 thousand men. How many do we have in the police station?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, Madam, please think carefully. We can't act on our own, and even if we go, we'll be crushed."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melin slammed her hand on the table.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She snapped, "You cowards! If you don't dare to go, I'll go alone!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She stormed out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A few minutes later, Melin drove a police car out of the station, speeding towards the western suburbs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Following the information, she quickly arrived at the abandoned factory.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The area was desolate, with wild grass growing everywhere, and it was eerily quiet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sky was overcast, with dark clouds gathering, and it looked like it would rain soon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melin parked the car far away and quietly approached the abandoned factory.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She deliberately took a long detour and entered from the back of the factory.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although she was an experienced police officer with seven years of service, Melin felt her body temperature rise and her heartbeat quicken as the tension grew.</span></p><div class="pagination">
