  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosalia couldn't take it anymore, her body overwhelmed by an unbearable itch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Master, you're truly a pervert," she moaned, gripping Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander finally completed another round of his massage, leaving Rosalia limp in his arms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The intense stimulation from two consecutive massages had temporarily robbed her of her ability to move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander lifted her chin and asked with a smile, "Do you still have any strength left?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosalia grabbed his manhood and fiddled with it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She purred, "Master, it seems like yours has grown a bit more. You're truly a beast."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was amazed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander, aroused by her touch, pinned her down on the bed. Her legs were raised high, resting on his shoulders.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What if a man can't control himself and tries to rape you?" Alexander asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosalia felt as if a switch had been flipped inside her, filling her with both shame and excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As long as I don't consent, no one dares to..." she cried out as Alexander went in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dress more seductively. Wear a tight white shirt without a bra, so everyone can see your sexy figure." Alexander smirked, feeling </span><span>a surge of pleasure</span><span> he had never experienced before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosalia was aroused by his words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She said, "Sure. If you're willing to let </span><span>others</span><span> see me, I'll dress very seductively. No bra, and a super short skirt with no panties. Let them all look at me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tsk, you're truly a vixen," Alexander exclaimed, feeling himself swell.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosalia opened her mouth to scream, but the pleasure was so intense that she couldn't make a sound.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, there was a knock at the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne, are you there?" It was the voice of the hotel attendant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosalia was startled and quickly covered her mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander calmly replied, "I'm busy right now. Come back later."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sound outside the door ceased, but Alexander's keen senses told him that the attendant hadn't left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead, the attendant had moved closer to the door, likely eavesdropping.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander leaned in close to Rosalia's ear and whispered, "He's listening outside. If you make a sound and he hears you, don't blame me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosalia nodded vigorously, her hand tightly covering her mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander increased his pace, and Rosalia nearly cried out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She bit her lip hard and pressed her hands firmly against her mouth. Her breasts swayed rapidly back and forth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In just a few minutes, Rosalia couldn't take it anymore. She was in a daze, her head swaying from side to side.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander had no choice but to let her go.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're no good anymore, completely useless," he said, smacking her bottom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Go see what the attendant wants, or he'll knock again."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She slowly got up from the bed. Her movements were sluggish and difficult, as she had exhausted all her energy in their intense activity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She quickly dressed and stumbled to the door, opening it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was flushed. Her clothes were disheveled, and her chest prominently displayed two points.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The attendant, upon seeing her, was instantly aroused.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stammered, "Is Mr. Hawthorne here? Miss Nancy sent some documents over."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosalia took the documents and shut the door firmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander embraced her from behind and said with a grin, "That attendant wants to sleep with you. Should I let him?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosalia was embarrassed. "No, I don't want anyone else. Only you, Master."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander pressed her down onto the bed again...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, at the Kaylon entertainment center, the day was reaching its busiest hour.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The casino hall was as luxurious as a palace, with hundreds of gaming tables arranged in an orderly fashion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were pokers, dice games, roulette, and more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the surrounding smaller halls, there were various slot machines and gaming machines, each one crowded with people.</span></p><div class="pagination">
