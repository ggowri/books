Even if he dodged, he would face a storm of attacks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mike and Tony were excited, sure that Alexander would be beaten.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Be careful!" Melin cried out, fearing that Alexander couldn't withstand such a fierce attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She tried to pull Alexander back, but he stood his ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smiled mockingly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To him, their attacks were child's play.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"These are Schroder's elite men? Their punches are slow," he taunted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His </span><span>fist</span><span> shot out to attack Mike.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His move seemed slow and light, but it struck Mike's chest like lightning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A crack echoed as Mike was thrown back, crashing to the ground and spitting blood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tony's knife missed, and Alexander kicked him in the face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tony screamed, holding his face as blood flowed from his fingers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a blink, the two men who had the upper hand were now defeated, writhing on the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The room fell silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosen was the first to react. "Kill him! Fire..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before he could finish, Alexander grabbed his throat and held him as a shield.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The others raised their guns.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But they dared not shoot with Rosen in the way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smiled, "Rosen, if you don't want to die, let me take Sir Fairfax and Melin away."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosen was irritated, but he didn't want to die.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he refused, Alexander would surely kill him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's grip tightened, and Rosen felt like he was being choked by an iron collar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll let them go," he gasped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander shouted at the others, "Didn't you hear your boss? Let Sir Fairfax go!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosen waved his hand weakly. "Let him go."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His men had to obey.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They only had to release an old man, not everyone. Schroder would not punish them for it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Fairfax family members shouted, "Why not save us? Please, save us!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, why only save that old man? We are the future of the Fairfax family!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Some were pleading, while the others were either doubting or cursing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If they were not tied up, they might have confronted Frank.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander kept hold of Rosen and told Melin to help Frank leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melin refused, "No! I won't leave you behind. We'll leave together."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was speechless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked at Melin closely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was kind and brave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melin blushed and said, "What are you looking at? Don't get the wrong idea. I just want to leave with you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone was stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The tough woman was acting like a shy girl in front of Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was filled with admiration, respect, and shyness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander almost laughed, wondering if she had a crush on him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was possible. Proud women often saw their rescuers as princes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Alexander's skills and handsome looks, he certainly fit the role of a prince.</span></p><div class="pagination">
