  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Get lost! Shameless bastard!" Grace shouted, pushing him away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The others looked at Asher with mockery and ridicule.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even Ave, who had always favored Asher, changed her expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander picked up a sharp table knife and approached Gavin, speaking calmly, "Mr. Gavin Lawson's injuries are primarily in the chest, with clot compressing nerves and blood vessels. Due to their location, surgery is impossible, causing years of suffering.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Asher's medicine stimulated his body and broke its original balance, worsening his condition.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"As long as the clot in his body is released, coupled with my treatment, he will be cured."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander said casually, and his eyes had already locked onto the position of Gavin's left chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing this, Asher erupted, "Nonsense! You must be the one behind this. You poisoned Mr. Gavin Lawson. You want to kill him and provoke a conflict between the Avalora and Eagle Empire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Seeing he's still breathing, you wanted to use treatment as an excuse to kill him completely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What are you all waiting for? Protect Mr. Gavin Lawson!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Asher's roar startled the bodyguards, who intervened against Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The leader was a middle-aged man with an ugly scar on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He stared at Alexander warily and shouted, "You can treat him, but put down the knife first."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander shot him a cold glance and commanded, "Get out of the way!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The man paled under Alexander's imposing aura.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Don't just stand there. Grab his knife!" the man ordered, but the other bodyguards hesitated and didn't follow him to target Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They had been taught a lesson by Alexander before, and the memory was still fresh in their minds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander waved dismissively, sending the man flying back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Grace quickly reached out to stop everyone and ordered loudly, "Everyone, stop! I trust Alexander. Anyone who moves is risking my grandfather's life."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone was stunned at once.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Asher seethed but was powerless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander approached Gavin, channeling the Force into the knife, which glowed and radiated heat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Just when everyone was surprised, he stabbed it into Gavin's heart at a special angle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Blood gushed out, leaving everyone in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Swish!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander stabbed again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Blood spurted out. One could imagine how deeply Alexander had stabbed. Even most of the knife had gone in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Murder! Murder!" the crowd screamed, backing away in terror.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Grace opened her red lips. Her mind went blank. And then, she yelled angrily. "Stop! What are you doing?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She grabbed Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He replied calmly, "I'm saving your grandfather. I need to release the blood clots."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He was not panicked and used the Force Cure, pouring energy into Gavin's body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Grace was in tears, filled with grief and anger. "I trusted you so much. But you killed my grandfather?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Asher shouted triumphantly, "I told you he was a killer. Arrest him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Amid the chaos, Gavin sat up while touching his chest and cursing, "Ouch, that hurts."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The room fell silent in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Grandpa! You're not dead?" Grace exclaimed, rushing to embrace him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gavin touched his bloody chest, where the bleeding had miraculously stopped, leaving a thick scab.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He looked at Alexander with mixed emotions. "Are you trying to save me or kill me? You are too cruel. I will remember this."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander chuckled, "How else could I save you? Besides, this can only ensure that the old injury will not recur within two years, and you'll need ongoing treatment."</span></p><div class="pagination">
