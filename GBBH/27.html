  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Silence! How dare you besmirch the name of the Saint Group's chairman? Your audacity knows no bounds!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jane trembled with fury.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The room buzzed with the scornful laughter of the Fairfax family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"He's just green with envy. No amount of his blabbering can alter reality."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mr. Hawkins has earned the chairman's favor, which is a true boon for our family. Jane was wise to divorce this failure."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"He'll forever be nothing but a worthless wretch."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Frank yelled, "Enough!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His roar cut through the cacophony with authority that stilled the room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His gaze, complex and troubled, settled on Jane.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Jane, I implore you, leave Ryan and remarry Alexander. Please, for my sake..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A sneer escaped Jane.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Grandfather, you're truly lost in your years. Why would I abandon a man with a future like Ryan for Alexander, a proven failure?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Frank's face creased with urgency. "If you still see me as your elder, heed my words."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Absolutely not!" Jane retorted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Andrew rose, clamping down on Frank's shoulder.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Father, this decision is folly. Moreover, you're no longer the patriarch. I am, and my word is final."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The family rallied behind Andrew, voicing their dissent against Frank's plea.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">They all hoped to ride Ryan's coattails to glory.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Frank tried to argue further, but Alexander interjected with a dismissive wave.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Sir Fairfax, even if Jane consented, I would not. I'll treat your ailment. Then, I'll be gone."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jane blocked his path, her eyes blazing with hostility.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Save your pretense! You're planning to curse our family, aren't you? Don't even dream of touching my grandfather."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander shot an icy gaze at her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Sir Fairfax's condition remains precarious following his cerebral infarction. The delicate vessels in his brain continue to bleed uncontrollably. Every moment we delay, the peril grows. Are you aware of what hangs in the balance?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Pah! You won't fool me," Jane scoffed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She spat at Alexander's feet.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You best lift whatever spell you've cast on Ryan, or face our wrath. There are dozens here today; we could drown you in our spit."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">No sooner had she spoken than the Fairfax family surged forward. Their faces were twisted with aggression.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Frank looked livid and tried to intervene, but Andrew restrained him, leaving him voiceless in his anxiety.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander sneered, "You think you can threaten me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A shout pierced the tension.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I can't stand his arrogance! Let's take him down together!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The crowd charged, eager to prove their loyalty to Ryan and Jane.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A scream cut through the air as the first dashed forward to attack Alexander was flung back with an invisible force and collapsed into unconsciousness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Amidst the cacophony of wails and the thuds of bodies hitting the floor, seven or eight members of the Fairfax family lay strewn about in disarray in mere moments.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The rest recoiled in terror, and their faces were drained of color as if they had encountered a specter. None dared to approach Alexander.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jane stood frozen. She had been confident, certain that with a few dozen on her side, victory was assured. Yet, she hadn't anticipated Alexander's formidable prowess.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Pathetic," Alexander muttered with contempt.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Sir Fairfax, I'll schedule your treatment another day. Farewell."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With a dismissive air, Alexander found himself too indifferent to waste another moment on this assembly. Turning on his heel, he departed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Frank yelled, "Alexander!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His voice quivered with a mix of despair and sorrow.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander paused and frowned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Alexander, I know Jane has wronged you. But for the love of Ashley and myself, could you spare Jane in the future?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Hope flickered in Frank's wrinkled face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After a heavy silence, Alexander nodded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Don't worry. She's Ashley's mother. I won't end her life."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With those words, he departed from the Fairfax Villa, not once looking back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Grandfather, why plead with him? Even if he has hidden depths, can he challenge the might of the Saint Group?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Tonight, Ryan ascends to vice presidency. I'll have Alexander on his knees begging me!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jane's voice was thick with defiance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tears welled in Frank's eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Jane, you'll soon see Alexander's true capabilities. You'll regret this..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Impatient, Jane dismissed him with a wave.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"He's just got some tricks up his sleeve. Does he really think he can best Godfather, the strategic genius behind the Saint Group? Can he outmatch a bullet? Should he dare to overstep, Ryan will shoot him."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Frank opened his mouth to offer words of persuasion, but Jane presented her back to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Frank, filled with a foreboding sense of loss, could only sigh deeply as he sank into the sofa.</p><div class="pagination">
