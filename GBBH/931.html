  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"From now on, you're my slave. Whatever I tell you to do, you do it. Understood?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Keith gave </span><span>Chaalis</span><span> a sharp smack on her plump backside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, yes! You're my master. I'll do whatever you ask," </span><span>Chaalis</span><span> nodded furiously, then nestled into Keith's arms, trailing kisses along his neck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Keith nodded, satisfied. Finding Hazel wasn't a mission that could be completed overnight, but he was determined to succeed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Alexander was already on his way out of </span><span>Kylaville</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His next destinations were Treasure Island and Devil Island. Although the Sakra Society's "Apocalypse Project" had suffered a setback, Alexander was sure that old fox Yinson wouldn't let things go so easily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crisis had only been postponed; it was bound to erupt sooner or later.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If a true apocalypse hit&mdash;one straight out of a zombie horror movie&mdash;only Treasure Island and Devil Island could serve as secure strongholds for survival.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was the perfect window to fortify the islands, establish defenses, and stockpile essential resources and equipment. Food, supplies, and tools&mdash;nothing could be overlooked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for finding Hazel, Keith had infiltrated the Sakra Society, but any actionable intel would take time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Still, Alexander had promised Norma that he'd step in the moment there was any news.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Alexander's plane departed from </span><span>Kylaville</span><span>, Norma lingered at the airport, her beautiful face clouded with melancholy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tears shimmered in the corners of her eyes as she whispered, "You have to come back. I'll be waiting! Everything the Dragon Gang has is yours, and I'll protect it until you return."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She stood there murmuring to herself for a long time before reluctantly leaving, surrounded by her bodyguards.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By the time Alexander's plane landed at </span><span>Tijuanea</span><span> Airport, it was already nightfall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as he exited the jet bridge, a private car whisked him away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inside, Yvonne sat waiting, her seductive gaze locked onto Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She'd traveled all the way from the City of Sorcery just to see him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dressed provocatively, Yvonne wore a tight, low-cut top that left most of her pale, ample chest on display.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The subtle sway of her curves with every bump of the car seemed almost hypnotic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her ultra-short black skirt barely covered her thighs, leaving her long, shapely legs&mdash;and even a hint of her lower curves&mdash;completely exposed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Alexander couldn't help but steal a few extra glances. Her figure was undeniably alluring.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Master, I missed you so much! Thank you for putting me in charge of the City of Sorcery. I wanted to give you an update in person... </span><span>heehee</span><span>!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yvonne giggled as she snuggled into Alexander's chest, running her hand over his firm torso</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smirked. His right hand slid to her round, perky hips, while his left hand </span><span>moved boldly under her neckline to cup her fullness, kneading it shamelessly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You didn't notice someone tailing us? Not sure if they're after you or me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What!?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yvonne tensed immediately, turning to glance behind them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sakra Society's just taken a hit and is busy licking its wounds. This is likely the Mafia," Alexander said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He instructed the driver to pull over, stepping out of the car alone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yvonne, looking furious, quickly followed him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their convoy of five cars came to a stop, and Yvonne's Rolls-Royce was joined by several bodyguards pouring out of the other vehicles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The dark night stretched endlessly around them, and at first glance, everything seemed calm and quiet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Yvonne began to wonder if Alexander had been mistaken, his voice rang out with commanding authority.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Everyone, take cover. Now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yvonne and the others didn't hesitate. They ducked behind bushes, trees, and the parked cars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Whirrr</span><span>... </span><span>whirrr</span><span>... </span><span>whirrr</span><span>..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moments later, the low hum of rotors grew louder, a telltale sign of an approaching helicopter. In the distance, a military chopper came into view, speeding toward them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it! It's armed! Boss, you need to take cover too!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yvonne shouted in </span><span>alarm,</span><span> her voice tinged with panic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Alexander stood boldly in the middle of the road, illuminated by the car's headlights like a beacon in the dark&mdash;a perfect target.</span></p><div class="pagination">
