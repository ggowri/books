  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, everyone turned pale.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's strike was so dazzling that it seemed to eclipse the moon itself, leaving only the brilliant glow of the Lightsaber.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In reality, the exchange between Alexander and Raven had taken only a few seconds, yet it felt as if an eternity had passed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Raven's body vanished without a trace in the flames of Force Burning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A deathly silence fell over the scene.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix, watching the scene unfold through a surveillance camera from afar, turned pale, his eyelid twitching frantically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He never expected that Raven, a </span><span>swordmaster</span><span> and a level-one metahuman, would fall so swiftly to Alexander's blade.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kyle had been killed by Alexander before. Intelligence suggested that he might have mastered freezing power, but Alexander had just used fire power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What kind of power did Alexander possess? What was his level?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kyle was dead, and now Raven was dead too. Felix felt a headache coming on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn Alexander! This is outrageous!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix gnashed his teeth, filled with unease.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if he mobilized the current hundred or so men, they might not be able to stop Alexander, especially since Alexander had brought more men than he did.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Alexander stepped onto the stairs, about to enter the manor, a large group of people emerged from around the corner, striding hurriedly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Colonel Hawthorne, please wait!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The leaders were two older men walking side by side.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Behind them was a group of well-trained soldiers, fully armed, moving in unison, and exuding an imposing aura.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's gaze swept over them, and they immediately noticed several metahumans among the soldiers. He stopped in his tracks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One of the two leading elders was an acquaintance of his, the commander of the Northern Command, four-star General Quentin, also Brittany's grandfather.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The other was similarly dressed in a general's uniform. From the shoulder and chest insignia, his rank seemed to be on par with Quentin's.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The only difference was that this man's shoulder insignia featured a silver longsword, the symbol of the Southern Command.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hello, Colonel Hawthorne!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quentin quickened his pace with a smile. He didn't use Alexander's name informally, clearly not wanting too many people to know about their close relationship, hence addressing him by his military rank.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is the commander of the Southern Command, four-star General Theodore Wood."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quentin introduced warmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was taken aback. The arrival of two four-star generals must signify something significant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hello, General Thompson, General Wood. What can I do for you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quentin approached Alexander a bit awkwardly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Higher-ups said... the Red Umbrella Group is very important, and Felix has made contributions. You can teach him a lesson. But if something really happens to him, it would be a big deal."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Theodore stated coldly with a stern expression, "Colonel Hawthorne, although you are also an important partner to our military, you have no right to besiege the Red Umbrella Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We must prioritize the bigger picture. The projects the Red Umbrella Group is currently researching are very important. If anything happens to Felix, all previous efforts would be in vain. You can imagine the consequences if higher authorities get involved!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's eyes flashed with murderous intent as he said resolutely, "Felix kidnapped my daughter. He must die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quentin immediately clapped his chest in assurance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Colonel Hawthorne, don't worry. We are here for that very reason. Both you and Felix are important to our military. Any loss would be a great one. General Wood and I will go in now. We promise to bring Ashley out unharmed!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he pulled Theodore towards the manor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Countless soldiers swarmed behind them, fully armed, surrounding the manor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A colonel raised his gun and commanded loudly, "Without the orders of the two commanders, no one is allowed to leave or enter. Violators will be shot without mercy!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone was too shocked to speak, never expecting that the enmity between Alexander and the Red Umbrella Group would alarm the two commanders.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, not only did these two commanders persuade Alexander kindly, but they also joined forces to help him retrieve his daughter. This was an immense honor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Countless gazes focused on Alexander, filled with shock, doubt, envy, and jealousy.</span></p><div class="pagination">
