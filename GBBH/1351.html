  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop!" A distant shout echoed through the air, but before the sound could fully register, a green sword had silently approached Arturo from behind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A chill ran down Arturo's spine; he sensed the imminent danger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead of focusing on finishing off Alexander, he swiftly dodged.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, despite being badly injured and bleeding from his mouth, Alexander, who was trapped in a deep pit, roared defiantly, "Go to hell!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, a pair of iron arms shot out, and an ancient vine tightened around Arturo's legs, ensnaring him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A cold surge of fear washed over Arturo as he shouted in rage, thrashing his legs with all his might.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though Alexander's bones crackled, and blood poured from his mouth, his arms remained steadfast, unwavering.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Arturo came to a sudden halt, his serpent-like eyes wide with confusion and disbelief as he stared at Alexander. Blood gushed from his mouth as he noticed the sharp tip of the sword protruding from his left chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His heart shattered, blood mixed with silver spurted forth, and darkness enveloped him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From the depths of the pit, Alexander gazed upon Arturo, now slumped on the ground, his eyes shining with a mix of satisfaction, joy, relief, and fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thoughts of the child in the steamer and the deranged woman in the cellar brought him a strange sense of comfort.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander!" Isolde rushed over, embracing him in the pit and weeping openly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Greetings, Your Highness," Zain said, awkwardly bowing with a green steel sword in hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isolde ignored him, clutching Alexander tightly as she cried, "You can't die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander looked at Zain, who appeared slightly different from his television persona, and patted Isolde's shoulder, his eyes filled with complexity. "Your Highness, I can't die yet. Please, let me go for now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Relief washed over Isolde as she looked up and realized he was still alive. However, her gaze shifted to Zain, who stood by watching, and her cheeks flushed with embarrassment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, a voice called from outside the cave, "Hurry up! Mr. Burkart has been..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Risunese, including Raylan, turned and fled. With all level-four warriors down, escape was their only option.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your Highness, I'll go capture the Risunese!" Zain announced, picking up his sword and dashing after them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gently, Alexander brushed his fingers through Isolde's disheveled black hair and asked softly, "Are you really a princess?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah," Isolde replied, her face reddening further.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I see." Alexander awkwardly rubbed the back of his head, took out a Docpirin from his pocket, opened the bottle, swallowed a pill, then sat cross-legged with his eyes half-closed to heal his wounds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Alexander finally opened his eyes, he found Logan and several constables standing guard, with Raylan tied up beside him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Logan cautiously inquired, "Alexander, are you okay?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander playfully punched Logan and laughed, "You're fine, so of course, I am!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite sustaining injuries during his fierce battle with Arturo, thanks to the magical properties of his chest and the healing pills, he had recovered well, save for a few broken ribs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He scanned the surroundings but didn't see Isolde.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Logan chuckled, "Looking for someone? Mr. Dunne was worried about another incident, so he took Princess Isolde back to the palace first! You already hooked up with her? Good for you! If it weren't for Mr. Dunne's assurance you'd be fine, Princess Isolde wouldn't have wanted to leave."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Screw you," Alexander said, shoving Logan playfully as he made his way out of the cave. He spotted several figures emerging from the mountain, and a wave of mixed emotions washed over him. Was this what it felt like to miss someone?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As if sensing his gaze, Isolde turned back, sighed, and began to sing softly, "After we parted, I recall our meeting. I have been with you in my dreams many times..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Logan put his arm around Alexander's shoulders. "Don't worry. Alexander. You will get her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander sighed, "Things are complicated in the palace. Besides, I'm just a commoner. I don't know if we'll meet again."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Logan laughed heartily, "Love really makes people foolish! Once you become a level-five warrior, you could be the Marshal. Are you still worried about winning over Princess Isolde?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander clenched his fists, determination sparking in his eyes as a smile slowly spread across his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the distance, Ruben called out, "Logan, Alexander, hurry! We need to get to Walgus Church and search for the remaining Risunese!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With renewed spirit, Alexander joined the others, escorting Raylan toward Walgus Church.</span></p><div class="pagination">
