  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander couldn't let Frieza destroy the Hrodvik camp. The only way was to escape and lure Frieza away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Frieza snorted coldly, "Unappreciative wretch!" His large, triangular, slanting eyes suddenly turned scarlet. Two dazzling scarlet flames shot out from his eyes, tracing two arcs and instantly chasing after Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander heard a deafening sound behind him. An incredibly scorching flame was approaching. Before he could react, his back felt a slight burning sensation, and two mug-sized scarlet flames burst through his chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blood stained the emerald pendant of his necklace on his chest. The milky-white pendant emitted a faint white light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Being abruptly pierced through the chest and back by Frieza's flames, Alexander's body jolted. He plummeted downward. In an instant, he took out a bottle of Docpirin and poured it into his mouth. Three extremely fury and cool internal energy rushed down his throat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the face of life and death, the mysterious golden energy went into a frenzy. An unprecedented massive amount of scorching warmth filled his body. In an instant, his fighting spirit boiled over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A surge of silver-white flame burst out from Alexander's feet. He roared, "Shifting Stars!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a split second, he kept shifting, rushing towards the top of Frieza's head like a crossbow bolt. His steps were strange, seemingly slow but actually fast.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your combat power reached 4,700. It has increased. But I don't even need to dodge," Frieza laughed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, Alexander appeared above Frieza's head. The warm current from the mysterious golden energy rushed into the Black Iron Ring. The ring shone with dazzling golden light, and the sound of dragon roars filled the air. Extremely tiny and distinguishable mysterious golden runes on the ring lit up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander clenched his right fist and punched Frieza's cheek.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ugh! You are in Divine Transformation State..." Before Frieza could finish speaking, his cheek was caved in. His triangular eyes bulged, and he was sent flying hundreds of feet by the punch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander shot out a silver-white flame from his feet. A huge air wave tore through the sky as he chased after the flying Frieza.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Seismic Cleave!" Alexander howled. His muscles swelled, and the sounds of wind and thunder filled the air. Dazzling blue-and-silver palm shadows appeared in the mid-air, interspersed with dots of gold. They crashed towards Frieza like a category-12 typhoon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The explosive sound filled the air. Dots of light appeared, surrounding Frieza like an inescapable net. Bangs resounded one after another. The dazzling light explosions became more and more dense and huge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A figure wrapped in blue-silver flames shot out from the light explosion and instantly reached above Frieza's head. A fierce roar sounded, "Energy Plot Attack!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A huge, dazzling silver-white light column burst out from between Alexander's palms and instantly hit Frieza.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A deafening sound followed, and a huge, dazzling light explosion appeared, with billowing blue smoke.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander took out the Immortal Trapping Ring from the Space Bag and recited the six-character mantra for subduing demons.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, he threw the Immortal Trapping Ring toward Frieza, and the ring disappeared in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The chants filled the air. A ring composed of huge, mysterious golden characters pressed down towards the position where Frieza was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These characters kept shooting out from the ring, and a series of deafening explosions sounded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, a blue-silver flame burst out from Alexander's feet. Without looking back, he rushed towards the north.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander thought, "Frieza's internal energy didn't weaken at all. His strength is really terrifying." If it wasn't for the golden energy, I would already be dead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My combat power should barely reach the threshold of a level-five warrior, but my body is under a great burden. My muscles are sore and swollen, and I feel my bones are about to break.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If I use the Black Iron Ring to attack... According to what Frieza showed, he should be in the Divine Transformation State..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nearly 100 miles north of the Hrodvik camp, on the open field, a beam of lightning was galloping. Suddenly, it stopped. It was a white steed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The steed was snow-white without a single stray hair. Its long mane fluttered in the wind. On its forehead was a spiral-shaped silver-white long horn, with occasional electric arcs flickering. It seemed to be the legendary unicorn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A girl with a curvy figure was riding on a steed. She was a foreign girl in her teens, with long light golden hair flying in the wind. She has white skin, a delicate face, slender eyebrows, light blue eyes, a straight nose, and coral lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She wore a light-colored linen tube dress. It might be more accurate to say that it was a large piece of linen draped over her graceful figure. Around her beautiful neck was a silver-white cross necklace. Her lean legs tightly clamped the steed's belly, and she held the reins in her hand.</span></p><div class="pagination">
