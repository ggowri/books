  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander planned to make amulets with gems to guard against revenge from City of Sorcery and the Mafia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He felt that the revenge of City of Sorcery would be even more violent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Alexander didn't care at all. The City of Sorcery brought it on itself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, City of Sorcery and Felix had joined forces to build a magic circle on Treasure Island. Alexander would never let them go.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's current strength was much greater than before. He could make more than a dozen good amulets at a time, which could defend against witchcraft attacks within a certain range.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He picked out a suitable gem, took out a carving knife, and began to make the amulet, not worrying about running out of the Force at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Two hours later, Alexander finally completed the twelve amulets.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He breathed a sigh of relief. With these amulets, the important people around him would be protected.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In fact, he still had some of the Force left. But Alexander was not going to use it all up just in case.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander put away the gemstone and said, "Come in!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Betty walked in gracefully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had been waiting outside for a long time. She wanted to report the recent situation of the Ultimate Alliance and throw herself into Alexander's arms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Betty was wearing a tight white shirt, a black miniskirt, and stockings, looking sexy and charming.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You've been so busy that it's hard for me to see you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Betty teased him in a coquettish voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She knew Alexander's temper and that he would not get angry about such a joke.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What was more, Alexander had never paid much attention to the Ultimate Alliance. She had been in charge of it and was exhausted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander chuckled. He really didn't care about the Ultimate Alliance. He travelled a lot and spent a lot of time with women.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Betty hadn't been so capable and taken care of all matters herself, the Ultimate Alliance would have been in chaos.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smiled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Betty, you are my woman. Isn't it your duty to help me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Betty was immediately delighted and no longer had any complaints.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She said, "Oh, I wronged you. The alliance has been developing very well recently. Here are all the accounts, including magic powders, as well as bars, casinos, entertainment, etc. The total profit this month is more than 5.6 billion dollars!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she reported, she respectfully handed over the account book.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Betty didn't dare to show any disrespect to Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, Alexander had already controlled her mental consciousness. In Betty's mind, Alexander was more important than her own life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So much?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was surprised.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Betty smiled charmingly and </span><span>said</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Seventy percent of the profits come from magic powder. Magic powder have become popular all over the world. According to the model prediction, the profits of it will triple in a year."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was satisfied. One year later, magic powder alone could bring him hundreds of billions of dollars in profits.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Add to that the beauty creams, the entertainment industry, and </span><span>Mandale</span><span> Town's income, and it wouldn't be long before he was considered the richest man in the world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said, "Forget about the accounts. I trust you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander threw the account book aside and hooked his finger at Betty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come here. Kneel down!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Betty gave Alexander a coquettish look, then knelt obediently in front of Alexander, and excitedly unzipped his pants.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander did not take a shower after having sex with Ava. A unique smell full of hormones and a slightly fishy taste hit Betty in the face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Betty did not show any disdain but lowered her head in excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander leaned back in his chair comfortably, enjoying the moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Ultimate Alliance had become the largest gang in </span><span>Loscity</span><span>. Betty was like a goddess that many people could only look up to and worship.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If they saw Betty serving a man like a slave, they would be shocked.</span></p><div class="pagination">
