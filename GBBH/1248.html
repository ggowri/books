  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Mutated Monkey King let out a pained roar, rolling on the ground in agony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While Alexander's shot hadn't blown its head apart, the bullet had lodged itself deep in its skull, blood gushing forth like a burst dam.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This shot had merely slowed the beast's relentless assault.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a few agonizing rolls, the Mutated Monkey King got back on its feet, charging towards the wall once more, though noticeably slower&mdash;a clear sign of its injuries.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander sucked in a sharp breath, contemplating how if that armor-piercing bullet, enhanced by the Force, had hit him squarely in the head, he likely wouldn't have survived the impact either.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet somehow, the Mutated Monkey King was still on its feet, shrugging off the pain even as flaming beasts collided with it, sent flying with a swipe of its gigantic paw.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Miraculously, the flames that licked at its fiery red fur failed to ignite; it was as if the hairs possessed some sort of fire-resistant property.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the monstrous beast drew nearer, Alexander's view sharpened. He could see that the impact of the bullet had torn away half of the flesh on its head, exposing a glistening, white skull beneath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A crack ran along the skull where the deformed bullet lay trapped, blood flowing ceaselessly from the wound.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite the severe damage, the Mutated Monkey King wasn't out of the fight; the injuries were significant, but not enough to cripple or kill it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It rallied its strength, charging ahead while howling orders to the surrounding mutated beasts, persistently pushing forward against the barrage of gunfire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Take it down!" Alexander commanded, his finger pointing at the beast.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, the Mutated Monkey King was now only three to four hundred yards away from the makeshift walls, making it easy for everyone to see the dangerous creature up close.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Augusta, William, and Logan, their expressions set with determination, focused their heavy weapons on the monstrous beast.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With synchronized precision, three heavy machine guns erupted in a torrent of fury, unleashing a deadly stream of fire upon the Mutated Monkey King, enveloping it in a relentless barrage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, they weren't wasting regular rounds; they unleashed high-explosive ammunition.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The king was facing a firestorm it couldn't withstand. Most of the explosives hit home, blasting into it with devastating effect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Earlier, the creature had successfully blocked Alexander's sniper round, but now the conditions were far more favorable&mdash;closer range, and the shots were aimed at its chest and limbs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even for a beast like the Mutated Monkey King, its torso was a vulnerable target; bones and muscles there were surely less resilient, especially with vital organs lying beneath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blood erupted from its </span><span>body,</span><span> a gruesome display of shattered flesh as countless new wounds emerged.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The once-mighty beast had lost much of its earlier ferocity; even its arms, thick as tree trunks, now bore gaping holes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Its legs, resembling sturdy trunks, were nearly shattered, chaos erupting as blood poured out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The trio didn't relent; Alexander continued to join in with his sniper fire, creating gaping, bowl-sized holes in the king's body, leaving a gruesome scene of mangled bones and ruptured organs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The insides exploded outward, splashing grotesquely on the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With one final, anguished howl, the Mutated Monkey King collapsed, struggling helplessly as it writhed on the ground. No matter its strength, it could no longer rise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With its legs shattered, it was left in a state of utter defeat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The surrounding mutated beasts observed the situation in shock, quickly descending </span><span>into chaos and scattering in all directions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Norah, who had been anxiously watching the battlefield, finally exhaled deeply.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the Mutated Monkey King eliminated, breaking the horde would become significantly easier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The battle had been nothing short of breathtaking; she hadn't dared to blink an eye throughout the harrowing encounter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The power of the Mutated Monkey King was truly terrifying; had it been up to the people of </span><span>Louvian</span><span> Port alone, they would have been utterly overwhelmed, their defenses shattered, with no escape in sight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the group reveled in their brief moment of triumph, a series of guttural roars echoed from the distance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The chaotic mutated beasts, which had just begun to scatter, suddenly turned and charged straight back towards </span><span>Louvian</span><span> Port.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's face darkened. He could see clearly, over a thousand yards away, a dozen towering figures emerging, each as burly as the Mutated Monkey King himself. It was a pack of mutated red-haired orangutans.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it!" Alexander cursed under his breath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What the hell? Where did these ape freaks come from?" William spat out, his voice dripping with venom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shut up and take them down!" Alexander snarled, his sniper rifle already firing in rapid succession, each armor-piercing bullet aimed directly at the oncoming orangutans.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Augusta and the others didn't hesitate either, each targeting their own foes, unleashing a barrage of firepower.</span></p><div class="pagination">
