  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava was nearly in tears. Over time, she and Ashley had grown close, forming a bond that now made her heart ache with worry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the other end of the phone, a faint, trembling voice made Alexander's hand shake. "Cough, cough... Betty, are you talking to my dad?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Ashley!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the voice, once bright and cheerful, was now feeble and weak, a sound that cut Alexander's heart like a knife.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Betty's voice was choked with emotion. "Ashley, sweetheart, you just rest. Daddy will be back soon!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ashley's soft voice came through, barely audible. "I'm fine. Dad has important things to do... tell him not to worry... cough, cough... let him finish what he needs to... then he can come see me..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A violent fit of coughing came from the other end, so intense it seemed as though she might cough up her very breath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tears streamed down Alexander's face. His little girl was too understanding, her words only deepening his pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Please, Betty, don't let Daddy know... he'll worry too much... cough, cough..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ashley's voice weakened, and another fit of coughing overtook her. Her condition was clearly worsening.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Betty's voice trembled as she said, "Ashley, hold on. Your daddy is going to save you. Just hold on!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Cough, cough... Daddy... Daddy, if I don't make it, don't be sad... I love you..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ashley, how are you? Oh no! She's coughing up blood! Doctor! Doctor!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Betty's frantic screams echoed, then the call was cut off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander felt as though his heart were being torn apart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn that Red Umbrella Group... and damn Felix!" he muttered, gritting his teeth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For a man who never let his emotions show, his face was now a mask of regret and </span><span>sorrow, his tears mingling with his anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With fury burning in his eyes, he grabbed his phone and called Alice, roaring. "Now! Send the fastest helicopter to pick me up!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moments later, a helicopter approached, hovering near the highway.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander abandoned his car, holding Ava tightly as he sprinted toward the helicopter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With one arm around Ava and the other gripping the helicopter's hanging ladder, he swiftly climbed up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The helicopter turned in the direction of </span><span>Loscity</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a hospital in </span><span>Loscity</span><span>, someone was shouting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Out of the way! What are you doing in that operating room?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Betty, flanked by Logan, Marvin, and several members of the Ultimate Alliance, charged forward, desperately trying to force their way through. However, they were stopped by a group of men in black, who blocked them with unyielding force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The lead men in black were level-one metahumans, gifted with special abilities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Logan and Marvin were fighting under immense pressure, only managing to hold their ground thanks to Rosalia's covert support.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The bald leader sneered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>So</span><span> you thought you could take on the Red Umbrella Group? You're in over your heads. That kid is nothing but research material for us!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Another man in black joined in, taunting. "That kid's done for. You're no match for us. Is dying for Alexander really worth it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marvin roared in anger, "Damn you! Metahuman or not, I'll take you down!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He summoned every ounce of his strength, his body swelling and muscles surging with power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Standing over six-five feet tall now, his frame looked like it was chiseled from solid rock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The bald man's face shifted. "He's close to becoming a level-one power type metahuman... We can't let him fully transform!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill them!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The bald leader roared, his fist hurtling toward Marvin's head, crackling with an electric arc&mdash;a rare and deadly lightning ability.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The punch came with terrifying speed, catching even Rosalia off guard due to the distance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marvin barely had time to react as the massive fist closed in on him, the air around it charged with lethal force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then&mdash;suddenly&mdash;a formidable aura descended upon them, accompanied by a thunderous crash that shattered every window in the hospital.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The bald man's body trembled in shock, his punch slowing just enough for Marvin to dodge it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone froze, turning toward the source of the explosion, their faces filled with shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A helicopter hovered above them, and, in the blink of an eye, a figure descended like lightning to the ground before them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His hair whipped in the wind, his presence commanding and awe-inspiring, as he </span><span>gazed down upon them all with a look of quiet contempt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marvin and the others were overjoyed&mdash;Alexander had returned!</span></p><div class="pagination">
