Do you often give women massages?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy couldn't help but ask.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smiled slightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What? Are you jealous?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy blushed and said, "I have no right to be jealous, I just feel that being touched by you is much more comfortable than me touching myself."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander couldn't help laughing out loud.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If a woman felt more comfortable touching herself than touched by a man, then what </span><span>was the role of men?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked at Nancy, who had a coquettish look on her face and pressed her legs together, and his heart was burning with desire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry, if the Kaylon Pill can save my daughter, I will share the formula of the potion and beauty ointment with you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander made a solemn promise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Really? That's a lot of money.
