"We stand at the threshold of battle, defending our homeland, our families, and everything we hold dear..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inside the tent, Fermin and Sellers were trembling, their eyes filled with tears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Early the next morning, among the 500 thousand Hrodvik army, 420 thousand soldiers followed Fermin to retreat. As long as they could reach the medium-sized Teleportation Plate, which was set up in the forest 60 miles east of Hero Gorge, they could be teleported to a place 15 miles outside Campbell and get out of danger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander thought carefully. It would take the army a whole day to reach the forest 60 miles away. He had to defend the camp for at least half a day to ensure the safety of the army. But those Risunese would...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the top of the cliff of Hero Gorge, Frieza looked distantly at the Hrodvik camp and sneered, "They want to retreat? No way!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A dwarf named Galo Neville said respectfully, "Mr. Mank, the other members of Hell Force have other tasks, so leave the task to me. I can wipe them all out."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Frieza glanced at Galo and sneered, "Galo, you rushed here in a hurry. Well, it's your chance to make a deed!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Galo was delighted and shouted in a hoarse voice, "Let's pursue the Hrodvik army!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the deep mountains on both sides of Hero Gorge, 600 thousand Risunese ran in the valley and swarmed towards the Hrodvik camp like ants, as if it were a delicious cake, but they didn't know it was a hard rock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Should I go after the main force of the Hrodvik army? Since they're retreating, Fermin must be there. I just don't know if he still has that mysterious golden bead." Frieza watched the Risunese desperately charging forward and felt excited,</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Frieza made up his mind to pick the easier target first. The strike that Fermin hadn't released a few nights ago had left an indelible impression on Frieza.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The camp wall was built with huge logs and stones. It was about 20 feet high and 6.5 feet wide, with parapets and arrow slits. The camp wall was piled with logs, stones, arrows, pots of feces water, and other defensive tools.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sun seemed to have hidden somewhere, and the sky was gray.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the Hrodvik camp, the 80 thousand Hrodvik soldiers included martial arts masters and strong men. Some had already married, and some were still young. There were fathers and sons, and brothers in arms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They knew they would probably die there, but none of them flinched. They just clenched the swords, spears, halberds, and other weapons in their hands with expressionless faces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They stared at these approaching enemies over the mountains. The atmosphere was deathly silent and extremely depressing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rankin Cahill, a soldier from the crossbow battalion, stood on the camp wall, tightly gripping the powerful crossbow in his hands. There was a hint of nervousness on his young face. There were so many Risunese, all over the mountains and plains, but they were devils. They even killed babies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Risunese's strange cries could be faintly heard. But the general hadn't given the order to shoot arrows yet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rankin thought, "I don't know if I can go back. Dad, Mom, and the girl next door... They must all be waiting for me to go home."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"String the bows!" Suddenly, a roar was heard. Rankin immediately and skillfully loaded an iron-feathered arrow into the powerful crossbow. The arrow was two feet long, with a diamond-shaped head, shining coldly. He raised the crossbow with both hands and aimed at the foremost Risunese.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Enoch, with a burly figure, held a single-horned lance, and his voice was loud. "Steady! Eight hundred paces. Hold on! Five hundred paces. Shoot!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Countless arrows shot up into the air, traversed the sky, and then plummeted down like a violent storm. The parabolas brought up sprays of blood, accompanied by the continuous miserable screams from the Risunese.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Enoch shouted, "Four hundred steps. Shoot! Two hundred paces. Free shoot!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rankin secretly glanced at the young generals. They seemed to be about the same age as him. They were resolute, firm, and calm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rankin was already very familiar with the crossbow in his hands from daily drills. One iron arrow after another whistled out. Seeing those damned Risunese scream and fall, he felt delighted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The number of Risunese corpses under the camp wall was increasing. The crossbowmen's arms began to feel stiff and numb, and the speed of shooting arrows was getting slower.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>There were too many Risunese, swarming forward desperately. They were already approaching the camp wall. The first ladder had been leaned against the wall, and a Risunese had started climbing the ladder.</span></p><div class="pagination">
