  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Keith </span><span>told </span><span>Alexander</span><span> about </span><span>the entire process of acquiring the Sakra Society members' information</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was surprised.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No wonder Norma couldn't find her sister. </span><span>That girl</span><span> already left Risun. Keith, you've done a great </span><span>job this time</span><span>!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"With this information on Sakra Society members, I can track them all down and eliminate them, </span><span>including </span><span>Yinson</span><span>!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well done, Keith. </span><span>Thanks for your hard work</span><span>!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After praising him, Alexander suddenly </span><span>frowned</span><span> and quickly warned him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Keith, </span><span>oh no! Y</span><span>ou've underestimated them. You need to leave your place immediately."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's going on, Mr. Hawthorne? I was careful, and all traces were </span><span>wiped out</span><span>. They won't find anything on me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Keith still didn't quite trust Alexander's judgment, thinking he had </span><span>done it perfectly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Keith, think about it. Since Decker loved</span><span> </span><span>secretly film</span><span>ing so much</span><span>, with all those videos of female teachers and students, he must have installed cameras in his office, too.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And all the </span><span>s</span><span>urveillance footage may have already been uploaded to the cloud. Soon, Sakra Society will </span><span>hunt </span><span>you</span><span>!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get out of there, head to </span><span>the </span><span>Dragon Gang, and find Norma</span><span>! </span><span>She'll protect you</span><span>!</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Alexander could finish</span><span> his words</span><span>, there was a loud crash from outside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, Paula's shrill scream echoed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah! What do you want...</span><span>? </span><span>Master, </span><span>escape</span><span>! They're here!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Keith, run!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula's desperate shouts were followed by the sound of a struggle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You </span><span>bitch</span><span>, you killed Mr. Payne! You're dead!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A man's furious shout rang out, followed by Paula's blood-curdling scream, then... silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Keith quickly ended the call, shoved the USB drive into his pocket, locked the door</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And then he </span><span>used heavy furniture, his desk, chair, and other items to </span><span>block</span><span> the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wouldn't hold for long, but it would slow them down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew that Sakra Society's killers were ruthless. If they caught him, </span><span>he would totally die</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But if he could make it to Dragon Gang's turf, he'd be safe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Right now, with the Sakra Society under pressure, their power was nothing compared to the Dragon Gang's.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Alexander had already contacted Norma and sent someone to help Keith.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Outside, Keith could hear hurried footsteps getting closer. He was panicking, unsure where to run or where to hide.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Someone kicked the door from outside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Fuck! </span><span>Open the door! You can't escape!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The violent pounding on the door and the shouts made Keith even more anxious and frantic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could hear that there were several people outside</span><span>. A</span><span>nd he knew</span><span>, </span><span>if they broke</span><span> in</span><span>, it </span><span>would be</span><span> over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those men kicked the door </span><span>hard </span><span>again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thankfully, the door was solid wood, sturdy enough to resist for a little while, especially with the desk and cabinets behind it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Keith panicked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was the sixth floor. If he jumped</span><span> off</span><span>, he'd definitely die.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had nowhere to run, only able to stare at the door, waiting for his </span><span>death</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The men from outside kicked the door again and again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The door was cracking now, the desk and cabinets shaking, barely holding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A few more hits, and they'd be in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Keith imagined the gruesome outcome. He felt he would probably end in a way worse than Decker.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can't die! I just started enjoying </span><span>my </span><span>life!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grinding his teeth, Keith made up his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He felt that, no matter what, he couldn't stay in the room. Even if he fell, there was a small chance of survival.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Keith quickly opened the window and, shivering, climbed onto the ledge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The ledge was only wide enough for a palm to fit. It was just enough for a person to stand if they pressed tightly against the wall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, it was his only chance at survival.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He spread his arms out, his body sticking to the wall, moving slowly, making sure he wouldn't fall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sweat poured down his face, the wind making his body feel light like he might slip at any moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He reminded himself not to look down, moving with stiff, awkward motions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was only five or six steps to the next window, but to Keith, it felt like an eternity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, he was just one step away, but his body felt like it was no longer responding to his commands. Every movement was a struggle for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And now, he had to step onto the next ledge, but without his hand gripping the wall, the friction would lessen, and he could easily fall.</span></p><div class="pagination">
