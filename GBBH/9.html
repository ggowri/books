  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Get lost!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With a single slap, Alexander sent Ryan sprawling to the ground, mocking him as he did so.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Now do you see who the real worthless one is?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Everyone stood in stunned silence. Alexander's boldness was shocking.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ryan scrambled back to his feet, his face contorted with rage.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Alexander, I'll have you thrown out of Loscity!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He turned to the crowd, roaring, "Everyone, he's just my wife's pathetic ex, a disgusting lapdog!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Please, for my sake, let's all blacklist Alexander and make sure he can't survive in Loscity. Once I become Vice President of the Saint Group, I'll be sure to repay all of you handsomely!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">There was a brief silence before a middle-aged man in a suit stepped forward.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'm the president of the Loscity Courier Association. From now on, Alexander won't receive any deliveries in Loscity."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A rotund man smirked and added, "Mr. Hawkins, I can have Alexander's water and electricity cut off at his home!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Another man joined in, "Mr. Hawkins, I'll make sure Alexander is blacklisted from employment in the city. He won't be able to find a job anywhere!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The crowd eagerly followed suit.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The combined influence of everyone in the room was far greater than the sum of its parts. They could absolutely make life impossible for someone in Loscity.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Alexander, you're done! You're blacklisted in Loscity. Now do you see my power?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ryan laughed maniacally, which inadvertently aggravated his facial wounds, causing him to wince in pain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava had had enough. Seeing so many people gang up on Alexander infuriated her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You're all going too far! What gives you the right to bully someone like this!?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jane looked at Ava as if she were an idiot and said smugly, "What right? The fact that we have money and power. And my man is going to be the Vice President of the Saint Group!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander, seething with anger, laughed in disbelief.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"How about we make a bet, you won't get that Vice President position."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ryan didn't hesitate to agree.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Fine! Let's bet. If I get the position, you'll kneel, apologize, and then leave Loscity forever!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander nodded calmly. "Deal. But if I win, you'll wish you were dead."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With that, he wrapped an arm around Ava's waist and walked out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At the upcoming ball, he would publicly humiliate Jane and Ryan and make the Hawkins family crumble.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jane slammed the table in a fury.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Bastard! You worthless piece of trash, just get out of here!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Back in the car, Ava glanced at Alexander, clearly intrigued.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You don't seem too angry. Have you really stopped loving Jane?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander looked at her and smiled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"With a beauty like you by my side, what's there to be mad about?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava blushed, pulling her arm away from him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Yet, her chest still held the warmth of him, and thinking of the Godfather's arrangement, she couldn't help but feel a strange sweetness in her heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You don't have anywhere to stay now. How about I find you a place?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander joked, "Isn't it a bit soon for us to move in together?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Who said anything about living together? Don't flatter yourself."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava's face turned even redder with embarrassment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The driver and Emma exchanged surprised glances in the rearview mirror. Ava's bashful expression was something they had never seen before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Half an hour later, Ava dropped Alexander off in an upscale neighborhood.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As Alexander stepped out and took in the beautiful scenery and luxurious mansions, he was stunned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Is this... Bevery Hills? You're letting me stay here?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Bevery Hills was Loscity's most famous and exclusive neighborhood, with breathtaking views, high-end shopping streets, and extravagant homes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">One could frequently encounter a wealthy tycoon or a major celebrity on the streets. Living here was a dream many could never hope to achieve.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava waved Emma over.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Emma reluctantly approached, looking sour as she gave Alexander the code to the smart lock.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava pointed to a beautiful, classic-style villa and said, "You and your daughter can live here. Consider it compensation for treating my condition."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As the heir to the Godfather and the Saint Group's chairman, Alexander quickly regained his composure.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The Saint Group owned three luxury estates in the area, and he could move into any of them whenever he wanted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Thank you, Ms. Blackburn. I'll make sure to completely cure your angina."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His eyes drifted to Ava's full, enticing chest.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He couldn't help but recall the feel of her soft, supple skin, the perfect shape, and the smoothness of her body. She was nothing like the women who indulged too much in excess.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava shot him a playful glare. "What are you staring at?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Emma and the driver exchanged a glance. They all felt this wasn't scolding and it was flirting.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Ms. Blackburn, you're a very kind woman. I promise I'll repay your kindness."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander's expression was serious.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava laughed happily. "Silly, just take care of yourself and your daughter first. Call me if you need anything.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I have other matters to attend to. I'll be going now."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava waved goodbye, got into her car, and left.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander watched her drive away, a faint smile tugging at his lips.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Interesting... She's the CEO of the Saint Group. Doesn't that make her my direct subordinate?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As dusk settled over the city and the lights came on, Ava attended a grand evening gala. The attendees were Loscity's elite, wealthy moguls, stars, the mayor, senators, and even the police chief.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She swirled her glass of red wine absentmindedly, her gaze distant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Emma, noticing her distraction, couldn't help but ask, "Ms. Blackburn, have you fallen for Alexander?"</p><div class="pagination">
