  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava thought for a moment and said, "I'll reach out to Mr. Wallace and Mr. Thompson. They should be able to acquire a batch of military-grade weapons."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Very well. Be cautious and keep in touch. Rest assured, I'll return soon."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander replied as he got out of bed, leaving the bedroom to arrange for a private jet to head to Mandale Town at the fastest speed possible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, Alexander was traveling alone, without any of his subordinates.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had absolute confidence in his own strength, and he wasn't truly alone. Mandale Town was still under the control of the Axe and Beverly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a long flight, Alexander finally arrived in Mandale Town.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, you're finally here!" Xavier and Beverly exclaimed with excitement as they saw Alexander step out of the vehicle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their faces were filled with joy and excitement, and their followers looked relieved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander had become a legendary figure in Mandale Town. With his arrival, everyone felt a surge of confidence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Good day, Mr. Hawthorne!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Over a hundred people bowed to Alexander in unison, drawing the shocked and envious gazes of everyone on the street.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who is this young man with such importance?" someone whispered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Keep your voice down. This is a member of the Axe and the McLean family. They're at war with the Mafia. Do you want to die?" another person warned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've heard too. The Mafia has the support of wizards. The Axe has suffered greatly, even their leader, Alyssa, has been captured," someone else added.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Could this young man be the reinforcements the Axe called for? It can't be. He's so young and alone; what ability could he have?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Many speculated, not optimistic about Alexander and the Axe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander went straight to the headquarters of the Axe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Have you found any clues?" he asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Xavier quickly reported, "Alexander, we haven't found any clues yet. What should we do? The longer we wait, the more dangerous it is for Alyssa."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beverly looked at Alexander with affection, bowing her head deeply.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We will assist with everything we have, with just one word from you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her attitude was extremely respectful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She could never forget the last time Alexander had left her in a state of agony and ecstasy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beverly trembled at the memory of those painful and pleasurable events.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, your rescue of the Axe this time was commendable. I will reward you," Alexander complimented her in a flat tone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beverly's face lit up with joy, her cheeks flushing with excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No clues are troublesome. But, it's not entirely hopeless." Alexander commanded, "Take me to Alyssa's room immediately."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, sir!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although the members of the Axe were puzzled about why Alexander wanted to go to Alyssa's room, they dared not ask and did not dare to delay.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They quickly took Alexander to Alyssa's bedroom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Everyone out, guard the door. Without my command, no one is allowed to enter!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander issued the order seriously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one hesitated, immediately retreating and looking at Alexander with some unease.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander activated the Force, using his All-seeing Eyes to scan the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the All-seeing Eyes, the entire room took on a different appearance, as if it were a layered high-definition image.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The base color of the room was black and white, while the footprints, fingerprints, and even the hairs Alyssa had left behind were clearly visible in red through the All-seeing Eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander immediately went over, picked up the fallen hairs, and took out a few sets of lingerie from the wardrobe, sniffing them carefully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Having reached the peak of an Intermediate Warrior, his sense of smell was extremely </span><span>keen, and he had firmly memorized Alyssa's scent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The shape of Alyssa's footprints was also imprinted in Alexander's mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Next, Alexander went to the location where Alyssa was last seen and began a meticulous search.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone was puzzled about what Alexander was doing, but no one dared to disturb him, all waiting quietly for his next move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Found it!" Alexander exclaimed in delight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He sniffed vigorously. Using his All-seeing Eyes to scan the ground, he indeed saw a series of intermittent footprints left by Alyssa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Next to Alyssa's footprints, there were several rows of men's footprints. Those must have belonged to the kidnappers.</span></p><div class="pagination">
