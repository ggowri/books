  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Arturo spat out a mouthful of blood mixed with silver strands. His speed had also increased significantly. It seemed he was not far from stepping into the level-four warrior rank!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By August, the rain had cleared, and the weather was pleasant. Feeling relaxed, Alexander invited Logan to visit Kean Manor for a day of leisure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander had heard from Sellers that the manor originally belonged to Madden, who had gifted it to Julius. Knowing that Rhodes resented him because of Julius, Alexander decided to rename the estate after himself and Logan, calling it&nbsp;Kean Manor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For the past six months, Alexander had barely been involved in managing the manor. Instead, Logan and Vegeta had taken charge of its operations and development.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Still, since it was his own land, Alexander had poured a significant amount of money into it, initially investing&nbsp;300,000 coins.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had spent&nbsp;20,000&nbsp;coins on the&nbsp;Marrow-Cleansing Classic,&nbsp;50,000 coins&nbsp;on a&nbsp;Dimensional pouch, and after various other expenses, only&nbsp;40,000&nbsp;coins remained.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Logan led the way, and before long, they arrived at Kean Manor. It was a prime piece of land, located south of the city and just a dozen miles from the main road.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A carriage ride from there to the heart of Darwin took only a day, and using the&nbsp;relay stations&nbsp;along the main road would make the journey even faster.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kean Manor was surrounded by&nbsp;rolling hills and dense forests, giving it a secluded and peaceful atmosphere. Beside it lay Lotus Lake, a vast body of water stretching for miles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The&nbsp;endless green lotus leaves&nbsp;covered the lake's surface, and the&nbsp;vibrant pink blossoms&nbsp;stood out beautifully in the sunlight. Small fishing boats wove through the water, and in the distance, the melodic chants of fishermen singing could be heard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The area around the manor was filled with&nbsp;lush willow trees,&nbsp;quaint bridges over running streams,&nbsp;natural springs, and&nbsp;fertile farmland. It was truly a&nbsp;land of abundance, a place blessed with&nbsp;rich soil and bountiful harvests.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though Logan had no formal training in manor management, he wasn't completely clueless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He expanded the original manor, enclosing it within a&nbsp;two-mile-long fortified wall&nbsp;made of large&nbsp;stone bricks. All the&nbsp;tenant farmers and workers&nbsp;were moved inside for better security and easier management.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beyond the wall, he had dug a&nbsp;moat. Two yards wide and over a yard deep, filling it with water from the lake.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The high walls were constructed from thick stone bricks, standing about 22 to 26 feet tall and 10 feet wide. Along the top, there were small watchtowers, arrow slits, defensive parapets, alarm bells, and other fortifications. Iron caltrops were embedded along the outer walls to prevent climbing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The main gate was reached by crossing a heavy iron drawbridge, leading to a grand arched doorway made of solid wrought iron.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The massive iron doors were embedded with dozens of large rivets, and above them hung a metal plaque, its engraved characters spelling out: [Kean Manor].</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander inspected the&nbsp;fortifications, moat, and gate, nodding to himself in satisfaction. If any&nbsp;unexpected danger&nbsp;arose, as long as there were enough people inside, even a&nbsp;thousand attackers&nbsp;wouldn't be able to break in easily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the gate, Vegeta and Nova stood waiting with a small group of men. They greeted Alexander warmly before leading him and the others inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The layout looks good!"&nbsp;Alexander remarked as he took in the scenery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The first thing he saw was a&nbsp;training ground, spanning&nbsp;about 328 feet in length and width. Its surface was&nbsp;paved with large bricks, giving it a clean and imposing look. The training field was fully equipped with&nbsp;all eighteen types of weaponry, and several dozen&nbsp;white-robed guards&nbsp;were practicing their combat techniques, their shouts echoing through the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aside from being a&nbsp;military drill area, the training ground also&nbsp;served as a gathering space&nbsp;for the estate's residents. Logan had even&nbsp;added a small fountain, where&nbsp;children were laughing and playing&nbsp;in the water.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beyond the training ground lay the&nbsp;commercial and residential district. There,&nbsp;dozens of three-story buildings&nbsp;stood in perfect rows,&nbsp;built from high-quality pine wood and thick bricks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Various&nbsp;signboards and banners&nbsp;adorned the storefronts, marking them as a&nbsp;restaurant, blacksmith shop, tailor shop, grain mill, brewery, warehouse, and more. The streets bustled with people, creating a&nbsp;lively and prosperous atmosphere.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Logan guided Alexander through the manor, the&nbsp;locals whispered among themselves, bowing respectfully as they passed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That must be the young lord!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He's so young... and so handsome! I like him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander, blessed with&nbsp;sharp hearing, caught every word. A smug sense of satisfaction welled up inside him. He had finally&nbsp;made a name for himself, no longer just another commoner!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the heart of the manor stood a&nbsp;grand estate, its&nbsp;red gates&nbsp;flanked by&nbsp;white stone pillars. The estate was built from&nbsp;birchwood and small bricks, giving it an air of both elegance and strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Above the gate, a&nbsp;large plaque&nbsp;bore the bold calligraphy:&nbsp;[Kean Manor]. Four&nbsp;armed guards&nbsp;stood at attention, gripping&nbsp;long spears, their expressions unwavering.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The group stepped inside and entered the&nbsp;main hall, where they took their seats. Nearby, a&nbsp;young maid&nbsp;quickly served them&nbsp;water.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander burst out laughing.&nbsp;"Didn't expect this! Damn, Logan, you've got some skills!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Logan&nbsp;arched an eyebrow and shot Alexander a side-eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Alexander, you never notice my strengths! Did you know we've got top-quality rice fields outside the estate? Plus, tea plantations, poultry farms, cattle ranches, and stables. The manor brings in nearly&nbsp;10,000 coins&nbsp;in pure profit every year!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
