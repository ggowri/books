  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you still want the bracelet?" Alexander asked with a mocking tone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, I don't want it anymore..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leonard's face turned pale, and he quickly turned to run away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander didn't stop him, simply waving a hand in his direction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A surge of the Force shot out, striking Leonard in the back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leonard paused briefly, sensing something, then quickly checked his back but found nothing amiss before fleeing in a panic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava, puzzled, asked, "Are we just letting him go like that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander chuckled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry, he won't escape my grasp. This is about playing the long game; I want to see if anyone is pulling his strings."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The trace of the Force he had left on Leonard marked him, and with just a thought, Alexander could manipulate it to cause chaos in Leonard's body, making him wish he hadn't run away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Alexander's confidence, Ava felt reassured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They went to a bakery to order a birthday cake and bought gifts before heading home.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Ava opened the door, she found Lynn sitting in the living room, staring blankly at the wall. Upon seeing them, she didn't speak, her expression still frozen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is the Obsidian Core you needed. No need to pay; consider it a gift from me," Lynn said, placing a necklace with an obsidian pendant gently on the coffee table.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's heart leaped at the sight. With the Obsidian Core, he could create the Obsidian Balm, which would fully heal Charlize's burns.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava picked up the necklace and handed it to Alexander, giving him a knowing look. He understood and quietly went upstairs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom, are you still thinking about Victor, that con artist?" Ava asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lynn looked up, forcing a smile. "No, I'm not thinking about him anymore."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava's heart sank at her mother's sorrowful smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What do you think of Alexander?" she asked tentatively.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmm? Why do you ask? He's a good guy, and you two are well matched. I hope you find happiness together," Lynn replied, her gaze curious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava smiled sweetly, "That's good to hear."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her mother's words strengthened her resolve.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Alexander was using the Force to crush the Obsidian Core, mixing it with several herbs to create the Obsidian Balm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had been in </span><span>Tijuanea</span><span> for two days, anxious about Charlize's condition, so he prioritized preparing the balm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he finished, he heard familiar footsteps&mdash;it was Ava returning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alex, I need you to promise me something!" she said seriously, locking her gaze on him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander blinked, puzzled. "What is it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You have to promise first. I assure you it won't harm you! Just say yes, okay?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava cuddled against him, her soft form pressing close.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander sighed, knowing he was susceptible to her charm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, alright, I promise," he relented.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Good! No takebacks! If you go back on your word, you're a puppy, and I won't talk to you anymore," she said excitedly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His curiosity grew.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What exactly is it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I want you to pursue my mom. She has a good impression of you; you could definitely win her over, and then she can forget about Victor," Ava said seriously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wait, what!?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander stared at her in shock. "Do you... do you know what you're saying?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm not crazy, don't worry, I won't blame you, this is for my own good. You... your thing is really too </span><span>strong,</span><span> I can't handle it alone. It would be better to share the load with someone close.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Otherwise, you might get snatched away by Rosalia and the others, and I'd lose out even more."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she spoke, she mischievously reached into his pants, giving him a playful tug.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was at a loss for words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing he hadn't agreed, Ava quickly tried to persuade him, "I'm serious; I'm not joking or testing you. I genuinely mean it. You, the big flirt, like women like my mom, don't you?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You once said that any man would be drawn to her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander rubbed his temples, overwhelmed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This request was completely unexpected.</span></p><div class="pagination">
