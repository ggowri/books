  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander said through gritted teeth, "Those high-ranking officials are unreliable. We must capture Yinson and completely destroy the Immortality Serum as soon as possible."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Otherwise, he will definitely bring a catastrophe to the world."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Betty, pass the word that the Ultimate Alliance is offering a reward of one billion dollars for any information about Yinson."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even if he is hiding in a rat hole, we must find him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, sir!" Betty replied with a serious expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next morning, Alexander and Ava went together to send Ashley to kindergarten.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was school time. In addition to the kindergarten bus, the parking lot was filled with parents' cars.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, someone shouted angrily, "Ashley, stop!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander glanced over and saw a middle-aged couple walking towards them with a fat boy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dressed in a branded suit, the man was half bald and had a large belly, carrying an Herm&egrave;s bag. His remaining hair was meticulously combed and glossy.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The woman who had called out Ashley was heavily made-up and average-looking. Her figure was tolerably good but far inferior to Ava's.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, she was very scantily dressed and of a very different temperament from Ava's sensuality.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ashley, why did you hit my son?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The woman pointed at Ashley fiercely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ashley was so scared that she shed tears and hugged Alexander tightly, sobbing, "I didn't hit him. B-But he always bullies me. He fell down by himself... It wasn't me..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shut up! How dare you deny it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The woman flew into a rage and was about to poke Ashley's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander pushed the woman with his palm, causing her to stagger and flop to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She burst into tears, crying and shouting, "He beat me up. Ashley's father beat me up... She hit my son, and her father attacked me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing his wife fall, the man got angry, rushed forward, and grabbed Alexander by the collar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Alexander could make a move, Charlize, who was following close behind, kicked the man in the stomach.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man tumbled heavily on the ground, covering his stomach and rolling in pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So what if we beat you?" Charlize snorted coldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The woman roared, "You are really ignorant. How dare you beat us? I will teach you a lesson!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She took out her cell phone and dialed a number, wailing, "We have been beaten. Come here right now. Don't you know someone from the Ultimate Alliance? Hurry up and call them over. Otherwise, we will be killed!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ultimate Alliance?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander sneered. He had met Waylon yesterday and the woman today, and both were using the Ultimate Alliance to frighten him. If any member of the alliance really dared to bully others, he would never let them off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, several cars sped over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A group of people rushed out of the car. Waylon and the guys from yesterday were among them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before coming over, Waylon yelled, "Who dared to hit </span><span>my sister</span><span>? I called an executive of the Ultimate Alliance over. Mr. Ulysses is an influential figure in the alliance. No one dares to offend him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smiled. What a coincidence! He didn't expect the woman to be Waylon's sister. It was a great opportunity to deal with Waylon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But surprisingly, Waylon managed to bring Xavier along.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though Alexander figured their only connection must be business - Xavier ran Ultimate Alliance's jewelry division, which probably dealt with Waylon's company.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander gazed at Xavier with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, Xavier, on behalf of the Ultimate Alliance, had occupied a significant share in several important gem-producing areas such as Soutaxia, Gatheolia, and Ameriland.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was in a bad mood with a long face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On his return to Loscity, he was called over by Waylon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it hadn't been for the fact that Waylon had once provided high-quality gems, he would have ignored him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Waylon, you have to avenge us!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The couple hugged Waylon's thighs in tears, pointing at Alexander and scolding, "It is that bastard who beat us."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Xavier and Waylon </span><span>turned to see</span><span> Alexander and exclaimed in astonishment</span><span> at the same time</span><span>.</span></p><div class="pagination">
