  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Trenton had organized his men and was ready to eliminate the members of the Sakra Society.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their base was located in the Riverside Hotel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The members of the Sakra Society were not numerous, but with a lot of financial support behind them, they were quite wealthy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the deep night, several black cars pulled into the underground parking lot of the hotel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were already several armed men waiting. Plenty of women were dragged out of the cars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Disheveled and embarrassed, they embarked on the nightmare of their lives.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hurry up! When you enter this place, there is no chance to go back."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't stand there. Go!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They forced those women into the hotel aggressively.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A middle-aged man approached Cyclops, the rising star of the Sakra Society, and smiled carefully, "Sir, I have arranged a room for you..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cyclops slapped him hard in the face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tell me, how did that bitch Hazel run away? What is going on now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She... All the people we sent didn't come back... The only one who returned soon died. Please forgive me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man desperately begged for mercy, his face as white as paper.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew that Cyclops was formidable, ruthless, and murderous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cyclops snorted, "You are all losers."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He kicked the man to the floor and said, pointing to a young woman, "Bring her over. I need to vent my anger!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She shivered and then screamed miserably, "Don't touch me! Kill me... Kill me right now..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, she couldn't resist. Two burly men grabbed her and took her to Cyclops.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bitch, are you courting death? I asked you to come over, but you still howled to refuse."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cyclops' horrible expression made the woman weep.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as he waved his hand, someone immediately put on her a dog collar and a dog chain as thick as an index finger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The chain made of fine steel was strong and heavy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cyclops held the chain and looked as haughty as if he were walking a dog.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The woman was so ashamed and resentful that she longed to kill the devil in front of her. He deceived her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cyclops could always coax some women into trusting him by virtue of his good looks and sweet words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The woman was once the proprietress of the Riverside Hotel, but she was controlled by Cyclops, and the hotel became his stronghold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was too late for her to make any resistance now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All the women were escorted into the hotel, whose basement had been converted into a modern prison by Cyclops.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The compartments inside were exactly like those in a prison, with 24-hour guards and a monitoring system.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As those women drew nearer, their faces darkened even more, and they couldn't help but shiver violently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They saw a lot of battered women and all kinds of racks and strange instruments of torture. It was like hell.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cyclops ordered coldly, "Put collars and chains on them. I want to give them a warning!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, the women were put on chains one by one, and their clothes were stripped off, leaving them naked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Listen up, you bitches. From now on, you are my property, and you must obey my orders completely!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If anyone dares to disobey, I will break her legs and give her to the tramp on the street.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you understand?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cyclops' gloomy, threatening voice, combined with his fierce subordinates and the terrible torture devices, made the women tremble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They all hung their heads, not daring to make a sound.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cyclops shouted, "Very good. Now, lie down like dogs."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, the proprietress scolded, "You have gone too far! We are all dignified. If you return the hotel to me, I won't call the police."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All the other women glanced up at her with gratitude and sympathy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, they deeply understood that the proprietress was doomed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Fucking</span><span> bitch</span><span>! H</span><span>ow dare you </span><span>talk back to</span><span> me in public and threaten to call the police?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>You </span><span>are seeking death</span><span>! </span><span>Since you don't like being a dog, that's fine</span><span>! </span><span>I'll show you what kind of woman is my good dog," Cyclops laughed grimly, planning to </span><span>torture this bitch to threaten others</span><span>.</span></p><div class="pagination">
