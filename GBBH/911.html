  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander acted swiftly. The rabbit barely had time to lift a claw before he snapped its neck with a sharp twist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was a sharp crack as the rabbit's head flopped down, but it still didn't die. Instead, it became even more vicious, clawing at Alexander with renewed fury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it. This rabbit must have been bitten by a living dead!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander pieced together the rabbit's strange behavior with the bite marks on its leg. He was now certain that it was a zombie rabbit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If the living dead could turn animals into monsters like this, then humans bitten by them were doomed to the same fate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander recalled the recent wave of disappearances in </span><span>Loscityg</span><span>, and it all pointed to Sakra Society's involvement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The rabbit twisted violently, trying to sink its teeth into his hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stay dead, will you?" Alexander growled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a swift motion, he smashed the rabbit against a nearby rock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Its body crumpled under the impact, bones snapping like dry twigs. At last, it went </span><span>limp, motionless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander glanced at the lifeless creature and shook his head. Any thought of eating it was gone. Without wasting time, he took off in the direction of Base One.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This mission wasn't just about rescuing Hazel. It might also uncover the Sakra Society's dark experiments with the living dead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The forest grew thicker, the shadows deeper. The mountains loomed high above, and not a soul was in sight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the closer Alexander got to the base, the more twisted wildlife he encountered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rabbits, wolves, even wild boars and snakes... all turned into fearless zombie beasts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was no mistaking it now. The base was experimenting on animals, and some had clearly escaped, unleashing chaos into the wild.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, Alexander spotted the entrance to Base One.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A group of wild boars was nearby, frantically digging into the dirt with their snouts. They were tearing at the ground with such force it was clear they'd found something.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These weren't normal boars. They were massive, their tusks unnaturally long, gleaming white under the moonlight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander crept closer, his steps silent, trying to see what they were after.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the boars noticed him almost immediately. One by one, their bloodshot eyes locked onto him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With enraged grunts, they charged, their bulk shaking the ground as they closed the distance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander didn't flinch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A flash of silver lit the air as he activated his lightsaber. The boars didn't even have time to scream before they were split cleanly in two.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He approached their kill to see what had them so ravenous, but his stomach turned at the sight. It was a rotting corpse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The body was bloated and blackened, far from anything resembling a normal human.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Scattered nearby were broken bones, remnants of previous victims.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't hard to piece it together. The boars had unearthed the body from shallow soil and feasted on its decaying flesh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These corpses weren't random. They were failed experiments from the base, dumped and buried here like trash.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's expression hardened. This was undoubtedly one of the reasons the animals had mutated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Base One was close now. He clenched his fists, a cold smile tugging at his lips. Hazel would be rescued, and this wretched base would be destroyed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, he just needed to find a way in. The mountain's shadow hid everything in darkness, but Alexander had his x-ray vision.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He quickly scanned the area, relying on the intel provided by Kellen, who had spilled his secrets in exchange for his life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There, at the base of the mountain, a dense patch of shrubs concealed something unusual.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To anyone else, it looked like an ordinary thicket. But Alexander could see it clearly, a cave hidden behind the foliage, its mouth dark and foreboding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inside, the base's steel blast door lay sealed tight, surrounded by electric fences and infrared surveillance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Charging in through the main entrance would only alert the enemy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If this was an underground research facility, there had to be a ventilation system.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a quick search, Alexander found a narrow ventilation shaft hidden under thick underbrush.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The shaft was barely wide enough for a person to squeeze through. A steel grate covered the opening, and the drop inside was pitch-black and endless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander crouched by the entrance, sizing it up. It was tight but manageable. He took a deep breath, channeling his energy to adjust his body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a series of sharp pops, his joints shifted, and his tall frame, normally over six feet, compressed by several inches. His broad shoulders slimmed, his build shrinking just enough to fit.</span></p><div class="pagination">
