  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as they stepped through the gates of the slave market, a group of eager slave traders approached them, each one more attentive than the last.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I have a newly arrived slave who excels at serving!" one of them exclaimed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hello, I'm Caspian Huynh, the guy with the largest selection of slaves!" another chimed in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander cast his gaze upward at the sunset, shaking his head. Despite his thorough search, he could find no one who caught his interest. Reluctantly, he struck an agreement with Caspian, the most prominent slave trader, to notify him immediately if any particularly strong slaves became available.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sellers, sensing the encroaching darkness, playfully tugged at Alexander, saying, "Come on, Alexander, it's getting late! You must be hungry!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a sigh, Alexander replied, "I know you just want to drink again. I'll make sure to get you drunk!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Logan turned back to the slave market, his reluctance evident as he muttered, "Honestly, I think those Risun girls are quite appealing. Didn't Alexander say he wanted to kill demons? I could buy a few..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Four hours later, Sellers and the others were thoroughly intoxicated at the restaurant and were carried home by several servants, still laughing and joking as they departed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander patted Nova on the shoulder, saying, "Well done, my friend!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Embarrassed, Nova scratched his head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Logan chuckled, "Nava, don't forget to grow a mustache! You really should have some facial hair!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After another round of drinks, Alexander set his glass down and asked seriously, "Vegeta, what's your current strength?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vegeta paused for a moment before responding, "On the Noah Continent, I'm considered a third-level trainee knight, which is the equivalent of a peak level-three warrior here in Sahasia. Nova is a level-two warrior."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What skills do you have?" Alexander asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Our tribe lacks martial arts techniques," Vegeta explained. "But we're born with supernatural powers. We survive in the dark realm, fighting monsters and beasts daily to maintain our strength. However, I am the strongest in my tribe! If only we hadn't been defeated by the Noah Empire."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Curious, Alexander asked, "Oh? Is the Noah Empire the most powerful on the continent?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vegeta sighed, "In terms of sheer strength, the Noah Empire pales in comparison to the Holy See. The Knights of the Holy See could crush me easily!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Logan glanced at Vegeta and asked, "What level does a Holy See Knight correspond to in Hrodvik?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Recognizing Logan's power, Vegeta replied respectfully, "A Holy See Knight is a level-five warrior! It's said there's a Bronze Knight above the Holy See Knights."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is a Bronze Knight really that powerful?" Alexander inquired, tapping the table thoughtfully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nova eagerly chimed in, "Legend has it that the Bronze Knight dons the Bronze Cloth, a sacred artifact of the Church. It's said to burn their very life force and soul, making their power immense!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Logan asked, "Is there Silver Cloth and Gold Cloth?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander sighed, "They might wield energy techniques, but they can't possess holy garments!?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though Vegeta didn't fully grasp what Alexander was talking about, he could sense their concern. He had never heard of the Silver Cloth or Gold Cloth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clapping his hands, Alexander said, "Alright! It's not sustainable for your people to remain in the mountains. Here are some coins&mdash;take your people to the Moon Inn for now. If you run low on money, come to me. I'll find a way to help you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you!" Vegeta said, accepting the coins and bowing with Nova.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unbeknownst to Alexander, as Vegeta bowed, a fierce light flickered in his eyes, revealing his inner turmoil at having to submit to Alexander in this situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although he had no territory to his name yet, Alexander's generosity intrigued him, leaving him to wonder about Alexander's true strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Being the master of Vegeta wouldn't be an easy task.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vegeta was inherently proud, never one to accept defeat easily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying their goodbyes to Vegeta and Nova, Alexander and Logan made their way to Dominion Church, parting ways once they arrived. Lost in thought, Alexander strolled slowly toward the outer courtyard, contemplating what a strange world he was in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In Sahasia, there were sects.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the Noah Continent, there was the Holy See, the Sacred Cloth, and the Knights of the Holy See.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And then there were those in Risun with incredible combat skills.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He felt the golden essence within his chest pulse stronger with each heartbeat, a wave of indomitable will rising within him as his heart raced and blood surged.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the guest hall of courtyard No. 509 at Dominion Church, a young man in his twenties sat regally on a large chair in the center of the room. He wore a crown, had thick eyebrows, a prominent nose, and was draped in a silver silk robe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He emanated an intense aura, almost as if he were a blade ready to strike.</span></p><div class="pagination">
