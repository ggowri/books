  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two women, along with fifty elite guards, were the pride of the Morris family&mdash;trained warriors forged through rigorous preparation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Such a formidable defense should have been impenetrable, yet now they lay defeated, their ranks decimated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a shadowy corner, someone trembled, caught in a whirlwind of shock and disbelief, now numb to the horror unfolding before their eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They watched helplessly as master after master from the Morris family fell, unable to even catch a glimpse of the shadowy figure responsible for the carnage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Morris family is really finished this time..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Looks like what was supposed to be a celebration is turning into a funeral!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Guests at a distance murmured among themselves, their initial fear giving way to astonishment, then delighting at the unfolding disaster.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Morris family had bullied them in the past, taking advantage of their goodwill, and yet they had still felt compelled to curry favor with the family by bringing gifts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now that trouble had come knocking at the Morris family's door, they couldn't help but revel in the chaos.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the Morris family's headquarters, Weston's brow was furrowed in deep concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's going on? Why have all four of our camps been wiped out? Where is the Tiger Strike Squad? Why have we lost contact?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Over a hundred elite operatives, meticulously selected, along with the Tiger Strike Squad, represented the best of the Morris family's ranks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet now, they were unreachable, their camps devastated, and there were confirmed reports of an enemy attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Weston was at a loss. "Who could possibly have the audacity to launch such a large-scale assault on the Morris family?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What kind of force would dare to challenge them so brazenly?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each member of the Tiger Strike Squad was equipped with a satellite tracking chip, allowing them to be located even in death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, to Weston's dismay, all signals had vanished!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This can't be happening. Even if their bodies were buried, we should still be able to track them. Over a hundred corpses&mdash;there's no way the enemy had time to dispose of them all. What on earth is going on?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anxiety gnawed at Weston. He was completely unaware that the bodies had been reduced to ash by the Force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Quick! I need to see Mr. Frederick Morris!" he shouted in frustration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Morris family had set up temporary camps in all four cardinal directions, and now they were all destroyed, yet they didn't even know who the enemy was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just the thought sent chills down Weston's spine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, a powerful aura of sword energy seeped through the back courtyard as if a fearsome beast lay in slumber, ready to awaken.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The intensity of this sword energy cast a shadow over the entire Morris Estate, making even those with lesser abilities tremble, instilling a deep-rooted sense of awe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Frederick's martial arts are even stronger than Diego's. He's incredible!" Felix exclaimed, eyes wide as he stared toward the study, his expression grave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, a persistent ringing broke the tense silence. Frederick frowned and picked up his phone, irritation etched across his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moments later, he roared into the receiver, "I command you to get over here, now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, Weston stumbled into the room, collapsing, drenched in sweat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is the information accurate!?" Frederick's icy tone dripped with menace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Frederick Morris, it's... it's absolutely certain. I wouldn't disturb you unless it was an extreme situation!" Weston stammered, his voice quivering.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Tiger Strike Squad has been completely wiped out? Are you sure you're not mistaken?" Frederick shot up, his face turning a shade of thunderous gray.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Tiger Strike Squad was the culmination of twenty years of hard work and countless resources, a powerful organization he had painstakingly built.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Frederick Morris, it's true. Their satellite signals have vanished... It's likely their bodies were burned or thrown into the river..." Weston trembled as he spoke, barely daring to meet Frederick's gaze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Frederick's composure shattered in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew Weston never lied, and the persistent silence from the Tiger Strike Squad spoke volumes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He mused, "All four camps have been wiped out; could the enemy be planning an assault from all sides?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the Northern Mountains, even if every other faction joined forces, they couldn't have taken down all four of our camps.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Who on earth is behind this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Frederick racked his brains but couldn't come up with an answer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get someone out there now to find out what's going on. Don't even think about coming back until you have answers!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And keep this under wraps. If word gets out to our guests, it'll cause a panic. You know the consequences!" Frederick ordered sternly.</span></p><div class="pagination">
