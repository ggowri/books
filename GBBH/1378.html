  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Boom! Boom! Boom!&nbsp;Explosions echoed one after another. Klein's Piercing Wave clashed against Alexander's Seismic Cleave, and for a moment, the two were evenly matched.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Klein sneered inwardly.&nbsp;"I'm in midair. This fight is already mine."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His Seismic Cleave has a wide range, but it can't last forever.&nbsp;With this in mind, Klein gathered even more energy, unleashing a relentless storm of Piercing Wave at Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander felt frustrated. Martial artists could usually detect attacks by sound, but he was blind. With Klein attacking from the air, he was clearly at a disadvantage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His Seismic Cleave was barely holding the fight together, but it wouldn't last. If he wanted to end this quickly, there was only one option...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In just a few moves, Klein saw Alexander's energy suddenly falter. Taking the chance, he fired a Seismic Wave straight through his chest. The impact left a deep crater in the ground, and blood gushed like a fountain. Alexander trembled violently before collapsing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Klein was ecstatic. He had expected a tougher fight, but it ended quicker than he thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He turned his head and saw Adonis locked in an intense battle with Josh. Without hesitation, he pivoted and shot toward Adonis from midair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the moment the Piercing Wave struck, Alexander made a barely perceptible dodge, avoiding a fatal hit to his heart. Now, as he lay on the ground, his golden energy surged through him, filling his body with warmth. The injury was painful but not life-threatening.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had counted on Klein assuming he was dead and rushing off to help Adonis.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Klein turned, Alexander silently sprang from the ground. He sank his weight low, stepped forward like a drawn bow, and twisted his body. His hands hovered at his waist, crackling with dazzling arcs of energy. In an instant, countless silver-white sparks gathered in his palms, forming a radiant sphere of pure light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander roared,&nbsp;"Energy Plot Attack!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The brilliant energy sphere erupted into a blinding silver-white beam, hurtling straight toward Klein in midair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh no!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Klein turned, every hair on his body stood on end. A bone-chilling sensation shot up his spine, straight to his head.&nbsp;Extreme danger!&nbsp;But before he could dodge&mdash;BOOM!&nbsp;Agonizing pain seared through his body. His vision went black. And then... nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adonis heard the explosion and glanced over. Klein was plummeting from the sky, his fate unknown. A chill ran through Adonis' heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gritting his teeth, Adonis made a bold move. His massive body trembled as he charged forward, ignoring the nine-ringed broadsword slicing toward his gut. His tree-trunk-sized arms lunged forward, wrapping around Josh like a helpless child.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Josh felt like he was trapped in an iron vice. His broadsword had sunk deep into Adonis' gut, yet it felt as if he had stabbed into a bottomless pit, meeting no resistance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shocked, he unleashed a surge of crimson protective energy, forming a barrier around himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adonis' face twisted into a savage grin. His massive body seemed to swell even larger. He squeezed Josh with all his might, repeatedly slamming him against his own chest and stomach&mdash;BANG! BANG! BANG!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Josh felt his world spinning. His entire body went numb, his chest and stomach aching with unbearable pain. Blood gushed from his mouth&mdash;if this continued, Adonis would crush him to death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A blue figure shot forward like a bullet, appearing at Adonis' side in an instant. A thunderous crack filled the air as an iron-like arm, powerful as a divine war hammer, slammed into Adonis' ribs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adonis' face turned pale. His massive torso quivered from the impact. In response, he lifted Josh high and hurled him straight at Alexander like a boulder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander felt his powerful energy blast into Adonis' body, only for it to vanish like a stone sinking into the ocean. Suddenly, the sound of something tearing through the air rang out above him&mdash;Josh was hurtling toward him like a massive rock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shocked, Alexander unleashed his full energy. He twisted his body in an impossible motion, executing the&nbsp;Yoga Serpent Stance. In a flash, he appeared behind Adonis. His iron-like arm swung like a battle staff, surging with blue protective energy&mdash;BAM! BAM! BAM!&nbsp;Three consecutive strikes smashed into Adonis' neck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adonis, ever the mighty sumo, casually tossed Josh aside. Then, using his immense bulk, he lunged toward Alexander, slamming into him with full force. His massive hands, as large as palm fans, locked around Alexander's arms in a crushing grip.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His entire body rippled like waves of fat. With a sudden roar, he executed an over-the-shoulder throw, launching Alexander like a cannonball.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander felt as if his arms were caught in iron shackles. Adonis' trembling bulk sent a shockwave through him&mdash;before he knew it, he was airborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Midair, Alexander's palms erupted with a brilliant glow. His fingers curled like dragon claws, and with a&nbsp;Dragon's Fury&nbsp;strike, he latched onto Adonis' topknot from a distance, yanking himself backward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adonis was delighted to have thrown Alexander away and was just about to charge forward for a finishing blow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Suddenly, a blue shadow flashed toward him like lightning. Before he could react, Alexander's foot gently tapped his throat. A burst of blue protective energy erupted&mdash;CRACK!&nbsp;His Adam's apple shattered!</span></p><div class="pagination">
