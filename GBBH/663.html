  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stunned, Beverly smiled sweetly, "Mr. Oldman, it turns out that everything is under your control. Well, I can only rely on your protection."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, she rubbed her plump breasts against Paxton's body a few times.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was not a fool. She seduced him just to secure everything she had.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Overnight, Mandale Town changed drastically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Some people in the Weaver family attacked and ostracized Beverly. In the past few days, the loss of a great number of clients and sales channels had provoked protests from the Weaver family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If things continued like this, they might unite and expel her from the family, even if the Axe did nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She knew that if she lost her position as the head of the Weaver family, her fate would be miserable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A beautiful and wealthy woman was sure to be coveted by everyone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, Beverly would rather die than try to live a life in which she lost power and status and had to lick the boots of others.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, she was determined to protect everything, even if it meant sleeping with someone else.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Paxton sneered, "Beverly, things have already come to this. There's no need for you to hide your trump card anymore. Since we are going to join forces, let's be honest with each other.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I know there is a force supporting you. Otherwise, it wouldn't have been impossible for a woman like you to take over the Weaver family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you show your trump card, I promise to do my best! Let's work together to destroy the Axe, kill Alexander, and share everything in Mandale Town!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paxton stared at Beverly to see her reaction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her sultry expression disappeared, and she fell silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paxton did not interrupt her train of thought but waited quietly.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a while, she said, "Don't worry. I will do my best! But after we destroy the Axe, I will take half of all the interests in Mandale Town, whether it's the mining area, sales channels, or exchanges!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paxton grinned, waved his hand, and said, "Beverly, it's too much for you to ask for half. Remember, now you are not working with me but with the Mafia behind me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In fact, I am aware that you have the support of the people from the City of Sorcery, but we, the Mafia, are not afraid of them! You want to seize half of Mandale Town's interests with just one or two wizards. How dare you!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"At least I'll take 60%, and you get 40%. If you agree, we can officially join forces."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paxton was very firm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beverly sneered, glaring at him, "Men are all heartless. Women are nothing to you after sex.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Paxton, you have no idea how formidable the wizard I support is. As one of the elders of the City of Sorcery, he is mysterious and powerful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you want him to take the shot, I'll take half."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paxton burst into laughter and then insisted, "You came to sleep with me today. I'm a </span><span>normal man. A beauty like you took the initiative to seduce me. Of course, I wouldn't refuse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In the event of our cooperation, I'll take 60%, and you will get 40%. That's the bottom line. This time, the Mafia will be sending out a lot of experts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you are willing to cooperate, you can get 40% of the interest. If not, forget it. Then, the Mafia will sweep across Mandale Town and destroy everything!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paxton's tone was full of murderous intent, and it was an evident threat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beverly's face darkened. If the Mafia were to assign a large number of people to Mandale Town, they would definitely unify the entire town.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that time, everyone, including the Weaver family, would only end in destruction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beverly fell silent for a while again before agreeing through gritted teeth, "Okay. I'll ask the wizard elder I support to help, and you have to fulfill your promise. What do you think?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's a deal!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paxton was overjoyed. After a moment of contemplation, he said, "As the saying goes, the best defense is offense! The Axe is not completely stable yet. Let's fight them tomorrow. Alyssa will definitely not expect our surprise attack."</span></p><div class="pagination">
