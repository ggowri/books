  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy felt an electric sensation, like Alexander was massaging her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander sat on the sofa, waiting quietly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm done washing."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy came out and said sweetly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander turned his head and looked at her with a complicated expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy was the most beautiful woman he had ever seen. Her looks, temperament, and figure were comparable to Ava's.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander secretly reminded himself that Ava was the woman he loved most.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy stroked her chest and said tenderly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your massage is so effective. My breasts feel fuller, and my bra seems to be getting smaller.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How about you help me strengthen the effect? Otherwise, if you go back to Loscity, I can't see you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without waiting for Alexander to answer, she took the initiative to lie down on the sofa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander untied Nancy's bath towel and started massaging directly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her breasts were being pushed around, which were charming.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy hummed excitedly and held Alexander's arm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was like a great painter, painting on the canvas.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His dexterous fingers sometimes slid across the nipples, and sometimes stopped to tease, making Nancy shiver constantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you often give Ava massages like this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy couldn't help but ask.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smiled, "Are you jealous?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy blushed and sighed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I am not so lucky, but I don't want to admit defeat. If one day, Ava can't become your wife anymore, will you think of me first?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander couldn't help but smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Did your family teach you something last night? Otherwise, you wouldn't have come to me in the morning and said that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What are you up to?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander teased her with a wicked smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy said, "What? I just want to give myself to you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander couldn't help but take a deep breath and went forward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, Frederick Morris, the head of the Morris family, was busy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Morris family's power was deeply rooted in the north. They were very efficient.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In front of him, there was a pile of information about Alexander and the Ultimate Alliance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The information is very detailed, even Alexander's birth record was included.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They learned from the Fairfax family about Alexander's years in the Fairfax Villa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A thick pile of papers piled on the desk.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In addition to detailed information about Alexander, there was a computer in front of Frederick. He used special software to input Alexander's information and summarized Alexander's personality traits, strengths and weaknesses, etc.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although the answer might not be accurate or realistic, it gave Frederick a deep understanding of Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From Alexander's rise in Loscity to Felix being forced to come to the Morris family, too many stories happened. Only Alexander himself knew about some of his experiences.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Frederick had been studying Alexander these days and even stayed up for two consecutive nights, immersed in the data and calculations and predictions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, Frederick had discovered an unknown treasure. Faintly, his eyes revealed excitement and bloodthirstiness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander must be hiding a secret, which was the key for the Morris family to improve.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Frederick couldn't imagine how powerful the Morris family would become if he could know this secret.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Frederick wanted to kill Alexander and know this secret!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He quickly ordered, "Call Felix here, now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, sir."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The footsteps faded away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next day, Alexander was busy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ashley's health had stabilized, and she was recovering quickly. Therefore, Alexander decided to take the initiative and not wait any longer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could not allow Felix to collude with the Morris family. They were like hidden wolves. As long as they get a chance, they would jump out and bite Alexander at any time.</span></p><div class="pagination">
