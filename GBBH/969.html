  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Grace originally wanted to object to Asher treating Gavin, but she couldn't say it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Grace, give Alexander a call and ask him to come over in the evening. He will agree."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gavin gave the order confidently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Grace happily agreed, then quickly stood up and went back to her room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She was thinking about Alexander. It was her first time calling him, and she wanted to leave a perfect impression on him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Oh, I like Asher. He's handsome, has a good family background, and is capable."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ave praised loudly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Of course, Gale agreed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He said, "Yeah, I think so. He's a good match for Grace. They can meet in the evening, and maybe they can reconcile."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Grace didn't want to listen to them, so she rushed into the room and slammed the door shut.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander had just finished sex with Rosalia and Charlize when he received a call from Grace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander didn't intend to answer it, but after thinking about it, he finally answered it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Hello, Mr. Alexander? This is Grace. Asher said he can cure my grandfather's injury and wants to have a date with me...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'm holding a birthday party tonight. Please come and help me teach Asher a lesson! It's this guy who wanted to ruin your mother's grave."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Grace spoke quickly, excitedly, and a little incoherently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But her voice was nice and soft.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Asher?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander pondered for a while, then smiled coldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Not only did Asher want to compete with Alexander for the chance to treat Gavin, but most importantly, he wanted to use the grave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander decided to teach him a lesson.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Moreover, Alexander could sense that Grace had a good impression of him and wanted to refuse to be with Asher.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She said, "Mr. Hawthorne, will you come?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Grace didn't hear Alexander's answer and suddenly became anxious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Okay, I've found the medicine for Gavin. See you tonight. I'll teach Asher a lesson..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander was interrupted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Grace cheered excitedly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Great! I knew you would come. You must be more powerful than Asher. Teach him a lesson. I never want to see him again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne, do you want me to pick you up?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Grace asked excitedly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Thank you. I'll go there myself then."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander refused directly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He felt Grace's enthusiasm, but he did not want to date Grace before knowing Gavin's attitude.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If he angered Gavin for a woman, it would definitely not be worth it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Moreover, Alexander deeply understood a truth. All good came at a cost.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He had been enhancing the Force by spending every day with women, and he had already felt some psychological changes. If he continued, he might start to degenerate into a Corrupted Warrior.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Grace said, "Really? Well, please come. You are my most anticipated guest. It will be a great honor for me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Being rejected by Alexander, Grace was not angry at all but was still very excited.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She couldn't help fantasizing about them making love.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Time passed quickly, and it was evening.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The lights in Loscity were just coming on. The night view was charming.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander drove to the Lawson family's manor in Loscity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He saw the parking lot was full of luxury cars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was obvious that all those attending Grace's birthday party tonight were important figures.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although the manor was not very big, it was decorated stylishly, revealing luxury in a low-key manner.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The living room was brightly lit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Many well-dressed and elegant men and women were chatting. There were occasional bursts of laughter in the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Grace stood at the door to welcome the guests, but she stared outside as if she was waiting for someone to arrive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She was dressed very beautifully today, in a white backless evening dress that tightly wrapped her sexy body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The makeup on her already beautiful face made her look even more charming and seductive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing Alexander, Grace couldn't help but smile happily.</span></p><div class="pagination">
