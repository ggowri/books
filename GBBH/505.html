  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The women stood in a line, pushed and prodded into position, with guns pointed at them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their arms were restrained behind their backs, forcing them to lift their chests, accentuating their figures, while the men leered at them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each of them felt a profound sense of humiliation. After all, they had come here to capture Felix, yet they had ended up in the hands of the people from the Red Umbrella Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was tragic and ironic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Vanderbilt, these women are stunning, especially this blonde one," said a man with a buzz cut, trying to win Felix's favor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmm, not bad. This one's got quite a figure. Bet she'd be soft to the touch." Felix grinned lewdly, giving Danielle's chest a firm squeeze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ugh!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Danielle </span><span>spat</span><span> right in Felix's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, feisty little thing, aren't you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix didn't even seem upset; he just smirked, walking around them with a smug expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Boss, after you're done with them, could you spare a couple for us?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, we'd love to enjoy a bit of that soft skin, too," one of the metahumans said, his eyes gleaming as he leered at Danielle and the others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shameless! You're all despicable!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Danielle was trembling with rage, her voice filled with contempt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You've all got bounties on your heads. You won't escape! If you dare touch anyone, I won't let you get away with it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one paid any attention to Danielle's threat; they only rolled their eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Captured by me, and you're still so arrogant? Who cares about a bounty? You're still in my hands."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix glared at Danielle, feeling a fiery rage boiling inside him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A blonde half-blood? Today, I'm going to see what's different about you. Hold her still. I want a closer look!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"On it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At Felix's order, the men snickered wickedly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bastard!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You bitch, let me go!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amidst the women's screams, they were held down, even their tight combat suits being torn apart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their full chests, slim waists, and curvy hips were all on display for everyone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Danielle, in particular, with her shapely curves and blonde hair cascading down, looked incredibly alluring.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wow, now that's a chest!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Not only pretty, but in the nursing stage. There's even milk!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Realizing Danielle was different, they couldn't help themselves and began howling like wolves, eyes filled with desire as if they wanted to pin her down right then and </span><span>there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You </span><span>jerks</span><span>! Just kill me already!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Danielle's eyes showed a trace of panic, her face flushed, but her anger only made her look more captivating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The women were forced to stand in a row, their clothes torn, nearly half-exposed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Led by Felix, the men chattered, making crude comments on their figures, leaving the women in utter shame and fury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hah! Came here for a measly bounty, only to deliver yourselves to me," Felix sneered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though he acted indifferent about the bounty, deep down Felix was under great pressure, his violent tendencies bubbling up, eager for a way to release them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ella had long lost his interest. She was now locked in the basement, a plaything for everyone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix gripped Danielle's chest tightly. It was so large he could barely hold it with one hand, soft and supple, with a faint trace of milk seeping out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah! Let me go..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Danielle screamed, Felix grinned wickedly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get away!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Danielle suddenly kicked out, almost hitting Felix in a vulnerable spot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix managed to dodge, but it startled him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, if she'd hit that spot, he'd be done for.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You wretch, still resisting?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix grabbed Danielle harshly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Someone, spread her legs and cuff them apart!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Danielle's hands were already cuffed behind her back, and now her legs were forced apart and shackled, unable to close.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix reached out, letting his hand roam over Danielle's alluring body, stroking slowly...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Danielle's skin prickled, a chill running over her as though a cold, venomous snake was slithering along her body.</span></p><div class="pagination">
