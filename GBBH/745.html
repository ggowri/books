  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elaine, however, was full of confidence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There's no need to panic. Blaze has already sent the patient samples back. Mr. White still needs us to research the poison, so he won't do anything to us."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only then did Jake breathe a long sigh of relief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elaine pondered for a moment and said, "I have to go back now, Jake. Think carefully about how best to report to Mr. White when we return."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You know the president's temper. If he really gets angry, he might kill you without a second thought. After all, I'm the main force in researching the poison." After saying that, Elaine let out a soft, flirtatious laugh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She swayed her hips and walked away in her high heels.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jake's face was ashen, and he glared fiercely at Elaine's retreating figure, muttering under his breath, "Bitch, you're just relying on Mr. White liking you, aren't you? Just you wait; I'll make you never be able to swagger again!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After grumbling to himself in frustration for a while, he finally followed after her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When they returned to Sakra Society, it was still uncertain whether Yinson would punish him, but Jake didn't dare to run. He knew he couldn't escape the control of Sakra Society.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking of Yinson's ruthlessness, Jake felt extremely fearful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just a few hours later, Loscity Hospital had quieted down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Originally, this place was filled with infected patients, but after everyone drank the antidote, they had all significantly improved, or even fully recovered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Almost everyone has left the hospital, whether they were patients or medical staff; only a few remained.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, Blaze sneaked into the hospital's billing office.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked around and muttered to himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While looking around, he muttered to himself, "That motherfucker, he actually managed to eliminate the plague. Fuck, I haven't even slept with that bitch Melin yet, and he's already ruined my plans... Such an idiot, to provide free treatment without making any money, what a fool!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blaze kept cursing Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Recently, due to the rampant plague and the ensuing chaos, with banks closed, a massive amount of cash had accumulated in the hospital's billing office.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blaze was just waiting for the right opportunity to clear out all the cash from the </span><span>billing office, so he could enjoy endless wealth for the rest of his life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although he was a relative of Yinson, he was not highly regarded by him and was therefore just a low-ranking member of the Sakra Society.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The money he got from the Sakra Society was even less than his salary at the hospital, let alone enough to enjoy life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After sneaking into the billing office, Blaze saw several large locked cabinets, which were used for storing cash.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blaze's eyes lit up; with so many patients admitted to the hospital recently, there must be at least tens of millions of dollars in those cabinets.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he could take those tens of millions of dollars and spend it frugally, it would be enough for the rest of his life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He took out the tools and pried open the cabinet door, and countless banknotes immediately appeared before his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blaze couldn't wait to open the suitcase, scooping up the banknotes with both hands and stuffing them into the suitcase, wishing he had more hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The hospital was quiet, with no one around. Blaze sped up, his movements becoming even more rough.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He accidentally moved too abruptly, knocking over a chair. The loud crash immediately echoed out, reverberating through the empty hallway.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who!?" A woman's reprimanding voice sounded from outside; it turned out to be Melin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was on her way back to the police station when she heard a noise coming from the payment counter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The doors and windows of the payment counter were tightly shut, with not a sound coming from inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melin frowned in confusion, thinking, "Could I have heard wrong? Was it just my imagination?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She knocked hard on the door, but no one responded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melin thought of the huge amount of cash piled up at the payment counter and immediately felt something was amiss.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She pulled out her gun and banged on the door, yelling, "Who's inside? Open the door, or I'll shoot!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sound of knocking and shouting echoed through the empty corridor, carrying far away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blaze was completely flustered; he never would have thought that he would be discovered by Melin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melin was the captain of the police squad. Blaze, with a guilty conscience, couldn't control his body from shaking, and his back was drenched in cold sweat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he were to be caught by Melin, it would be terrible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blaze looked around, but there was only one exit at the toll booth, and there was no way out.</span></p><div class="pagination">
