How am I short-sighted?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brittany was shocked because Quentin used to be the one who paid the most attention to family background.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He patted her head and said with a wry smile, "Alexander is definitely not an ordinary person. If he is given enough time, he will become a great man!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brittany couldn't help smiling, "Grandpa, even if he is so outstanding, can he still surpass you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quentin frowned seriously, "Brittany, you don't know what the Red Umbrella Group is researching. As long as they make a mistake, the entire human race will be affected. </span><span>By then, even I won't be able to protect myself...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The troubled times may not be far away, and they will definitely come!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She also became worried immediately and thought that the Red Umbrella Group must have done something bad to make Quentin so uneasy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander had just left when he received a call from Avery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, hurry! Go to Miranda Hotel. Madelyn was deceived by Owen. She sent me a message asking for help. You must think of a solution quickly."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bastard!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was furious and immediately stepped on the accelerator and rushed toward Miranda Hotel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The top floor of Miranda Hotel featured </span><span>Tijuanea's</span><span> most upscale club.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The people who went there to consume were either rich or noble; ordinary people could not get in at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were beautiful women, fine wine, and the strictest security measures. As long as people were VIP members of Miranda Hotel, they could enjoy the top protection.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if they were being hunted by their enemies, as long as they were VIP members, entering Miranda Hotel was like arriving at a safe house.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But to become Miranda Hotel's VIP member, it took more than just money.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One also needed first-class social status and identity and to pay millions of dollars in membership fees each year to become a VIP member.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, in a luxurious private room on the top floor of Miranda Hotel, Marcos was chatting and laughing with Owen, very excited.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A blush appeared on Marcos' pale face because of excitement and excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Owen smiled and flattered him, "Marcos, you are much smarter than me. Madelyn can't get away this time!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, Marcos laughed triumphantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She hid in the bathroom, listening to the evil laugh outside, and was very anxious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Madelyn never expected that Owen was actually Marx's cousin and dared to use Dawson's name to trick her into coming here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fortunately, she left a message for Avery, but after waiting for a long time, no one came to rescue her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, the bathroom door was slammed several times.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcos shouted, "Madelyn, why do you take so long to go to the bathroom? If you don't come out, I'll just come in. Don't say I'm rude to you then..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The evil laugh frightened her so much that she dared not say a word.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He banged on the door while teasing Madelyn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking of her sexy and plump breasts, round and firm buttocks, and delicate and beautiful facial features, Marcos immediately felt a surge of desire and could no longer restrain himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Owen took out a small medicine bottle and said flatteringly, "Marcos, this is the aphrodisiac I prepared. Any woman who takes this will immediately become a slut who can be fucked by anyone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I spent a lot of effort and money to get this medicine. Marcos, you must remember my kindness and let me play with her when you get tired of her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcos snatched the small medicine bottle and pushed him away impatiently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay, wait until I get tired of playing with her. I won't get tired of this kind of top-notch beauty unless I play with her for a year or two."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, I'm not in a hurry. I can wait."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Owen quickly stepped aside with a complicated expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Madelyn was the woman he had been drooling over, but she had to be given to Marcos personally for his enjoyment. It was still unknown whether Owen could enjoy her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But thinking of the humiliation he had </span><span>suffered,</span><span> Owen began to grin excitedly again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dare you to bully me? You will soon find out that you can't afford to offend me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, Alexander had arrived at Miranda Hotel's door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop! You are not allowed to come in. We only accept VIP members here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Several burly men stopped Alexander.</span></p><div class="pagination">
