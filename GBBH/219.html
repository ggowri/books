I'll wrap this up in ten minutes, and then we'll hit a five-star hotel buffet. After that, some real fun."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're such a bad boy," she laughed, teasing him back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They flirted openly, oblivious to anyone else around them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, all the shop owners on Gemstone Street gathered. The Ulysses family had long controlled the street, supplying goods to these shops, so everyone wanted to stay on their good side.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dad, the Carter family is here!" Angelica pointed out as the group approached.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aiden's expression turned deadly. "Let's go meet them."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the shop owners in tow, the Ulysses family went to confront the Carters.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Isaac, it's been a while. Good to see you're still... kicking," Aiden greeted, his words laced with irony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isaac snorted. "Of course I am, Aiden. I wouldn't dream of leaving this world before you do."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aiden's demeanor shifted to anger. "Isaac, you dare to challenge my family's authority and eye the management of Gemstone Street? This is unacceptable! Today, we settle this. A duel. The winner takes control of Gemstone Street, and the loser pays ten </span><span>million dollars. Agreed?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isaac smirked confidently. "Agreed!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From behind Isaac emerged a burly man with calloused fists, clearly a seasoned fighter. Aiden patted Kevin on the shoulder, full of anticipation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kevin, we're counting on you. Don't let us down!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kevin thumped his chest with confidence. "Aiden, I've got this!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Kevin stepped into the ring with the strong man, the tension in the air was palpable. The crowd buzzed with excitement, eager to see who would prevail.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two fighters exchanged initial blows, quickly escalating into a fierce battle. Kevin's skill was evident as he soon forced his opponent to retreat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Go, Kevin!" Angelica cheered, excitement bubbling over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Ulysses family watched eagerly as victory seemed within reach. Isaac's face darkened, realizing his expensive hire was no match for Kevin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emboldened by the cheers, Kevin deliberately left an opening. The strong man seized the opportunity, rushing in, only to be met with a powerful uppercut to the chin from Kevin. Kevin followed with a flurry of punches, knocking the man out cold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cheers erupted. Aiden and Angelica laughed in triumph. Kevin stood victorious in the ring, raising his fist. "Who dares challenge me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I do!" came a cold voice, cutting through the noise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Silence fell as everyone turned to see Julia and Aiden approaching. Aiden glared at Julia. "What's this about, Julia?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julia met his gaze calmly. "As a member of the Ulysses family, I have the right to challenge the head according to clan rules."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aiden scoffed. "You think you can take my place? Who's going to beat Kevin? Your son, Xavier?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He laughed dismissively.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Xavier bristled but was held back by Julia, who smiled. "Not my son, but someone I've hired."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aiden sneered. "Kevin's one of the best in </span><span>Loscity</span><span>. Who could you possibly hire?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kevin smirked. "Bring them on. I'll take them down."</span></p><div class="pagination">
