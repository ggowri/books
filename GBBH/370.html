He can be saved."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander channeled the Force into his hands and placed them gently on Ralph's body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A solemn, heavy energy filled the room, and everyone tensed up, watching intently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's Force energy entered Ralph's body, slowly gathering and expelling the toxins that had been spreading inside him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gradually, drops of dark, tainted blood began trickling from Ralph's nose and ears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing this strange sight, everyone held their breath, watching Alexander treat Ralph with mixed expressions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The doctors, who had initially doubted Alexander, now looked stunned, faces full of surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even so, they still didn't entirely believe Alexander could cure Ralph.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Byron arrived at the Hansen Villa in his Ferrari, leading a grand procession of cars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A dozen black sedans lined up as several men in black suits exited, along with Orion and a few of the Hansen family members.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Led by Orion, they all gathered behind Byron.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What do you want?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The security guards blocked their way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Orion shouted angrily, "Get out of my way! Don't you see I'm back?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The security guards' faces fell, and they stepped aside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ever since Ralph fell ill, Orion had broken free from house arrest and gathered some Hansen family supporters to seize the head position.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Out of my way, fools!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Orion kicked down one guard and strode inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Byron followed closely, chuckling darkly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Orion said flatteringly, "Don't worry, Mr. Clifford. Ralph's as good as dead today, and I'll make sure Rebecca goes with you obediently."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A smile had just crossed Byron's face when he noticed a Porsche parked nearby, and his expression darkened again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Byron was instantly enraged, storming over to the Porsche and kicking it hard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bang! Bang!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He shattered both front headlights.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Still not satisfied, Byron angrily ordered his men, "Smash it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His men grabbed pipes and axes, smashing the car wildly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Beep!

That's Ms. Hansen's car!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One of the security guards yelled angrily, rushing forward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Byron gave a vicious wave. "Smash Anyone who tries to stop me with the car!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Ralph critically ill, the Hansen family members had split into two factions, most siding with Orion. None could resist Byron's prepared forces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cries of pain and calls for help rang out as every person who tried to block Byron was knocked down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quentin and Rebecca were both alerted, but Alexander was tied up with the treatment and couldn't leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Outside, the car alarms, shouts, and cries of pain continued, a clear sign of trouble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's going on?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rebecca hurried outside to ask.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing the smashed-up car and Hansen family members sprawled all over the ground, Rebecca's anger flared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Rebecca, Byron and Orion immediately gathered their group and surrounded her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Rebecca, this is what you get for hitting me on purpose! Hand over the culprit and come home with me, or I'll make you regret it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Byron shouted excitedly, without a trace of shame.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rebecca's face darkened with anger. This guy was not only falsely accusing her but completely twisting the story. It's unbelievable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Byron, you're the one who tried to hit us with your car, and now you're blaming us? You can dream if you think I'm going home with you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rebecca spat in Byron's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Byron was furious, nearly choking with anger as he cursed and wiped the spit off his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Orion quickly stepped forward, putting on an act as if he were protecting Byron.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Rebecca, you conspired with Alexander to poison Grandpa and tried to cause a car accident to kill Mr. Clifford. These are serious crimes. It's unforgivable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As head of the Hansen family, I declare that you are now expelled from the family and handed over to Mr. Clifford to deal with!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
