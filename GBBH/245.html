  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He quickly opened the ceiling panel and climbed inside nimbly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A middle-aged man, escorted by a dozen men in black, strode towards him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though dressed casually, the man was striking, with an imposing presence and a menacing air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Especially his sinister eyes, which, when they flickered, seemed like those of a gloomy predator ready to pounce.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Bryant, you've emerged from seclusion? That's wonderful!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A housekeeper-like middle-aged woman rushed to greet him, swiftly opening a grand door for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander watched this scene from the gap in the ceiling, his spirits lifting upon hearing "Mr. Bryant".</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had finally found Guzman!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing his half-brother for the first time, Alexander was filled with mixed emotions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though they were siblings from different mothers, they were at odds over the position of Godfather.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, Guzman had repeatedly attempted to assassinate him and his family. Alexander would show no mercy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A pair of young, sexy women emerged from the room, giggling as they clung tightly to Guzman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two sexy beauties looked alike, clearly indicating they were twin sisters.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These identical twin sisters, barely in their twenties, were strikingly attractive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their voluptuous figures were barely covered by a few straps and tight fabric, more revealing than a bikini, showcasing their sensual forms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The dozen men in black, however, dared not even glance their way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These twin sisters were among Guzman's favorite indulgences. Anyone careless enough to offend them would suffer a terrible fate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Darling, you've finally emerged!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sisters welcomed Guzman with coquettish voices, pressing their ample bosoms against his arm without restraint.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Guzman chuckled, squeezing their pert derrieres firmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A large group of people respectfully escorted Guzman into the room, and the grand door closed tightly behind them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander swiftly moved across the ceiling. Aided by the Force, he moved at an incredible speed and made no unnecessary noise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Through the ceiling's crack, Alexander saw Guzman take a seat in the middle of the </span><span>large sofa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Congratulations on your emergence, Mr. Bryant!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone bowed in unison.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Guzman, with the sisters in his arms, merely hummed from his nose.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His mood was a mix of joy and worry. He was delighted that he was about to break through. All he needed was a significant ritual, and he could smoothly advance to become a white wizard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was worried because John had lost contact. At this point, John should have come to see him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But John had vanished, unreachable, which clearly indicated something terrible had happened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Guzman contacted the trading center, relieved to find it was unharmed. It must have been an incident on John's way to see him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With John's skills, ordinary people posed no threat to him. It must have been someone else's doing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Guzman thought of the Red Umbrella Group but immediately dismissed the idea.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Red Umbrella Group wouldn't completely break ties with him before the potential potion was perfected.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The most likely suspect was Alexander. Had he finally found his way here?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn Alexander!" Guzman cursed angrily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sensing Guzman's foul mood, everyone dared not breathe heavily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Summon Cloe and the Bryant family members."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Guzman issued the command, and his subordinates acted immediately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The atmosphere in the room became even more oppressive, like the calm before a storm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, dozens of men and women, young and old, arrived in the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They rubbed their sleepy eyes, some even in pajamas and slippers, having been brought here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Including bodyguards and the Bryant family members, the large luxurious room now held thirty or forty people.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Guzman said nothing, coldly observing his relatives.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They whispered among themselves, speculating on why Guzman had called them here late at night.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Guzman's adopted daughter, Cloe Bryant, entered, everyone immediately fell silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cloe, who had been adopted by Guzman since she was young and was known for her boldness, was now as quiet as a lamb before a tiger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The cruise ship appeared to be under Cloe's control, but she knew that Guzman was the true mastermind.</span></p><div class="pagination">
