  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you asleep again? I'm talking to you, dumbass! Cat got your tongue?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But there was still no response. Calvin and the other two turned to look.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instantly, all three froze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A dark gun barrel was pressed right to Calvin's forehead!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The cold, murderous gun had Calvin frozen in place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The gun belonged to the bald man, who was now slumped over, out cold. Somehow, Alexander was now sitting silently in the van.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey, buddy, what's this about? We're with The Cripples, don't think we've crossed you, so why do this?" Calvin said with a forced smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvin grinned, hoping to bluff his way out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander knocked out the two goons with the butt of his gun, then grabbed Calvin by the neck and dragged him to the driver's seat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Drive. Take me to the one calling the shots. Maybe you'll live."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander pressed the gun against Calvin's groin and clicked off the safety, almost making Calvin wet himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't kill me, please! I'll take </span><span>you,</span><span> I'll take you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvin pleaded frantically, starting the van with trembling hands, and drove Alexander toward the outskirts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, at an estate on the east side of town.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eddie, leader of The Cripples, was drinking with two scantily-clad women clinging to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Boss, you're amazing! I want to spend the night with you again."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Boss, you're the strongest man I've ever known."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two women leaned into Eddie, seductively stroking his chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hahaha!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eddie laughed happily, feeling on top of the world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had been in </span><span>Loscity</span><span> for days and finally had a chance to relax.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Boss, Calvin's car is back."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One of his men ran over to report.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eddie was groping the women, but his eyes lit up at the news.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Calvin is our top enforcer, after all. He must've succeeded. Bring that beauty Ava over for me to see."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Boss, it seems Calvin only brought back the guy, Alexander."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He captured Alexander? Calvin really did it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Overjoyed, Eddie shoved the woman in his lap aside and said excitedly, "Alexander's magic powder formula is priceless. Bring him in right now. I want to interrogate him personally and find out what happened to Joseph and </span><span>Houtte</span><span>."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bang!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as he finished speaking, there was a loud crash.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The heavy wooden door flew off its hinges, slamming into the messenger and knocking him to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man collapsed, coughing up blood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander strolled in with a calm smile on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked as relaxed as if he were taking a stroll in the park after a full meal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eddie was stunned for a moment, then exploded with rage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, do you even know who I am? How dare you cause trouble here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Several of his bodyguards immediately surrounded Alexander, brimming with hostility.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander sneered, ignoring the men surrounding him as he strode directly toward Eddie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The lead guard, a man with a buzz cut, grew furious at Alexander's dismissive attitude.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You've got a death wish, causing trouble on our turf!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He drew a gleaming knife and stabbed it toward Alexander's chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander moved calmly, pinching the knife between two fingers and stopping it cold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let go! Let go, damn it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The guard cursed, using every ounce of his strength, but he couldn't pull the knife free.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No matter how much the guard twisted the knife, the blade didn't budge, leaving everyone around in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the next second, Alexander kicked the guy, sending him flying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The remaining three bodyguards looked frightened and cautiously took a few steps </span><span>back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, I am Eddie, leader of The Cripples! Today, you're not leaving here alive!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eddie cursed through gritted teeth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Alexander's strength surprised him, this was The Cripples' main </span><span>Loscity</span><span> base, and reinforcements would arrive soon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No matter how strong Alexander was, could he really take on dozens, maybe even hundreds, alone?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander asked calmly, "The Cripples' backer is the Godfather, Satan. He's trying to go after my father, isn't he?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eddie paused, confused, and asked, "Your father? Who is your father?"</span></p><div class="pagination">
