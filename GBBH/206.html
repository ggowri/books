You actually hired a lawyer to countersue me for defamation? You scammed our family out of millions, and now you dare to sue me? Do you really think you can get that million back?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aren't you defaming me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander laughed, impressed by how quick Madelyn was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmph! I'm not scared. I don't think your lawyer stands a chance against mine. I've got a top lawyer this time; do you think you can compete with me?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you're brave, come out and chat by the courthouse; the one who doesn't come is a coward!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane hung up the phone abruptly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander only laughed; the more upset Jane got, the happier he felt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Madelyn and Alexander immediately rushed to the meeting spot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Half an hour later, as Alexander got out of the car, someone shouted, "That's Alexander!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane angrily pointed at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Next to her stood a well-dressed, sharply polished middle-aged man, clearly Jane's lawyer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm Rowan Poole, the lawyer hired by Ms. Fairfax."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rowan raised his chin slightly, his disdainful gaze and posture clearly showing he didn't regard Alexander as a threat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Alexander silent, Rowan thought he was intimidated and started to smirk.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was a well-known lawyer in </span><span>Loscity</span><span>; while not a top-tier attorney, he was certainly in the advanced category.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if Jane's case lacked solid evidence, Rowan believed he still had a chance to win </span><span>with his skills.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, you're countersuing my client for defamation; I advise you to withdraw your suit and apologize to Ms. Fairfax while making amends.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you do that, Ms. Fairfax might forgive you, and once you provide satisfactory compensation, we can drop the case.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Otherwise, if you lose, the compensation you owe my client will exceed fifty million, which is money you'll never earn in several lifetimes."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rowan threatened with a fierce tone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You want me to pay?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander couldn't help but laugh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane glared at him. "What are you laughing at? With Mr. Poole on my side, you won't escape paying."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander ignored them, being a gentleman and holding the car door open for Madelyn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>First, a pair of long, attractive legs emerged, and then Madelyn appeared with charm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had a great height, especially with her high heels, making her figure exceptionally tall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The professional skirt suit hugged her beautiful form, accentuating her curves, especially her extraordinarily ample chest, which was incredibly tempting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Whether it was Rowan or the men around, all eyes were on Madelyn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane said unhappily, "Well, Alexander, you're really shameless, using Ava's money to find a woman on the side."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was filled with jealousy and sadness, having to admit that the women around Alexander were all prettier and had better figures than she did.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rowan paused for a moment. "Ms. Price?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The legal circle in </span><span>Loscity</span><span> was small, so he had indeed seen Madelyn, the intern from </span><span>Loscity</span><span> Wealth Counsel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although she was just an intern, </span><span>Loscity</span><span> Wealth Counsel was a top-tier firm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Plus, Madelyn was beautiful, had a great figure, and had landed a position at the best law firm throughout the whole city, so she drew a lot of attention.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smiled and said, "This is my lawyer. Why don't you repeat what you just threatened me with and see if my lawyer agrees?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madelyn, you're Alexander's lawyer?" Rowan frowned and asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wasn't afraid of Madelyn; he was worried about the connections behind </span><span>Loscity</span><span> Wealth Counsel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's right, I'm Mr. Hawthorne's authorized representative, and I advise you to back off before you embarrass yourselves!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Madelyn was confident.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rowan's expression turned serious as he scoffed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's an intern like you? You really think you're a big deal?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, a cold voice came from the side.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Rowan, in my eyes, you don't even matter!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A stern-looking middle-aged man approached, wearing a white shirt, a blue tie, and a fitted black suit, holding a briefcase, radiating authority.</span></p><div class="pagination">
