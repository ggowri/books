  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander estimated that it would take at least a month to finish the mysterious magic circle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if enough construction machines and workers were working around the clock, it would still take no less than two weeks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could already feel the urgency of the situation; the time was too tight for him to elevate his strength to that of an Advanced Warrior.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, to upgrade the Lightsabers to level two, he needed top-grade orange and purple gems.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Augusta had quietly approached the square as per Alexander's instructions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He restrained his power; although he was on the verge of breaking through to level three supernatural abilities, he moved like a shadow, almost invisible in the darkness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if someone happened to glance in his direction, Augusta seemed to vanish under the cover of night.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nearby, some members of the construction team were resting, smoking, eating, and chatting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I heard that once this magic circle is completed, a grand ceremony will take place to summon the divine power to Earth," one worker said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Really? You must be joking!" another replied, sounding skeptical.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Rock of the City of Sorcery mentioned it. I happened to be nearby that day and caught a bit of the conversation."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The magic circle of the City of Sorcery?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Some were left speechless, clearly intimidated by the mere mention of it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, the City of Sorcery was very mysterious in everyone's mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry. We just need to do our jobs and get paid. This magic circle doesn't concern us! The point is that the Red Umbrella Group is offering double the salary. Otherwise, who would want to work here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Exactly. We're here to make money. We just need to focus on our work."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Listening to the workers' chatter, Alexander had many plans, such as whether he should destroy the magic circle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But if he destroyed it, Felix might not show up, which could lead to worse consequences.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After pondering, he said, "Don't destroy the magic circle completely, but we can slow down their progress."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Understood, Boss!" Augusta agreed confidently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Brilliant Group had the upper hand on Treasure Island and had plenty of ways to delay their progress&mdash;like cutting off their water and electricity or sending in a team to carry out sabotage and blow up a few pillars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was determined to locate the remaining two gems as soon as possible to upgrade the lightsaber to level two, significantly boosting his combat prowess.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next morning, Alexander immediately called Xavier and Oscar over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once Xavier understood Alexander's needs, he apologized profusely. "I'm really sorry, Alexander. There haven't been any top-grade gems on the market lately. If there were, I'd buy them no matter the cost."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Oscar bowed deeply and respectfully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was no longer the same person he had once been, and even Nancy treated him with special care, so naturally, Oscar didn't dare offend him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you want to find top-grade gemstones quickly, you'll need to go to Gatheolia or Soutaxia. Most of the gems in The Kaylon come from those two places," Oscar suggested.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Xavier quickly added, "If you're going, I can guide you. I'm very familiar with both places."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Great! Thank you. Go back and get packed. We'll leave in three hours," Alexander replied, patting Xavier on the shoulder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the Ultimate Alliance backing them, the Ulysses family had significantly expanded its business and was raking in profits daily. So, Xavier was trying to return Alexander for his help.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Alice spoke up, "Mr. Hawthorne, I'd like to join you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Betty, who had been considering saying something, felt a sense of relief. Even if she had suggested it, Alexander would likely refuse to let her come along.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, she was in charge of the Ultimate Alliance, and if she left, it could come to a standstill.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander looked Alice over a few times, noticing her eagerness, and realized she felt overlooked lately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He nodded. "Alright, have the plane ready. You can come with me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alice beamed with joy, her eyes shining as she looked at Alexander.</span></p><div class="pagination">
