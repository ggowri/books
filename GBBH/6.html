  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava pondered in silence for a moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Finally, she nodded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Fine, I'll give you this chance. But if you're lying to me, I'll have you strung up here for three days and nights!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This was already Ava showing mercy. The last man who tried to touch her was a drunk, and he ended up as fish food in the river.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander knew Ava wasn't just any ordinary person, but he had full confidence in the Force.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He was eager to see if it was truly as miraculous as James had described.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Emma couldn't hold back her objections.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Ms. Blackburn, are you really going to let him touch your chest? I think he's just..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Shut up! This is not your concern."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava shot her an icy glare.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Emma shuddered and didn't dare say another word, though her dissatisfaction with Alexander grew even stronger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander placed his hand on Ava's white silk blouse. Her subtle, feminine fragrance washed over him, making his heartbeat quicken.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava's chest was full and firm, her blouse unbuttoned at the top, revealing a deep cleavage.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The soft feeling beneath his hand made it hard for Alexander not to squeeze, and when he did, he couldn't help but notice that Ava's chest was fuller and more elastic than Jane's.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava's face flushed bright red, and she nearly slapped him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The bodyguards standing nearby glared at Alexander, their eyes filled with fury. To them, Ava was a goddess, and seeing her being touched was unbearable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just as things were about to escalate, Alexander activated the Force. Instantly, his mind became clear, and the surge of desire vanished without a trace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Ms. Blackburn, I'm starting the treatment now."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The Force flowed through Alexander's hand, merging into Ava's chest and spreading within her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At first, Ava frowned slightly, but then her eyes narrowed, and a look of comfort spread across her face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She even unconsciously pushed her chest forward, allowing Alexander better access.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her expression and her figure were truly mesmerizing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The bodyguards' eyes widened, nearly popping out of their heads.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At first, Alexander was clumsy in channeling the Force, but he soon became more proficient.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The Force flowed steadily into Ava's heart, expanding her narrowed arteries, dissolving blockages, and strengthening her heart muscles.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava felt a warm sensation spread through her chest, and her heartbeats became stronger and more regular. The tightness and pain in her chest completely disappeared.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her entire body felt as if it were floating in a warm spring, utterly relaxed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After a few minutes, Alexander was drenched in sweat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After all, he was only a Novice Warrior.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Though the Force passed down from James was powerful, his skill was still unrefined, and he was barely able to channel even one percent of it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Struggling to maintain the energy flow, Alexander finally withdrew his hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But before he did, he couldn't resist one last squeeze of her soft, full chest.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava's face flushed with embarrassment, and she glared at him. "Pervert, did you enjoy that?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander couldn't help but nod.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava gave him a disdainful look, then touched her chest, took a deep breath, and was immediately thrilled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The previous chest tightness and pain were completely gone, and it was no illusion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was miraculous!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She felt Alexander really had some talent. No wonder the Godfather had chosen him as her fianc&eacute;.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava, who had initially been resistant to the idea of marrying Alexander, now found herself pleasantly surprised. It seemed there were many secrets hidden within him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Emma, noticing Ava's changing expressions, assumed the treatment had failed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She immediately shouted, "Alexander, you're despicable! You took advantage of Ms. Blackburn under the guise of treatment! Break his hands!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The bodyguards, already filled with jealousy, closed in on Alexander, ready to attack.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Stop! What do you think you're doing?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava shouted in anger, halting them in their tracks.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Emma, whose hands do you think you're going to break?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She turned her icy gaze on Emma, her eyes as cold as frost.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Emma froze, stammering, unable to respond.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I feel much better now. Apologize to Alexander immediately, or I'll have you fired from the Saint Group!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava commanded coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Ms. Blackburn, I..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Emma's face twisted with discomfort as she tried to explain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Three."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Two."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava's voice was chilling as she began counting down.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Emma knew that once Ava reached "one," her high-paying job would be gone, and she might even be executed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Immediately, Emma bowed deeply to Alexander, her voice trembling as she apologized, "Mr. Hawthorne, I'm sorry. Please forgive me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander glanced at her and replied calmly, "Even though you've been against me, I don't bully women. I'll let it go this time."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava raised an eyebrow, surprised by the authority and calmness radiating from Alexander. She felt he certainly didn't seem like the useless man others thought him to be.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She waved her hand. "Everyone, leave. I want to speak with Mr. Hawthorne alone."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Emma and the bodyguards lowered their heads and slowly left the room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As the door closed behind them, Emma shot Ava a complex look, and she thought, "Is Ms. Blackburn really going to sleep with this guy?"</p><div class="pagination">
