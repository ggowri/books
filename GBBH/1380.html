  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the center of the stone chamber stood a small birchwood altar, upon which rested a deity statue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The statue depicted a middle-aged man with his hair tied high in a topknot. His hands were clasped behind his back, and he wore ceremonial robes. A sinister smirk played on his lips, his narrow, slanted eyes gleaming with a chilling menace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Coiling around the statue was an intricately carved eight-headed, eight-tailed serpent, its massive body exhaling mist. In front of the statue lay two bronze plaques. One side bore the image of the deity, while the back had the character "Royal" engraved on it, with another symbol below it meaning "Secret."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander glanced at the plaques. "So it really is the Sacred Spirit Order! I don't know who this statue represents, but that eight-headed, eight-tailed serpent is definitely the Orochi."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Internal energy, Levitating Technique, Solar Fist, Piercing Wave... and now the Orochi? These Risunese aren't going to be easy to deal with."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Logan stroked his chin, his expression shifting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Along the stone walls, more than a dozen large, locked chests sat in neat rows.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander casually picked a chest, twisted off the iron lock, and lifted the lid. A dazzling silver light filled the room&mdash;inside, neatly stacked silver ingots filled the entire three-foot-wide box.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes lit up, and a wave of exhilaration washed over him. Jackpot! He was rich!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He turned and opened another chest&mdash;gold glinted blindingly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hahaha!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander threw his head back and laughed wildly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Logan's face flushed with excitement as he flung open the remaining chests. Gold, silver, and jewels shimmered in every direction, as if they had just stumbled into the treasure trove of Ali Baba himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander steadied himself and took inventory&mdash;ten chests of silver ingots, two chests of gold, half a chest of jewels, and one final chest containing a ledger and an iron box.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He picked up the ledger and flipped through it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sacred Spirit Gang: 206,850 silver coins, 17,600 gold coins, half a chest of jewelry and jade. Population: 6,836. Warhorses: 500. Refined iron armor: 2,000. High-quality leather armor: 3,000. Longbows: 500. Heavy crossbows: 200. Arrows: over 20,000. Spears..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Logan grabbed the iron box, opened it, and found a thick stack of letters. He pulled out a few and skimmed through them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My Lord... We have received the 20,000 silver coins you shipped from Risun. From the Lord of Darwin, we have successfully acquired iron armor...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My Lord... I will do my utmost to bring the brigands of Oxhead Mountain under control. As soon as matters in Xhantao are settled, I will personally come to Darwin..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Logan's face darkened. "Alexander! This gold and silver were smuggled from Risun to Hrodvik to fund recruitment. Looks like they're up to something big!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander skimmed through a few more letters. "Hmm... There's no name, but whoever this is, they must be someone powerful."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He pondered for a moment. There were too many chests&mdash;his Dimensional Pouch wouldn't fit them all. He had to take the most valuable items first.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He quickly stored two chests of gold. Just as he reached for the half chest of jewels, a strange sensation flickered in his golden energy core.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Huh? Could there be something incredible inside this box?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He lifted the lid, revealing an array of gold and jade rings, bracelets, earrings, and hairpins, all gleaming brilliantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Alexander scooped up a handful, he could feel something at the bottom of the chest stirring his golden energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He reached in and pulled out a pendant necklace. The chain was twisted into a spiral shape, neither gold nor emerald in texture. When he tested its strength, he found it incredibly tough. The pendant itself was a milky white, translucent jade-like pearl.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander studied it, certain it was some kind of treasure, though he had no idea what it did.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since his golden energy core was reacting to it, it had to be important. He decided to keep it on him and figure it out later.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Logan watched with envy. "Alexander, your bag is straight out of a sci-fi novel! A real space storage item&mdash;this is insane!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander tossed the half chest of jewels into his Dimensional Pouch and chuckled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Logan, you're already at the peak of a level-two warrior. Once you pass the Outer Court selection, I'll get you one too."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying that, he loaded five more chests of silver ingots. When he saw that his Spatial Bag was nearly full, he threw in the two bronze plaques, the letters, and the ledger as well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two returned to the stone chamber, carefully moving the large water vat back into place before stepping outside. There, they found Ryker waiting obediently, his back turned and his face directed away, not daring to look.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander nodded in approval and patted him on the shoulder before the three of them headed to the main hall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inside the main hall, a grand feast was laid out on a large table. Alexander took the seat at the head, with Logan to his left, followed by Josh, Ivan, and Ryker.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander raised his mug and smiled. "You've all worked hard. Cheers!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone drank in one go.</span></p><div class="pagination">
