  <div class="container"><p style="text-align:left;">He slowly stood up, coldly staring at Stephen, locking him in with a terrifying gaze.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Um?&quot; Stephen&#x27;s face changed as he felt the air around him grow heavy, as if a terrifying thunderstorm was about to descend.</p><p style="text-align:left;">He shot a fierce glare at Alexander, his expression filled with confusion and disbelief.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Alexander stood with his hands clasped behind his back, observing Stephen with a completely relaxed posture and a deep, unfathomable gaze.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Stephen couldn&#x27;t help but shiver. In that instant, it felt as if all of his secrets were laid bare, exposed by him. There was no hiding anything.</p><p style="text-align:left;">It was a chilling feeling.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Stephen finally took this seriously, gripping the hilt of his sword tightly, his brows deeply furrowed.</p><p style="text-align:left;">He hadn&#x27;t paid attention to Alexander when he entered because Alexander had seemed too ordinary, not like a real expert at all.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Now, Stephen realized how badly he had underestimated him. Among everyone here, only this young man was truly his match.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Who the hell are you?&quot; Stephen demanded gravely.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Alexander gave a faint smile. &quot;Stephen, I heard you&#x27;re the newly crowned number one expert of Sakra Society, and you&#x27;ve used enhancement drugs, right?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;That&#x27;s right. What are you trying to say?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Stephen gripped the hilt, ready to strike at any moment.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Then you must know where Yinson is. If you tell me everything about Yinson, I might consider sparing your life.&quot; Alexander spoke as if it were a simple request.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;You want to find Mr. White? Who the hell are you?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Stephen&#x27;s eyes swept over Alexander. He suddenly thought about someone. His face immediately changed drastically.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;You&#x27;re Alexander!&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">He shouted in anger, pulling out two sabers in an instant, a murderous aura radiating from him.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Alexander smiled faintly, &quot;Yes, that&#x27;s right, it&#x27;s me.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">At first, Stephen was shocked, but then he grew excited, his expression turning even more vicious.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Alexander, you dared to make our Sakra Society suffer, nearly putting Mr. White in a position where he couldn&#x27;t recover. I will make you pay for that!</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Tyler and the others must have died at your hands. Today, I&#x27;m going to chop off your arms and legs, turn you into a cripple, leaving you to suffer huge pain.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Stephen gritted his teeth, wishing he could tear Alexander apart immediately.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Stephen&#x27;s murderous intent grew more intense. Karson and Cesar were both shocked. From Stephen&#x27;s words, it seemed that Alexander had once dealt a heavy blow to Sakra Society.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Karson&#x27;s face revealed an expression of hope and excitement. Perhaps this time, there was still a chance. He saw a glimmer of hope for survival.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;You were so arrogant earlier. Now, why are you talking so much?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Alexander&#x27;s Enhanced Vision locked onto Stephen, taking in all of his physical condition. What part of him was strong, where his weaknesses were, it was all clear, laid bare before him.</p><p style="text-align:left;">In Alexander&#x27;s powerful mind, he instantly simulated dozens, even hundreds, of Stephen&#x27;s movements.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Each version of Stephen launched a different attack at him, including subsequent combos. He knew exactly how to respond, how to defeat Stephen.</p><p style="text-align:left;">This was the power of an Advanced Warrior, completely surpassing human limits.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Alexander disdainfully beckoned to Stephen with a finger. &quot;Come on, I&#x27;ll give you three moves without fighting back.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Karson immediately warned him in fear, &quot;Alex, don&#x27;t be careless. This guy is the top expert of Sakra Society. Earlier, even Mr. Dussel and the others were no match for him. You need to be cautious!&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">But Alexander just smiled dismissively.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Stephen was furious. This was the greatest insult he had ever received.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;You want to give me three moves without fighting back? Fine, very well. Today, I&#x27;ll cripple you, and then you&#x27;ll know how wrong you were.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Stephen stopped holding back and drew both of his sabers.</p><p style="text-align:left;">The blade power was twice as vast as before. The massive sword light, like two new moons, slashed toward Alexander, aiming to cut him into pieces.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Alexander kept his promise, not fighting back. He dodged and retreated effortlessly.</p><p style="text-align:left;">For a moment, Stephen held the advantage, fiercely chasing after Alexander.</p><p style="text-align:left;">But something strange happened. No matter how fast Stephen swung his blades, no matter how he surged forward, he couldn&#x27;t even touch Alexander.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Alexander seemed like a leaf caught in the wind, effortlessly drifting away from the blade&#x27;s wind, his movements graceful and light.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Every time it seemed like he was about to be struck, he would narrowly avoid it by mere millimeters.</p><div class="pagination">
