He still needed the orange, green, indigo, and purple top-tier gemstones to complete his collection.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With eighteen beads remaining in the bracelet, he decided not to experiment further.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After integrating a yellow orb into the lightsaber core, he felt a subconscious connection between the bracelet and the Ancestral Witch's Cane.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Ancestral Witch's Cane was acquired from Guzman and sought after by the City of Sorcery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, he had kept it well hidden and had never studied it in depth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had long established a conflict with the City of Sorcery, and sooner or later, they would come looking for him again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While Alexander possessed the Ultimate Legacy and was uninterested in sorcery, he was curious about the relationship between the bracelet and the Ancestral Witch's Cane.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He planned to investigate it as soon as he returned to </span><span>Loscity</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, Lynn rushed downstairs in tears, bolting out the door without a backward glance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was about to chase after her, but Ava stopped him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let her be. She's going through a tough time," Ava said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her tone was heavy with concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He nodded and took a seat again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava fell into his arms, tears welling in her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's wrong? Why are you crying?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Ava so upset, Alexander thought she might be feeling hurt by something.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I... I misunderstood my mom. All those years ago, everything she did was to support me, but I didn't understand. I ran away instead...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, seeing her so heartbroken makes me really sad," Ava said, her eyes red.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander sighed, "She'll be okay. Give it some time."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Ava shook her head, tears streaming down her face. "I saw antidepressants on her nightstand. After such a blow, she might fall into a deeper depression."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Depression?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander paused, realizing that while he could use the Force to heal physical ailments, mental health issues were beyond his reach.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava wiped her tears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Only the one who caused the pain can soothe it. A man caused this hurt, so it needs a man to mend it. But it can't be Victor; it needs to be someone reliable, someone she trusts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I think that's the most effective approach I can think of. I can't come up with anything else," Ava said, her tone suggesting something deeper, startling Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They fell silent for a moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava looked deeply into Alexander's eyes. "I need to ask you something, and you have to promise to answer honestly."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sure, go ahead."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For some reason, Alexander felt a surge of good fortune was about to come his way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How do you see my mom? Is she beautiful?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Uh! Why are you asking me this? What do you want me to say? She's my elder!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was taken aback.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava glared at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't think of her as an elder. Just answer me from a man's perspective&mdash;how does she look?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Reluctantly, he replied, "Of course she's beautiful. She has a great figure, not at all less than yours."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then... if I weren't your girlfriend, would you date my mom?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What! What kind of nonsense is that? How can you ask me such a question?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander raised his voice, angry at the suggestion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just answer me honestly!" Ava insisted firmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't know what you're talking about, and I don't want to answer," he said, standing up to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava quickly caught up to him, playfully clinging to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You have to answer! Come on, please..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, enough! If you weren't my girlfriend, maybe I would consider dating her. Are you satisfied now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Very satisfied! Don't worry; I won't leave you. I was just asking out of curiosity."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava smiled and planted a quick kiss on his cheek.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"By the way, tomorrow night is my mom's birthday. She was planning to celebrate with Victor, but now the task falls to us."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay, let's get ready!" Alexander agreed decisively.</span></p><div class="pagination">
