  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smiled faintly; it was obvious Roman liked Madelyn and saw him as a rival.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He followed them, listening to Madelyn and the others chat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Roman gave a serious reminder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madelyn, I had to jump through hoops to get Mr. Dukes to agree to come. Make sure you don't say anything out of line; offending him would be troublesome."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Madelyn nodded. "Don't worry, cousin. We're not that foolish."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Roman deliberately glanced at Alexander with a snarky tone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You certainly won't say anything inappropriate, but I'm just worried that some people might get arrogant and offend Mr. Dukes."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander just found it amusing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Madelyn quickly said, "Don't worry, Alexander won't say anything inappropriate."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing Madelyn call him "Alexander," Roman's face darkened, becoming even more displeased.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the private room door, Roman gave Alexander a sharp glare as a warning, then carefully opened the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone froze for a moment. They saw a bald, chubby man aggressively holding a waitress, touching and kissing her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let go of me, let go..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The waitress struggled desperately, but the man's grip was too strong, and he took full advantage of her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, as Roman opened the door, the man's expression changed, and he reluctantly let go.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The waitress, crying, tried to run outside, but the man grabbed her again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He pulled out a stack of dollars and forcibly stuffed them into her bra, smirking as he said, "Sweetheart, I'm your manager&rsquo;s friend. If you don't want to lose this job, you'd better keep quiet about this."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The waitress held her face, sobbing as she ran out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, the fat man finally turned to look at Roman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey! Where are your manners? Don't you know how to knock?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The fat man slapped the table and demanded loudly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Roman quickly put on a flattering smile and apologized.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Dukes, I'm really sorry for disturbing you. My mistake."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Madelyn and Avery also walked in, immediately drawing Janus' attention.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Janus sprang to his feet, his puffy goldfish eyes widening as he excitedly stared at Madelyn. He had never seen such a beautiful, elegant woman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Compared to this stunning woman, the other waitress was like heaven and earth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Roman hurriedly introduced.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Dukes, this is my cousin, Attorney Madelyn. She's here to discuss the matter of unfreezing the funds with you," Avery introduced.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Janus opened his arms in an overly enthusiastic gesture. "Welcome to </span><span>Tijuanea</span><span>, Ms. Price!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Madelyn, uncomfortable with his approach, deftly sidestepped, avoiding his embrace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Janus' expression briefly darkened with displeasure, though his gaze remained inappropriate. Avery, feeling the tension, stepped back slightly and forced a polite smile. "Mr. Dukes, hello. Let's get straight to business."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sure, let's sit down and talk," Janus replied, leering at Madelyn and gesturing for her to sit beside him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Madelyn opted to sit across from him instead. As she did, Janus reached for her hand with a sly grin. "Ms. Price, if you want those funds unfrozen, you'll need to show some sincerity. Spend some time with me today..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Madelyn quickly pulled her hand back, her voice firm. "Mr. Dukes, that's completely inappropriate."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Janus chuckled dismissively. "Those funds are substantial. Without my assistance, they remain frozen. We're all adults here; a little companionship in exchange for my help isn't too much to ask, is it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he reached out for Madelyn's butt again, Alexander intervened, gripping Janus' hand firmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ow!" Janus yelped, wincing in pain. "Let go! It hurts..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's grip remained steady, making it clear that such behavior was unacceptable.</span></p><div class="pagination">
