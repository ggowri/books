  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Paula often watched adult films and knew Keith's true identity. She admired him greatly, which was why she eagerly added him as a friend.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Naturally, Paula became the target Keith planned to seduce. Through her, he could find Cyclops.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this time of day, regardless of gender, everyone was full of energy and struggling with their own loneliness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Keith said with a playful smile, "Ms. Ortiz, I really miss you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As he chatted with Paula over a video call, he dressed, his handsome face carrying an expression that was a mix of decadence and casual charm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ah, Mr. Robinson, do you like me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Paula giggled on the other end of the screen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She was ten years younger than Chaalis and far more beautiful. With a delicate face and captivating eyes, her features were strikingly attractive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her nose was well-defined, and her lips were plump, adding to her sensual appeal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Paula's most enticing quality was her fiery and seductive figure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She wore a black and revealing nightdress that was so short. It exposed her beautiful rear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was obvious that Paula was deliberately trying to seduce Keith.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When a lonely man and woman with mutual attraction engage in a video call, it was clear that they were looking for excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon, they stopped exchanging pleasantries and began teasing each other with crude language.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Paula even deliberately exposed a large portion of her chest, occasionally flashing glimpses beneath her skirt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Keith was honestly surprised. Paula's behavior was much more eager than he had expected.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He had initially planned to take his time courting her, but before he could even start, Paula had already grown impatient and was thoroughly enjoying the attention.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Keith thought for a moment and understood. After all, the leader who liked her was quite old, probably old enough to be her grandfather.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Not that using the magic powder, he could not satisfy a young woman like Paula whose desires were insatiable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With that, Keith relaxed, deciding to learn more about Paula.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If he wanted to rise in Sakra Society, he had to understand Paula better and win her over. She could speak up for him in front of that leader.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Paula, seeing that Keith wanted to get to know her better, was thrilled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Other men only ever seemed interested in her body, and no one had ever taken the time to care about her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Once she opened up, she couldn't stop. She spilled all of her past, telling Keith everything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It turned out that Paula had once been married. Her husband worked as a doctor at a hospital.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Because of her husband, they lived comfortably, and their marriage was happy and fulfilling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But one day, her husband made a medical mistake and was fired.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Unable to handle the blow, he spiraled into addiction to gambling and drugs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before long, he died from the effects of his addiction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Paula had a strong sexual desire and a masochistic streak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She had married when she was just twenty, but four years later, her husband passed away, leaving her in her prime and ravenous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her husband had been strong and full of energy. And every night, he would exhaust her with his insatiable desire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In just a few short years, Paula's body had been thoroughly explored.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When her desire reached its peak, her husband died.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With no support left, she soon found herself at a bar, seeking satisfaction with various men, trading sex for both money and pleasure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Later, she met Decker Payne, one of the leaders of Sakra Society.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Decker was an old and once-powerful leader of Sakra Society. Although he no longer held power, his reputation was still strong.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He had plenty of money to support Paula's lavish lifestyle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before long, Paula had fallen into his bed, and she began to enjoy the forbidden thrill of being with a man old enough to be her grandfather.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But over time, while Decker provided for her financially, Paula's physical needs remained unfulfilled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even with the help of magic powder, Decker couldn't bring Paula the satisfaction she craved.</span></p><div class="pagination">
