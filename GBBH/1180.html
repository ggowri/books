  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfred obviously did not believe it and sarcastically said through gritted teeth, "Kid, did you pretend to call Mr. Chapman? If you want to scare me, you should act a bit better. Do you think I would believe your nonsense?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, Alfred's phone rang. When he saw the number, he was instantly overjoyed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My dad is calling me. Cloe, just wait. I guarantee that in the future, your ships won't be able to enter </span><span>Louvian</span><span> Port."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He immediately answered the call and switched it to speaker mode.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Brat, what did you do on Treasure Island?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The furious voice erupted as soon as he picked up the phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfred was taken aback and said, "Dad, I didn't do anything."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His father roared, "You didn't do anything? Then why did Mr. Chapman revoke my position and demand that I hand over all my shares? He said you offended someone important on Treasure Island.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"When you come back, I'll definitely skin you alive."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Alfred could say anything else, the call was already disconnected.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone fell silent, stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Cloe hadn't expected that Alexander needed only one phone call to have a senior executive from Sunrise Group dismissed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who exactly are you?" Alfred stammered as he asked Alexander, his expression terrified and desperate, losing all his previous arrogance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander coldly regarded Alfred, his gaze filled with disdain and disregard, even unwilling to respond.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cloe and the others felt a powerful aura emanating from Alexander as if he were looking down on them, instilling fear in their hearts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfred, unwilling to concede, said, "If you're so impressive, why don't you dare reveal your name?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander didn't even glance at Alfred, voice icy as he replied, "You're not worthy to know my name. Get out of Treasure Island quickly, or I'll have someone throw you into the sea to feed the sharks."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those murderous words frightened Alfred, making him tremble all over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He, along with a few followers, left in disgrace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The hall manager appeared somewhat pale and quickly said, "Everyone, your dishes are ready."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander ignored him, turning his attention to several young women dressed in palace gowns who emerged carrying trays.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As pleasant music played, they gracefully lined up, bringing the trays forward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There </span><span>were</span><span> a total of four dishes, one soup, and a bottle of fine wine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The aroma wafted towards them. The presentation of these dishes was exquisite and clearly crafted with care.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander glanced over and nodded, thinking, "This descendant of the royal chef does have some skill."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The dishes, accompanied by antique high-end porcelain plates, were quite elegant and pleasing to the eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, the enticing aroma made one's mouth water.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smiled and said, "It seems Mr. Clement intentionally made us wait so long for a reason. Once a person is hungry, everything tastes good. Everyone, dig in."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was the first to taste the food carefully. Although the dishes tasted good, he still frowned slightly because his perception was far superior to everyone else present.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While others couldn't notice the flaws, he could tell that these dishes didn't seem to be as perfect as rumored.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander concluded that Dulles Clement was a marketing genius. He initially created expectations in the guests by claiming his ancestors were royal chefs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once the guests arrived and found they couldn't order their own meals and had to accept what was served, feelings of uncertainty and anticipation arose.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>People had a certain awe and expectation for what they couldn't control.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Additionally, the prolonged wait not only whetted everyone's appetite but also made them think the food tasted particularly delicious due to their hunger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Delicious."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Truly worthy of being a descendant of a royal chef."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>William and Logan ate with their mouths full, praising the meal profusely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander remained silent, sampling a bit of each dish before silently putting down his fork.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Boss, what's wrong? Do you think it doesn't taste good?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cloe noticed Alexander's actions and felt a bit uneasy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smiled and shook his head, "It's nothing. The taste is decent, but not as good as I imagined."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The hall manager couldn't help but murmur, "But those are dishes made by Mr. Clement. So far, there haven't been any negative reviews. You must not have tasted truly delicious food before."</span></p><div class="pagination">
