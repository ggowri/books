Wait... could she be Norma Walsh, the leader of the Dragon Gang?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were stunned. The massive luxury yacht, combined with the name Norma, confirmed the identity of the stunning woman before them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even the Sakra Society couldn't bail them out now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, a long convoy of cars sped toward them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Over a dozen black sedans screeched to a halt just a few feet away from Alexander and Norma.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dozens of men in black suits jumped out of the cars, shouting loudly, "Boss, we're here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Norma waved her hand coldly. "Arrest them all. Inform their families to pay for their release."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She really was the Dragon Gang's boss!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The unlucky men deflated like punctured balloons. Their last slivers of hope shattered as they obediently allowed themselves to be herded into the cars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander and Norma boarded the Rolls-Royce and drove off, bathed in the golden glow of the setting sun.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By the next day, news of a major clash between the Dragon Gang and the Sakra Society at the docks spread across </span><span>Kylaville</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yinson was still dressed in a white katana robe, leaning back in his executive chair with a cold expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A bald middle-aged man stood timidly before Yinson.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. White, my son Matteo has been..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Silence!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before the man could finish his sentence, Yinson cut him off harshly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yinson said icily, "I've warned you all before&mdash;do not engage the Dragon Gang openly for now. Your son dared to publicly harass Norma. Wasn't he asking for trouble?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Norma has unified the Dragon Gang. She's no pushover."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The bald man was unwilling to give up and muttered under his breath, "Mr. White, if we don't act, everyone in </span><span>Kylaville</span><span> will think the Sakra Society is scared of the Dragon Gang."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How dare you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yinson slammed the table and strode toward the bald man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Care to repeat that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The bald man bowed his head deeply and didn't dare say another word.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get out!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yinson kicked him hard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The bald man left with a sullen expression, not daring to say anything else.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The room fell silent until Elaine swayed her hips as she walked out, leaning coquettishly against Yinson.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. White, don't get angry! Getting upset over those idiots isn't worth it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmph!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yinson sank heavily back into his chair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"These idiots only know how to mess things up. Right now, we're at a critical juncture of the Apocalypse Project. We can't engage the Dragon Gang head-on."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's a shame the assassination attempt failed. Not even the shark could take her down."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sean turned out to be a useless idiot, killed by a woman. But that only proves how extraordinary she is."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elaine, with a serious expression, reminded him, "Mr. White, I think there's something off about Ramirez's death!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even with Norma's strength, there's no way she could overpower Sean and take control of the entire family overnight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's why I suspect someone is secretly supporting Norma!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yinson frowned. He hadn't considered this possibility and had assumed it was just internal strife within the Dragon Gang.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After pondering for a moment, he commanded, "Investigate and find out who's backing Norma."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Understood, Mr. White!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elaine bowed deeply, her ample chest fully exposed and trembling slightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Yinson showed no reaction as he glanced at her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Truth be told, he was starting to grow tired of this seductive woman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Elaine weren't the leader of the Apocalypse Project, Yinson would've replaced her by now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Keith was filming a risqu&eacute; domestic drama.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Keith was the lead actor, accompanied by a supporting actor. Both were dressed in repairman uniforms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knocked on a door, followed by two cameras recording the scene.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lilian, the lead actress, opened the door, her delicate face glowing with a bright smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sorry for the delay. Are you here to fix the pipes?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Following the script, Keith smirked and let his gaze wander lecherously over Lilian's voluptuous figure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her short skirt clung to her curves, highlighting her full chest and hips, making her look incredibly alluring.</span></p><div class="pagination">
