  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What are you thinking?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander realized that he was daydreaming. He stopped thinking about that and asked Max to call medical staff to come and give Cloe a blood transfusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Max was more respectful to Alexander than to Cloe. The scene of Alexander killing Guzman just now shocked everyone present.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Cloe was carried away by medical staff, Alexander, led by Max, walked through a corridor and came to the suite at the end, which was Guzman's bedroom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Max was waiting outside obediently, and Alexander pushed the door open and went in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The light in the bedroom was dim, and Alexander could vaguely see two naked women lying on the bed in the middle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Bryant, you are finally back. We have been waiting for you for a long time."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The beautiful sisters thought it was Guzman who came back, and immediately came to hug the man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The older sister touched Alexander's lower abdomen coquettishly and suddenly screamed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander turned on all the lights in the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He saw a circle of bruises on the older sister's right wrist. It was left by Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You! Who are you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were trembling with fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander looked at the two girls. They were both in their prime, with plump, sexy, and well-proportioned figures.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their breasts were unusually big and their buttocks were round. Their long white legs were eye-catching.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Alexander, who was used to seeing beautiful women, couldn't help but be attracted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you are obedient, I won't hurt you. Otherwise, I promise you will be in big trouble."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander warned coldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two girls were not fools. No one had ever dared to break in here. Alexander's appearance meant that something must have happened to Guzman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I am Lesly Bligh. This is Aliza Bligh, my elder sister. Please don't kill us. As long as you don't hurt us, we can cooperate with you in whatever you want to do... Anything is fine..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aliza pressed her body tightly against Alexander's, squeezing and rubbing rhythmically, while her slender fingers gently stroked his chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lesly quickly kneeled in front of Alexander, grabbed his belt, and untied it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Um!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander couldn't help but groan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As long as a man was normal, no one could resist the temptation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, Alexander had just experienced a thrilling killing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Facing the sneak attack from the Nine-Headed Snake Party and Guzman, Alexander felt a sense of crisis and was under tremendous psychological pressure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He needed to vent as well. Lesly and Aliza seized the opportunity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander picked up Aliza, threw her onto the bed, and pressed down on her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lesly was surprised and happy. She was happy because as long as Alexander could </span><span>accept them, they would be safe. She was surprised because Alexander looked so strong and scary.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She did not hesitate at all. She hugged Alexander from behind and kissed him, making Alexander experience unprecedented pleasure for the first time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, seductive moans sounded in the bedroom...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Max and a few of his men stood guard at the door in an orderly manner, not daring to relax or show any dissatisfaction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They all knew that Alexander was the real boss of the Brilliant Group, and Cloe was just Alexander's agent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It took more than an hour for the noise in the room to disappear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Max and others had complicated expressions and communicated with their eye contact. They thought, "Alexander was not only good at Force skills but also strong in the masculine aspect."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, Lesly and Aliza had been completely conquered by Alexander. They hugged him on both sides, as docile as well-behaved kittens.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was also more relaxed than ever before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava and Lara were all staying with Alexander alone each time, so Alexander could only suppress his feelings, otherwise they would not be able to bear it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander sighed secretly. There were more and more women around him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He asked, "Aliza, do you know where Guzman hides the good stuff?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aliza said quickly, "Let me think about it. I'll think about it carefully."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then she got up naked, ran into the inner room, and began to rummage through the drawers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For a moment, her plump breasts and round buttocks swayed continuously, which made Alexander's desire rise again.</span></p><div class="pagination">
