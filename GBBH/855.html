  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone knew the rules of the casino&mdash;cheating meant losing a hand or a foot. Forcing Benjamin to sever just one arm was already considered lenient.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The once boisterous hall fell silent, tension thick in the air. Shock, anticipation, and a twisted kind of excitement danced in the onlookers' eyes as they shifted their gazes between Alexander and Benjamin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Benjamin's face was grim, his bloodshot eyes betraying his inner turmoil. Yet, he didn't dare resist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Don't worry. I lost. I'll follow the rules," Benjamin said through gritted teeth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander sneered. "Having second thoughts? Need me to get someone to help you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His voice was calm, but the sharp glint in his eyes sent a chill down Benjamin's spine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Suddenly, Benjamin's mind clouded, his thoughts overtaken by Alexander's Force Control. In that moment, resistance was not an option. If Alexander had told him to kneel, he would have done it without hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With trembling hands, Benjamin picked up the dagger. He brought it down hard on his left wrist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Blood sprayed across the floor as his severed hand fell with a sickening thud.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gasps and screams erupted from the crowd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Some women covered their eyes, unable to stomach the sight, while others turned away, pale-faced.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clutching his bleeding arm, Benjamin's twisted face contorted with rage. "You... don't get too cocky, kid. Just wait. I'll come for you again!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander's gaze was icy. "You won't get the chance in this lifetime. Now, get out."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With that, he delivered a sharp kick, sending Benjamin sprawling to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Benjamin screamed in pain as he scrambled to his feet and fled, his retreating figure leaving a trail of blood in its wake.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marvin leaned in, whispering, "Boss, want me to finish him off? Might save us trouble later."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander watched Benjamin's retreat with a cold smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Not necessary," he replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Unbeknownst to everyone, Alexander's Force Control had ensured that Benjamin severed his own hand as part of an elaborate act. Letting Benjamin return to Sean as a wounded pawn would serve Alexander's plans far better.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Just then, Norma approached with a group of her staff, her face glowing with admiration and excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne, thank you so much. That was incredible!" she exclaimed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her eyes held a mix of gratitude and awe. This man wasn't just handsome&mdash;he was a force to be reckoned with.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Norma couldn't help but feel lucky. If she hadn't brought Alexander on board, Sean would have crushed her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The mere thought of Sean made her blood boil. Her resolve hardened&mdash;she would rely on Alexander to take Sean down, even if it meant paying a steep price.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>For Norma, no price was too high&mdash;even her own innocence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Blushing slightly, she looked at Alexander and said shyly, "Mr. Hawthorne, I didn't expect you to defeat Benjamin so effortlessly. You're incredible. From today, I'd like to officially appoint you as the senior advisor to our casino."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gasps rippled through the Dragon Gang members. The position of senior advisor was an exclusive role&mdash;one never given to outsiders. It came with immense authority and annual dividends worth hundreds of millions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Norma turned to the room, clapping her hands. "Everyone, let's welcome Mr. Hawthorne as our new senior advisor!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The hall erupted in applause, the sound echoing off the walls.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Norma bowed slightly, addressing the crowd with a charming smile. "I apologize for interrupting tonight's enjoyment. To make it up to you, every guest here will receive $200 in complimentary chips. Please enjoy the rest of your evening!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Cheers erupted again as the crowd celebrated both the spectacle and their unexpected windfall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Norma, her hips swaying with practiced grace, walked up to Alexander and boldly linked her arm through his.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne, congratulations on your victory. From now on, you're officially the second-ranked gambling king in the world," she said, her tone sweet and flirtatious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her sparkling eyes locked onto his, practically brimming with admiration and intrigue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander chuckled inwardly. Was she already smitten with him? Sometimes, his charm felt more like a curse than a gift.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Miss Walsh," Alexander said with a knowing smile, "you promised to sell me all the iridium collected by the Dragon Gang. That deal still stands, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Norma nodded without hesitation, her voice firm. "Of course! Not only will I sell it to you, but I'll do it at half the price."</span></p><div class="pagination">
