  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Keith was lying on the ground when he noticed a shadow cast over him. Someone was approaching.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Do you want to rise above the crowd? Do you want the top ten actresses to bow to you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander's voice broke the silence, his deep eyes glinting with an unusual light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Yes! That's my dream, and I'll make it come true!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Keith nodded vigorously. He couldn't explain why, but this man, who appeared to be about the same age as him, exuded an irresistible charisma.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The sunlight streamed in from behind Alexander, making him look almost like a god descended to earth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If I help you achieve your dream, are you willing to submit to me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander asked in an even tone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Keith hesitated for a moment and then looked at Alexander with suspicion. "Who are you? Why would you want to help me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You don't need to know why. Just kneel and swear your loyalty to me, and I'll help you fulfill your wish."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander replied with an air of absolute confidence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Keith was bewildered. He thought, "Who is this guy?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He seems kind of unreliable. Maybe he's a lunatic?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Or is he just bored and messing with me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before he could react further, Marvin grabbed him by the collar and growled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Keith, do you recognize me? Are you stupid? When Sir tells you to kneel, you kneel! Call him Sir, and you'll benefit from it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Cousin? What are you doing here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Keith stared at Marvin in shock, unable to believe his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marvin slapped him. "Cut the nonsense and get on your knees!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He pressed Keith down until he was kneeling in front of Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Keith, now genuinely frightened, stammered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Why are you doing this? What's in it for you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"In it for me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander smiled and said plainly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I only want your unwavering loyalty. You'll be my pawn in Azuran. Helping you rise above others is merely my gift to you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'll ask you one last time. Are you willing?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander's penetrating gaze locked onto Keith, a strange light flashing in his deep eyes, causing Keith's mind to blur.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Keith was just an ordinary person. He couldn't possibly resist Alexander's psychic control using the Force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I swear my loyalty to you! I'll serve you, no matter the cost!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Keith's voice trembled as he knelt straight before Alexander, bowing respectfully without daring to look up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander nodded in satisfaction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Good. From now on, your life is mine. Unless I want you dead, even death won't take you. And if you dare betray me, you won't have to worry about me. Your cousin will take care of you himself."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marvin's cold glare and the murderous vibe he exuded made Keith shudder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Keith turned pale with fright, cold sweat dripping down his back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Let's go. We're heading to Dragon Gang!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander commanded, turning to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Keith remained frozen, muttering to himself, "Could he be a high-ranking leader in the Dragon Gang?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What are you spacing out for? Move!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marvin gave him a shove.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Dragon Gang? Are we really going there? Does this mean... I might actually achieve my dream?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Keith's excitement bubbled over as he quickly followed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, he felt his heart filled with strength, joy, and excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Relax. I told you I'd help you achieve your dream, and I will."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander said casually, even without turning his head. He knew what Keith was thinking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Thank you, Sir... Thank you..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Keith's face flushed with excitement, his words stumbling as he struggled to contain his emotions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He followed closely behind Alexander, watching his graceful figure, his confident stride, and his commanding presence, once again deeply amazed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "No wonder even someone like my cousin is completely obedient to him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Keith's heart was filled with awe and admiration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Submission to strength was deeply ingrained in the Risun people's culture, and Keith was no exception.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>What's more, Alexander had used the Force of psychic control on him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Is this the Dragon Gang's headquarters?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander stopped in front of a towering skyscraper over a hundred stories tall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Sir, ordinary people can't get in there. What should we do now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Keith asked cautiously.</span></p><div class="pagination">
