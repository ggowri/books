Alexander kicked him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That man flew out and fell heavily to the ground without consciousness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander </span><span>destroyed</span><span> one of them with </span><span>just </span><span>one kick. His ferocity immediately intimidated everyone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After realizing his power, they became hesitant to attack but refused to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dude, this woman </span><span>got in big trouble! </span><span>We're from the Ultimate Alliance, and </span><span>our boss </span><span>Alexander Hawthorne</span><span> likes her!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>I suggest you give me that woman and stay out of</span><span> it</span><span>," one of the robust men threatened Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're from the Ultimate Alliance and under the order of your boss' command to bring this woman back?" Alexander felt speechless and doubted if they were frauds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You've known our identity, and the Ultimate Alliance masters the entire Loscity. Don't push your luck!" That robust man glared at Alexander with a distorted expression of rage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Honey, I know you are an expert at fighting. Don't be afraid. Just kick their ass</span><span>es</span><span>, and I'll make you feel so good at night</span><span>...</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Th</span><span>is</span><span> woman </span><span>used her sweet voice to </span><span>beg Alexander and shook Alexander's arm while pressing her </span><span>big boobs</span><span> against his body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her watery eyes were full of temptation</span><span>. S</span><span>he </span><span>was clearly </span><span>seduc</span><span>ing</span><span> Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Alexander could </span><span>tell</span><span> that this </span><span>cunning</span><span> woman just planned to make him fight for her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, he said coldly, </span><span>"Young lady</span><span>, don't show off your acting skills.</span><span> You're not so good at acting.</span><span> </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>If you want me to help you, just tell me how you messed up with these guys."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's</span><span> about</span><span> Alexander Hawthorne</span><span>.</span><span> The boss of the Ultimate Alliance wants to have sex with me, but I don't want to, so I have no choice..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she sobbed, she hugged Alexander even harder and rubbed her sexy body against his, which would be too titillating for any man to resist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Alexander just </span><span>smiled</span><span> and said, "</span><span>Liar</span><span>. Alright, since you don't want to tell </span><span>me </span><span>the truth, don't blame me for</span><span> taking</span><span> you</span><span> later</span><span>.</span><span> You asked for it.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had just made a breakthrough as an Advanced Warrior and wanted to make out with Ava to solidify his power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, this woman delayed his plan, and she would have to be responsible for that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The very thing he intended to figure out was whether these </span><span>guys</span><span> were from the Ultimate Alliance or not and why they bullied a woman in his name.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, honey, I'm yours. As long as you can help me get rid of these </span><span>annoying assholes</span><span>, I can do anything for you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She knew he was a good fighter and left everything behind except for clutching the life-saving straw.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a timid and worried face, she seemed to shed tears of sadness and fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Alexander could </span><span>tell</span><span> that she was </span><span>lowering her head and </span><span>snickering.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you done? </span><span>Brat, get lost! O</span><span>r we will </span><span>kick</span><span> your ass!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah! She's our boss' woman. You better disappear now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All of them shouted at Alexander impatiently. As they outnumbered him, they were not afraid of this young man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>You're asking me to get lost? So funny! </span><span>You're dead </span><span>meat </span><span>now</span><span>! E</span><span>ven if you </span><span>guys </span><span>really come from the Ultimate Alliance</span><span>, no one can save you!</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They really irritated Alexander. Betty once disciplined the Ultimate Alliance before, but he didn't expect such an outrageous thing</span><span>. S</span><span>ome scamps actually used his name to harass a woman in public. He had to investigate the whole matter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since such chaos ruined his good mood when heading home, he could only vent his anger on these idiots.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Guys, kick his ass!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A hefty man waved his hand and led his men to pounce at Alexander like a pack of hyenas.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They knew he was good at fighting, so they had to attack together and were confident in beating Alexander up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fuck off!" Alexander directly slapped the one who rushed the fastest to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a </span><span>bang</span><span>, that man flew out and knocked over one of his teammates.</span></p><div class="pagination">
