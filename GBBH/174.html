  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava and Lara exchanged startled glances, taken aback by Alexander's willingness to spend money.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was 100 million dollars!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The murmurs among the crowd grew louder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sure, it's a top-notch gem, but 100 million? That's just ridiculous. I'm out..." one bidder lamented, shaking his head in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ha! This guy thinks he's hot stuff just because of that magic powder. He's got the look of a nouveau riche."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Honestly, he's just trying to make a name for himself in our elite circles. Deep down, he knows he's from the bottom rung and is probably terrified that we won't accept him," someone else chimed in, their tone laced with jealousy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While they all had money, the idea of casually dropping 100 million on a gem that wasn't even worth that much was laughable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>David remained silent, his bidding paddle trembling in his hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All eyes turned to him, some filled with a twisted sense of schadenfreude.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"One hundred million and 100 thousand!" he finally gritted out, raising his paddle with a defiant flick of his wrist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd gasped; nobody expected David to raise the bid again, but it was clear he was feeling the pressure&mdash;only adding 100 thousand showed his uncertainty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"One hundred and one million!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander shot </span><span>back,</span><span> his confidence unwavering.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was determined to get that gem, no matter the cost.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>David shot up from his seat, glaring at Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you even have that kind of cash? Don't use your girlfriend's money!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander merely laughed, a dismissive sound that echoed through the room. "David, quit your whining. If you can't keep up, just admit defeat."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Oscar quickly intervened, "Mr. Federer, let's keep it civil. No need for personal attacks; it's just an auction."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>David's face flushed crimson. With so many eyes on him, he felt the weight of his position as a senior member of the Federer family and a state senator. He couldn't afford to lose face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"One hundred and three million!" he blurted out, surprisingly raising his bid by two million, shocking everyone in the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"One hundred and ten million!" Alexander countered, his voice firm and commanding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A collective gasp rippled through the audience.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All eyes were glued to Alexander, their expressions a mix of awe and disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This gem, which was realistically worth around 60 or 70 million, was now nearing double that price.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In their mind, Alexander, with his magic powder, was practically throwing money around to make a name for himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, David fell silent, his face a mask of frustration as he slumped back into his seat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, a silver-haired elder strode into the room, a genial smile plastered on his face as he approached Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne, I'm Gary Federer, head of the Federer family. How about you let us have this gem? We'll remember your generosity."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gary, as the head of the Federer family, knew he had to uphold their dignity at this moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wow, the head of the Federer family is here? Things are getting interesting!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Gary's all about reputation. If the Federer family doesn't snag this gem today, they'll be the laughingstock of the town."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sure, Alexander has that magic powder, but the Federer family is one of the top four families in </span><span>Loscity</span><span>. Their resources are beyond </span><span>compare</span><span>."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Exactly, I've heard the Federer family has deep ties with that Godfather known as SATAN."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing the chatter around him, Gary couldn't help but smile smugly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was clear he relished the respect the Federer family commanded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is getting tricky..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava and Lara frowned, realizing the significance of the moment. With the head of one of the top four families involved, they knew this was no ordinary auction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander remained unfazed, bowing slightly as he replied, "I'm afraid I can't part with this gem.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's mine to claim."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gary's expression darkened immediately, his voice turning icy. "Alexander, while you may have the magic powder formula at your fingertips, you should understand the old </span><span>saying: 'A man with treasure is often in danger.'</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can guarantee you that there are more than a couple of powerful factions eyeing that formula. Given the circumstances, do you really want to make an enemy of the Federer family?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And let me remind you, I offered you a favor&mdash;our family's goodwill is worth far more than a mere stone."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He spoke with fervor, his head held high, radiating authority and pride.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander stood his ground, his demeanor calm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I appreciate the offer, but I have no need for your favor. If you're willing to take a step back today, I'd be more than happy to consider extending a courtesy to the Federer family."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gary's face flushed with anger. "Alexander, how dare you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The tension in the room was palpable, as if the very air had thickened. Everyone held their breath, caught in the charged atmosphere between the two men.</span></p><div class="pagination">
