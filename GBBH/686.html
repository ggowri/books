  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Staggs, those two beauties are stunning. I don't think they're part of our 'Reaper' crew, are they?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One man asked Levi with a sly grin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their gazes lingered over Rosalia and Charlize, lingering especially on their curves, practically drooling with desire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"All the better if they're not from our organization. They seem skilled enough; imagine all the moves they could pull off in bed."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Levi </span><span>smirked,</span><span> his gaze filled with desire as he looked at them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was at the buffet, calmly enjoying his meal, entirely unfazed by the chatter around him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Has that guy never seen food before? With two such stunning women by his side, and all he does is eat? What a waste."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't recognize him, but he's definitely not one of our top members. It's annoying just looking at him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Exactly. It's a crime to waste such beauties on him. I'm going over there to win one of them over. He probably won't dare say a word."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A middle-aged man finally couldn't hold back and strode confidently toward Rosalia and Charlize, flashing a charming smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ladies, would I be fortunate enough to buy you a drink?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He asked smoothly, clearly practiced at approaching women.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosalia and Charlize acted as if they hadn't even heard him, ignoring him entirely, as though it were the air itself speaking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A look of irritation flashed across the man's face, but he wasn't one to give up easily. </span><span>Moving closer, he tried again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ladies, my name is Lucas Grylls. Would either of you honor me with a dance?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lucas' tone held a note of politeness as he bowed slightly, exuding the air of a gentleman from another era.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosalia gave him a frosty glance, replying icily, "We're not interested. Please go find someone else and don't disturb us."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Charlize rolled her eyes with open disdain. "Look at yourself in a mirror and see if you're even worth our time."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laughter erupted from nearby, adding insult to the sting of Lucas' rejection.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're being rude!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lucas snapped, humiliated and on the verge of losing his temper.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come on, ladies, you can't give me a little face? Just one dance from one of you, and I'll leave you alone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"After all, we're part of the same organization. There's no need to make things unpleasant, is there?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lucas restrained his anger and made one last attempt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Charlize sneered. "You think you're capable of making things difficult for us?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosalia, even colder, said bluntly, "Arrogant fool. Get lost."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lucas' face contorted with fury. As a skilled martial artist and a key member of the organization, he wasn't used to being rejected so publicly, especially in front of his laughing companions. This humiliation was too much to bear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unable to contain his rage any longer, he pointed at Alexander, who was still calmly enjoying his food, and demanded, "Is that glutton your man? This guy?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laughter erupted through the room, loud and mocking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lucas had crossed the line, and Alexander had no intention of backing down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Truthfully, Alexander had found Lucas' advances amusing to watch and hadn't intervened when he initially approached Rosalia and Charlize.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, with the last piece of roasted meat from his plate in his mouth, Alexander wiped his hands leisurely with a napkin and finally rose to face Lucas.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as Alexander turned toward him, Lucas lunged, moving to strike without warning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The air ripped as Lucas thrust a gleaming knife toward Alexander's arm with alarming speed, the blade catching the light with a deadly glint.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander scoffed. This guy had a death wish.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Back off!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He bellowed, channeling the Force with pinpoint precision, piercing Lucas' right hand like a needle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lucas screamed in agony, dropping the knife as blood oozed from a hole in his hand as thick as a finger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The room fell silent in shock. Everyone knew Lucas had been a champion underground fighter, and yet Alexander had taken him down with a single move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander stood unfazed, his gaze steely and cold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"So, you tried to ambush me just because your little flirting attempt failed?"</span></p><div class="pagination">
