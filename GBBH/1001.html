  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Something went wrong! Someone must have tampered with the magic powder through Julian and distributed the tainted product to agents across surrounding counties and cities," Ava said, her face dark with frustration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was a catastrophe. Resolving it without major repercussions would be nearly impossible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She grabbed her phone and called Alexander directly, skipping any mention of Grace and diving straight into the crisis.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, I'll be there immediately," Alexander replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had been in the middle of his Force training but dropped everything and rushed to the Brilliant Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The magic powder causing side effects? Someone's pulling strings. This can't be a coincidence, Alexander thought grimly as the pieces started coming together.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If his hunch was correct, the Vance family was behind it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Ava hung up, another employee burst into the room, drenched in sweat and panting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Blackburn, it's getting worse! The crowd outside is growing by the minute. We're barely holding them back!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They're demanding explanations, compensation, and for the person responsible to be brought to justice. There are hundreds of them gathering outside, right in front of the building."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava didn't hesitate. "Alright. I'll go out and address them myself."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the president of Brilliant Group, she couldn't hide in the shadows while her company faced such a massive issue. She had to step up and face it head-on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before she could leave, loud shouts erupted outside. The crowd had stormed into the building, packing the corridor with an angry mob.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The protestors waved banners branding the magic powder as poison and accusing the Brilliant Group of being ruthless profiteers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Security guards formed a barricade, holding the mob at bay and preventing them from storming into the president's office.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Step aside! We're not here for you unless you're defending these crooks!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get Ava out here! She's the one we want to deal with!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Brilliant Group needs to pay for our losses, and whoever's responsible must face justice!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The fierce expressions on the protestors' faces were intimidating, their anger palpable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Everyone, calm down. I'm Elliot Beaumont, Alexander's uncle. Alexander is the one who developed the magic powder. I'm here to resolve this issue."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd's shouts quieted as a bald, portly man pushed his way forward. His expression was serious, but a glint of malice lurked in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The formula actually belongs to the Beaumont family," Elliot announced solemnly. "Alexander stole it and profited from our hard work. But don't worry&mdash;I'm here to make things right. I'll take back what belongs to us and ensure you all get the compensation you deserve."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a few supporters flanking him, Elliot strode toward Ava with an air of arrogance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing that Elliot was Alexander's uncle, the security guards hesitated and parted to let him through.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ava!" Elliot barked as he approached. "Hand over Alexander! You stole the formula from the Beaumont family and caused this chaos!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava studied him carefully. Alexander's uncle? she thought. The man who didn't even attend his own sister's memorial suddenly shows up now, making accusations about a stolen formula?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her sharp mind quickly connected the dots. The Vance family has to be involved. This isn't just about the Brilliant Group; they're after the formula as well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava's jaw tightened. She knew this was more than an attack on her company&mdash;it was a calculated move to trap both Alexander and the Brilliant Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She glanced at the chaos outside, the furious mob, and Elliot's smug grin. For the first time in a long while, she desperately wished Alexander were there. His presence would bring the calm and authority she needed in this storm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliot's eyes gleamed with greed as he surveyed the room. "Bring Alexander here. I'll take the formula back from him myself, and then the Brilliant Group will compensate </span><span>everyone for their losses."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava's lip curled into a sneer. "You claim Alexander stole the formula? Then show your proof. Don't think you can take us down by teaming up with the Vance family. We're not falling for it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliot smirked, his tone dripping with malice. "Ava, look around. These people have been harmed because of your company's negligence. Do you really think you can talk your way out of this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd surged forward again, shouting angrily at Ava.</span></p><div class="pagination">
