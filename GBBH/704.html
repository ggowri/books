  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Heinrich, supported by two bodyguards, stepped down from the helicopter and strode to the center of the plaza.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shadow immediately led his subordinates in a deep bow, their voices ringing out in unison.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Welcome, Godfather!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cloe and the members of the Brilliant Group were startled to discover that this frail older man was their Godfather.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Welcome, Godfather!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone bowed their heads except for Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Heinrich gave Alexander a gentle smile and announced in a clear voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"From this moment forward, I declare Alexander as my sole heir. The title of 'Reaper' will also pass to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Make me proud, son," he said, patting Alexander's shoulder before walking back to the helicopter without a backward glance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander stood there with mixed emotions, watching Heinrich's lonely yet dignified figure. He opened his mouth to speak but thought better of it and remained silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The plaza fell into complete silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone was stunned, including the Red Umbrella Group's captives and representatives from various minor factions on Treasure Island.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This announcement completely floored them!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He's becoming the Godfather's heir at such a young age? We're talking about the Reaper here, a name that stands shoulder to shoulder with the Mafia, SATAN, and the Godfather!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You don't know the half of it. At last night's banquet, Mr. Hawthorne took down Levi and his whole crew single-handedly."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you guys blind? Didn't you just see how insanely powerful Mr. Hawthorne is?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The whispers spread through the crowd as they gazed at Alexander with a mixture of awe and fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shadow dropped to one knee before Alexander and made a solemn vow with utmost gravity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne, I swear my loyalty to you. I'll follow you through hell and high water, whatever it takes!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Augusta, William, Rosalia, and Charlize quickly followed suit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne, I swear my loyalty to you. I'll follow you through hell and high water, whatever it takes!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cloe rushed to lead everyone else in kneeling, and they all shouted in unison, "Mr. Hawthorne, I swear my loyalty to you. I'll follow you through hell and high water, whatever it takes!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The battle for the Godfather position was settled. The fate of Treasure Island was decided. Alexander, as the sole heir, had taken control of everything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander strode toward the Red Umbrella Group's captives, with Shadow and others following close behind, their presence radiating overwhelming power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He asked simply, "Will you submit?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though the question seemed essential, Alexander had activated his Force Control. His voice resonated at an otherworldly frequency, washing over them like a tidal wave, infiltrating their minds and weakening their resolve.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Please spare us, Mr. Hawthorne..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The captives dropped to the ground one after another, pressing their foreheads to the floor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Someone tried to resist, but Alexander's piercing glare sent them reeling. Their vision blurred, consciousness wavering, as they crumpled to their knees.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's power had grown immense. The Red Umbrella Group members, already shaken to their core, found their mental defenses crumbling. Their submission was absolute.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander turned to Cloe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm relocating Ultimate Alliance's headquarters here. On paper, Treasure Island will remain under the Brilliant Group, but in reality, it'll belong to Ultimate Alliance."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cloe quickly responded, "Yes, Mr. Hawthorne!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her eyes were red-rimmed as she gazed at him, her watery eyes full of longing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander knew what was on her mind. He'd been neglecting her lately, but with so many people around, all he could do was clear his throat awkwardly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosalia and Charlize exchanged knowing looks. Their female intuition told them there was definitely something going on between Cloe and Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What a player," Charlize muttered under her breath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosalia quickly nudged her, signaling her to watch her words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander pretended not to hear and asked Cloe about Treasure Island's recent operations.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne, the Red Umbrella Group's headquarters has a secret vault. According to our inside sources, it contains over ten billion dollars in cash."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I suspect there are other valuable items in there too, but we'll need to do a full inventory," Cloe reported dutifully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Felix sure knows how to rake it in!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander mused before ordering, "Pick trustworthy people yourself to locate the vault. Clean it out thoroughly and report back to me."</span></p><div class="pagination">
