  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though Brittany's movements were clumsy, they brought him a sense of excitement and conquest that no other woman's movements could match.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He caressed her beautiful body tenderly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brittany was so excited that she couldn't speak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Alexander caressed her, her breasts became more and more towering. And the pink peaks were surrounded by tiny protruding grains.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, touch me..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brittany begged shyly and responded actively.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had put the preferences of her beloved man above her own dignity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was full of conquest. It was great to have such a woman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mature women were also good, but they had been exploited by men long ago, otherwise, they would not have such skilled techniques. They would kneel down obediently and would know how to suck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Brittany was different. Alexander enjoyed the pleasure of training a beautiful young woman by himself. The pleasure was incomparable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said, "Brittany, I hope you won't regret it in the future. If one day you regret it, tell me and I will give you your freedom and a large sum of money as compensation."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander promised solemnly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brittany said, "No! Absolutely not. I will be yours for the rest of my life."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brittany was extremely determined. She lowered her head and learned to suck and stroke in a clumsy way...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was tall and muscular. When he held Brittany in his arms, they looked like a beast and a beauty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He pressed on Brittany and began to move. Brittany cried with happiness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>More than an hour later, everything returned to calm. It was already evening.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brittany had tears in her eyes. She snuggled in Alexander's arms like a kitten with a satisfied smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander excitedly circulated the Force. Only a small half of the Force left in his body by James was left. If Alexander absorbed it all, he might be able to advance to become an Advanced Warrior.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, you are so strong..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brittany blushed and touched Alexander's abdominal muscles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander chuckled. "Do you still want it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She said, "Yes, but I'm too tired to do it..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brittany buried her head in Alexander's arms in shame.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, I will help you find Felix, ask him to hand over the antidote, and help Ashley recover her health!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was very grateful. It was very rare for a man to have such a confidante.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brittany said, "Alexander, I'll take you to have dinner."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brittany prepared to get up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ouch!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She took a step but shouted with pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander chuckled and reached out to touch her buttocks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said, "Does it hurt? I'll give you a massage."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Brittany had slept with Alexander, she still felt embarrassed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander placed his hands on Brittany's thighs, used the Force to heal her, and gradually groped inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brittany hummed in comfort again...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After dozens of minutes, the two walked out of the room, snuggling together.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brittany said, "Alexander, let's go get some pizza. There's a famous pizza place nearby. It's delicious."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay, let's go."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander agreed, patted Rosalia on the shoulder and comforted her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you for protecting Ashley. I'll send you a message tonight."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosalia became excited to hear that, kissed Alexander on the cheek, and then looked at Brittany with a provocative look.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosalia didn't dare to compete with Ava but was not afraid of Brittany.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fortunately, Brittany just snorted, turned her head away arrogantly and ignored Rosalia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brittany got on the motorcycle. And Alexander sat on the back seat, hugging her waist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were speeding all the way. Alexander couldn't help but touch her body again. He gradually moved his hands upwards, holding her breasts and kneading and playing with them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brittany said, "Oh, it's itchy... Alexander, I'm riding. Please let me go..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brittany's face flushed, and her whole body was burning hot. She could only beg for mercy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander laughed happily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amidst cheerful laughter, the two arrived at a restaurant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander found a seat by the window and sat opposite Brittany.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two were eating when a young man wearing a leather jacket and dyed green hair came towards their table with a few strong men.</span></p><div class="pagination">
