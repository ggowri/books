Even a tiny bit of this diluted liquid is incredibly miraculous."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander had been severely injured and reached the verge of death, only sustained by the golden energy. But now, his strength had recovered to its peak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He clenched his fists, feeling a gush of power surge through his body, and his protective energy seemed ready to burst out. Thanks to the golden energy, his strength had increased again, bringing him one step closer to becoming a level-five warrior.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A level-five warrior could comprehend the true meaning of martial arts, return to simplicity, condense the Force into a pellet, and achieve the Diamond Body. Alexander wondered when he could become a level-five warrior.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, Alexander leaped and stepped onto a large tree, looking into the distance. His face turned ashen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He murmured, "That girl's internal energy is powerful, but it seems that Frieza's internal energy has doubled. Could it be that he transformed?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You are the heir of the Devil Cult!" Erica's face grew solemn. With a shout, she disappeared in an instant. Holy light surged behind Frieza, and Erica reappeared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Meteor Fist!" Countless dazzling silver-white light columns burst forth, bombarding Frieza's back like a fierce storm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Frieza sneered. He suddenly turned around, not dodging but forcefully crossing his strong arms in front of his face to endure the attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bang! Countless bright light explosions flashed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, a huge and dazzling purple wave shot out from the light explosion, reaching Erica's head in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Erica shouted. Holy light surged from her feet. With a leap, she soared into mid-air. She exclaimed, "Damn!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A huge, barely visible demonic shadow flashed out from the light explosion, abruptly appearing behind Erica. It lashed out its leg, with scarlet flames spraying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a bang, Erica was violently smashed into the ground, creating a deep hole.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In mid-air, Frieza looked ferocious. He roared, "Demon's Ray!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His thick right index finger frantically pointed at Erica. A dazzling array of scarlet and light column traced mysterious arcs, shooting towards Erica in the hole.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Deafening bangs sounded. Gigantic dome-shaped scarlet light explosions kept flashing, merging, and expanding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The ground kept shaking and cracking. Huge rocks and trees were sent flying into the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The forest in the distance was like being in a category-ten storm. Big trees bent and broke.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander gasped in shock. His heart was pounding. He thought, "Frieza's aura is exactly the same as the weakest aura in the Dominion Church's meditation hall!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The golden energy in Alexander's left chest pulsated wildly, and a fighting spirit boiled, urging him to exterminate all demons.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander made up his mind. Blue-silver flames spurted from his feet, and he rushed towards the battlefield like a comet to fight Frieza.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There wasn't a wisp of wind in the air, and the sun had disappeared. In the far sky, dark clouds were churning and surging, announcing that a tempest was about to come.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the bottomless pit, Erica, a knight, had blood gushing from her mouth. Her arms were covered with bloodstains. Her silver armor, which originally shone with holy light, had become a bit dim, with faint, dense spider-web-like cracks appearing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Erica spat out a large mouthful of dark blood. Her delicate eyebrows furrowed tightly. A flash of determination and solitude flashed across her blue eyes. She shouted, and holy light surged all over her body again. She stomped her foot and shot up into the air like a crossbow bolt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're still alive! A first-stage transformation is enough for me to kill you thousands of times!" Frieza crossed his thick arms in front of his chest and laughed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Erica's light-golden long hair fluttered in the wind, setting off her fair and delicate skin. Her blue eyes were deep and serene. The corners of her coral-colored lips curled slightly. She tilted her head and looked towards the west, murmuring, "Farewell, brother!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Holy flames suddenly appeared in her beautiful eyes, steaming and spurting all over her body. The flames rose 100 feet high. Her Silver Cloth emitted a great deal of holy light. A dazzling light column with a diameter of more than 30 feet suddenly shot up into the sky.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blood kept spurting out from Erica's mouth, faintly mixed with some fragments of internal organs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Erica said firmly, "I praise the Lord. The Lord's glory will be with me. Gabryl, the great sovereign of judgment. Burn my soul! I'm willing to burn my soul and dedicate it to you for all eternity. Please grant me the power of judgment to purify all evil."</span></p><div class="pagination">
