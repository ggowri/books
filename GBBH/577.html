  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I am not someone just anyone can look down on, not even the Morris family."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix stood with his hands behind his back, full of confidence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmph, you sure talk big!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though Grayson couldn't stop himself from trembling, he refused to back down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix waved dismissively. "Go and report to your master before you get in over your head."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Outrageous! Felix, you're going too far!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grayson's face turned livid.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wanted to attack, but knowing he wasn't a match only fueled his frustration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Felix, you've got some nerve, causing trouble at my Morris Villa!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, a furious shout rang out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A tall, imposing middle-aged man stormed out of the courtyard like a tiger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes were sharp and fierce, and he fixed a hard stare on Felix.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Felix, you dare run your mouth here? Kneel down and apologize!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing the newcomer, Grayson was immediately overjoyed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Weston, you're just in time! Teach this fool a lesson for daring to disrespect our family."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Weston Morris, though not one of the family's top ten experts like Diego, was firmly in the top twenty. It's far stronger than Grayson.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The gathered Morris family members breathed a sigh of relief, ready to enjoy the show now that Weston was here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Weston? What nonsense. His strength is pathetic."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix mocked disdainfully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Weston was furious. "Felix, who do you think you are, acting so arrogant?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm here to see your master. Move it! Good dogs don't block the way!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix struck out like lightning, his speed power erupting as he moved like a ghost, impossibly fast.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Smack!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Weston could react, Felix slapped him, sending him sprawling heavily to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You...you coward, how dare you attack me by surprise?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Weston's face twisted with anger as he shouted in frustration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Smack!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix struck again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Weston took another brutal slap, blood spurting from his nose and mouth as his cheek swelled like a giant dumpling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You! How dare you slap my face? You must have a death wish..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Covering his face, Weston was filled with a mixture of fear and shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>So</span><span> what if I slap you? Who do you think you are? Go get your master out here to see me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Enough!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>An angry voice boomed from deep within the courtyard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though far away, the voice was strong and resonant, like a forceful blow right in Felix's ear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix turned pale, involuntarily stepping back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He never expected the Morris family to have such a terrifying power. A mere word from him had already unsettled Felix.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Morris!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Weston, Grayson, and the other black-clad men all knelt toward the direction of the voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix was rattled. The last time he'd come to the Morris Villa, he hadn't met the master.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hadn't realized the master of the Morris family was such a fearsome power!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix assessed the situation carefully, realizing he had no confidence in a win.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix, who only bullied the weak, immediately drew in his energy and stopped standing so tall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let him in!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The authoritative voice held no trace of emotion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix couldn't stop himself from shivering.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just a moment ago, he sensed a terrifying gaze from deep within the Morris Villa, piercing through him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix felt an icy chill spread over him; this was just from a single look.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Martial arts truly held a terrifying power!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix estimated that the master's power was at least several times Diego's level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Weston and Grayson glared furiously at Felix. Disturbing the master was a sign of their own incompetence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Regaining his composure, Felix let out a cold snort and, with a serious expression, walked into the courtyard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Weston and Grayson quickly followed him, leading the way forward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix suddenly noticed patches of blood on the ground, and the air still held a faint metallic smell. Clearly, a fierce battle had taken place here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What happened here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He immediately grew cautious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Weston gave him a disdainful look.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Felix, don't think a bit of power lets you run wild in the Morris Villa! If not for the real threat we just faced, you wouldn't have left here in one piece!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
