  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A heated, tingling sensation spread from Betty's chest to her entire body, making her tremble with excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her eyes widened as she watched her curves being pressed and molded. The thrill was beyond words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Boss, how many women have you bewitched with this little trick?" Betty asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Betty panted as she pressed on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander chuckled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Betty, you're teasing me. I'd never harm a woman on purpose. It's all mutual, you know.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You asked for it yourself just now, or did you forget already?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Betty was lost for words at his remark.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, I did offer it myself because it felt so good. My ex couldn't do it like this," she gasped, voice laced with temptation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Betty breathed heavily, irresistibly alluring.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander couldn't resist asking, watching her flirtatious expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, how was it with your ex? Exciting? Come on, tell me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He increased the speed of Force, making Betty tremble with pleasure, her mind growing hazy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My first boyfriend was my college classmate. Once, a group of us went hiking, and he and I got separated from the others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"On our way back down, he pushed me onto the grass... We stayed together until graduation. Even after I started working at the Brilliant Group, he tried to come back into my life."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Betty's cheeks flushed as she glanced at Alexander's bold look.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He was half your size, and he never got me to the finish line. Each time, he'd be satisfied, and I'd be left with this uncomfortable feeling."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander chuckled again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, I see. No wonder you ended it. An unsatisfied woman can be dangerous."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Betty continued recalling her past.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My second one was a fitness coach, six feet tall with muscles everywhere.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I got drunk at a party once. When I woke up, we were in a hotel room, and he was already going at it. He was a bit bigger than my first.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It was the first time I enjoyed being a woman... but he moved out of town for business, and we eventually lost contact."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Didn't you ask him why?" Alexander asked curiously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Betty gave a bitter smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Maybe he got tired of me or found someone else. They say even the most beautiful woman has a man who's done with her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander mused; women really were strange creatures.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Surely many men had pursued Betty, but she chose to waste her youth on unreliable ones and seemed to enjoy it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the end, who knew if Betty's words were true or not, but it was clear she was still trying to seduce Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander felt a definite thrill and an odd sense of excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Betty took Alexander's hand, guiding it downwards.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's desire flared up like wildfire, burning intensely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Betty suddenly touched herself and then brought her hand to Alexander's lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I used shower gel before coming over. Does it smell nice?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What are you doing?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A fresh scent filled Alexander's nose, and his lips were wet with it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Betty playfully pressed herself against Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They say I'm not only fragrant but sweet too. Here's a free sample for you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander shot her a look.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I only sample what no one else has, or it turns me off."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, Boss, you're turning me down? So many men wish they could have a taste, and I won't let them... And as if you haven't been with plenty already! Charlize, and even Rosalia... don't think I don't know."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a mischievous smile, Betty slipped her hand into Alexander's pants.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Heh, men talk one way but act another."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You've gone too far. I'll have to punish you for that!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander pinched her gently, sending waves of tingling pleasure through Betty, leaving her gasping and weakly leaning against him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come on..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Betty's voice was dripping with seductive allure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander slid down her white lace thong, revealing her soft curves and a glistening hint of desire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Betty, with a pout, said, "Boss, don't be mad. I was just messing with you. I only ever had one first love, and we only did it a few times."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander couldn't help but laugh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, was he any good? How long could he last?"</span></p><div class="pagination">
