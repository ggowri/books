  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Following Clay's shout, the dragon head stick began to absorb the black energy from Elaina's chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As it surged, her eyelids fluttered a few times, as if they were about to open.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Orlando shook with excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She's saved. Elaina's saved."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone's eyes widened in astonishment and admiration for Clay.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander remained composed and waited for the result.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elaina let out a long breath. Though unconscious, she obviously had normal reactions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, her pale face became much rosier. Orlando finally breathed a sigh of relief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clay smiled triumphantly and withdrew the dragon head stick.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I have almost cured Ms. Elaina Gomez. Let her get more sleep to recover her strength. She will be back to normal soon."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Overjoyed, Orlando wiped his tears vigorously. "Thank you, Mr. Burch. Thank you, Mr. Burch!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clay glanced at Alexander icily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I have cured Ms. Elaina Gomez. Apologize to me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander didn't obey at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Orlando immediately ordered, "Come here, make him apologize to Mr. Burch."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The bodyguards swarmed forward and were about to attack Alexander menacingly. Suddenly, a terrifying aura appeared, trapping them all and making them unable to move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander asked calmly, "Clay, did you really cure Ms. Elaina Gomez?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The facts are right in front of you. Why don't you admit it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clay was full of confidence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, a doctor exclaimed, "Oh no!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The ECG monitor began to beep, and Elaina's blood pressure plummeted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's terrible. Ms. Elaina Gomez's heart rate and blood pressure are dropping rapidly!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Look, Ms. Elaina Gomez is covered in that black energy..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone was stunned, gazing at Elaina.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elaina stiffened, the dark energy covering her face, and she began to convulse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The most terrifying thing was her face. It had been rosy just now, but now, it was getting darker and darker. In just a few seconds, it was as black as charcoal. It was very scary.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elaina!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Orlando suddenly came back to his senses and rushed over to hug Elaina tightly like a madman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why is it so cold? Oh no! Why is her body so cold?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elaina's body was as cold as a dead person's.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Impossible! Wasn't she healed just now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clay panicked and quickly checked the dragon head stick.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Someone is playing tricks! Someone must be playing tricks!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes were wide open as Clay glared at everyone present, but he still didn't take Alexander seriously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, the ECG monitor emitted a long, shrill sound, and the ECG graph unexpectedly changed from a faint curve to a straight line.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Elaina Gomez is dead!?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sudden and drastic change shocked everyone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elaina, you can't die! You can't die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Orlando cried in despair and hugged Elaina tightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He lost his only child and felt like the end of the world was coming.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let me check on her again. It's absolutely impossible..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clay hurried over and examined Elaina carefully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He sensed the black energy emanating from her body. It was clearly the witchcraft he had cast. Why couldn't he get it back with the dragon head stick?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clay muttered to himself in horror, "How could this happen? It's absolutely impossible. Impossible..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Orlando grabbed him tightly and asked angrily, "Clay, what happened? Why did my daughter die?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Gomez, this is impossible. Ms. Elaina Gomez will definitely not die. I clearly cured her just now," Clay stuttered, at a loss.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How ridiculous!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, a contemptuous voice rang out. Although it was not loud, everyone </span><span>heard it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They pivoted around and saw that it was Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He mocked mercilessly, "Clay, you caused Ms. Elaina Gomez's death, but you still claimed it was impossible. You are just a loser!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clay was furious. "Shut up! You have no right to speak here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander sneered, "You killed Ms. Elaina Gomez, and you stopped me from mentioning it. However, facts speak louder than words. You ended Ms. Elaina Gomez's life with your actions."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What a damn future star! What a disgrace!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's sharp words irritated Clay so much that he screamed.</span></p><div class="pagination">
