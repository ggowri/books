  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Rolling the logs!" A loud shout came from the camp wall. Huge logs and massive boulders suddenly rolled out from the wall. Wherever the Risunese passed, they were cleared away, leaving only a ground of broken limbs, blood, and mashed flesh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fuck! Kill them!" A fierce-looking Risunese armored general, brandishing his long spear, roared angrily and led the charge. He stomped his foot, and his body soared into the air, landing towards the camp wall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get lost!" Alexander roared. A dazzling blue light enveloped a flying axe, which spun and instantly slashed toward the head of the Risunese general.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In mid-air, the Risunese general only had time to cross his spear to block the axe. With a crisp clang, the spear broke, and the flying axe stabbed his head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Risunese general's head was split in half, and something red and white burst out. He didn't even grunt and met his end.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing more and more Risunese under the camp wall, Enoch roared, "Pouring the liquid!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing this, some soldiers poured the boiling oil and feces water down on the Risunese below the wall. Clouds of smoke mixed with a strange stench rose into the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The dense mass of Risunese below the wall was like ants in a frying pan. Some didn't even grunt and fell to the ground. On others, blisters instantly appeared on their bodies, and they scurried around.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hogan raised his spear, jumped down from the camp wall, and shouted, "Spreading Fire!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His whole body burst out with scarlet flames. The flames on the spear rolled within several feet. The Risunese who touched it flew away and died. The hot oil on the ground burned fiercely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the high cliff of Hero Gorge, Frieza stood with his hands behind his back. He stared at the Hrodvik camp from afar. He thought, "It seems that there is no powerful internal energy, just some nobodies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The expert in the Divine Transformation State is probably not there. Good. I can wipe out this rear-guard army and then kill Fermin."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll leave it to you, Galo," Frieza said coldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Galo, a short and chubby dwarf, yelled excitedly. A bright white air wave spurted from his feet, and his figure shot towards the Hrodvik camp.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander blasted a Risunese into two halves with a palm strike, then suddenly looked up, his expression changing. "What a powerful internal energy!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the distance, a short figure stood in mid-air. It was Galo. He had thick and short limbs, a pot belly, a thin upper body, and a thick lower body. He had a bald and scabby head and a pair of bulging eyes. His face was covered with pockmarks, and strangely, his ears had bumps. He wore a white-striped armor with raised brown shoulder pads on both sides.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander raised an eyebrow and clenched his fists. He mobilized his internal energy and Sky-Dancing Technique. His movement seemed slow but was actually fast as he flew towards Galo.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Galo suddenly opened his eyes wide and raised his thick and short arms in a grasping shape in front of his chest. He drew a semi-circle with his hands, knelt on his right knee, and struck a strange pose like a crane spreading its wings, shouting, "I'm Galo Neville, a warrior from Hell Force!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander frowned, "Here comes a lunatic!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Galo was annoyed when he saw Alexander's disdainful look. He shouted, "How dare you look down on me? I'm a warrior from Hell Force."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hell Force? Alexander stared coldly at Galo, saying nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Galo rolled his eyes, sneered, and said in a hoarse voice, "Brat, I advise you to surrender to Frieza, or you'll die here today!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was shocked when he heard the name Frieza.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander thought, "Frieza? That strange dwarf? No way. He does look a bit like Frieza, but he doesn't have a tail. It must be a coincidence. In Dragon Ball, Frieza can blow up a planet with one finger."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Galo suddenly widened his big, bulging eyes and shouted, "Go to hell!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the next second, a bright white flame burst out from Galo's body. His short figure was like a streak of lightning, and one of his thick and short arms smashed toward Alexander's head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Galo's attack was so fast. Alexander was shocked. He only had time to cross his arms and barely blocked Galo's attack. With a loud bang, Alexander was smashed into the camp wall like a meteor falling to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alex!" Enoch and Hogan soared into the air. Two golden spears, one on the left and one on the right, one shining with golden light, the other bursting with flames, bombarded Galo like violent storms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Galo sneered contemptuously, stretched out his hands, and dazzling light balls condensed in his palms. They instantly burst, and two dazzling light columns shot out, hitting Enoch and Hogan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next second, Enoch and Hogan were sent flying backward, crashing straight into the Hrodvik camp with bangs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You are too feeble. Fortunately, the captain and the others aren't here. It's so fun!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Galo laughed, narrowing his bulging eyes.</span></p><div class="pagination">
