  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander greedily caressed and kneaded them, his excitement growing with each of Nancy's soft moans.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The pleasure became unbearable, concentrating at the base of his spine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I..." Alexander intended to tell Nancy to stop, but she only tightened her grip, using her tongue to press and gently sweep from side to side.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Overwhelmed by the intense stimulation, Alexander released his control.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The force was so powerful that a trickle of liquid escaped from the corner of Nancy's mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She looked up at him with a mix of shyness and reproach.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander grew even more excited and gestured to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cleverly, Nancy rolled her eyes but complied, swallowing everything with a gulp.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She then continued to kiss him meticulously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That feels amazing." Alexander sprawled out, thoroughly satisfied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Having the stunning leader of the Kaylon humble herself to serve him brought an unparalleled sense of psychological satisfaction that no other woman could match.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After washing up in the bathroom, she snuggled back into Alexander's arms, using his arm as a pillow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, Nancy's phone on the table rang.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander casually picked it up and answered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Nancy, I miss you so much. What are you doing?" the voice on the other end asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy scoffed, "What am I doing? I'm in bed with my husband."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Nancy, what are you talking about? Are you trying to make me angry? Even though I'm from the City of Sorcery, I know both magic and martial arts. My future is bright. Feelings can be cultivated. I really like you," Clay rambled on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But women, especially beautiful ones, hated nagging men.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Clay, listen carefully. I'm in bed with my husband. Don't you understand human language? Get lost!" Nancy snapped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander chuckled, "Clay, get out of </span><span>Kingsdon</span><span> immediately. Don't let me see you again, or you'll regret it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Clay, did you hear that? My husband said you should leave </span><span>Kingsdon</span><span> right away," Nancy said smugly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was a moment of silence on the other end, indicating Clay's anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy deliberately cooed into the phone, "Honey, I love you so much. I'll do anything you say."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clay exploded, "Nancy, are you really with that bastard Alexander? Is it him?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who I'm with is none of your business. Get lost!" Nancy shouted before hanging up and blocking Clay's number.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander laughed heartily and pulled Nancy into a kiss.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Breathlessly, Nancy said, "Come on, I'll take you to the Kaylon entertainment center. Barry and Felix have been there for two days already."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, a loud rumbling sound came from outside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander looked out the window to see a helicopter landing on the lawn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the VIP room of the Kaylon entertainment center, Barry had just lost another 500 million dollars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His face was pale, and his body trembled slightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Still, he refused to admit defeat. Goaded by Jaylon and Finley, he would not leave the </span><span>table.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix stood silently by the side. He had already made it clear that he wouldn't provide any more money after this loss.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barry was completely absorbed in the game, unable to extricate himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix sneered at Barry with contempt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since he wasn't going to provide any more money, it didn't matter to him even if Barry lost everything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Morris family was immensely wealthy, and Barry was one of the direct heirs, but the family had many descendants.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Therefore, Barry's expenses were limited to a certain amount.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was because he held significant power and was one of the current leaders of the Morris family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Otherwise, after losing one billion last time, he would have faced severe punishment, ranging from being grounded to being stripped of his status as a direct </span><span>heir</span><span> and expelled from the family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The reason Barry was after Felix's money was that he was desperately short of funds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Morris family had reduced his monthly allowance to no more than ten million.</span></p><div class="pagination">
