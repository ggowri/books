  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"We're leaving."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander gave Maxine, who was still in a daze, a gentle pat on the back before leading her and her father out with confident strides.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As they stepped through the club's front door, Alexander suddenly paused, glanced over his shoulder, and gave Thomas a mysterious smile. With a snap of his fingers, he added, "Snap!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Snap!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thomas jumped, startled by the sound. When he saw that Alexander and his companions were truly leaving, he finally let out a sigh of relief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But then, an intense, searing pain exploded in his body. It felt as if a thousand sharp blades were twisting inside him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before leaving, Alexander activated the Force hidden within Thomas' body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before Thomas could react, he collapsed to the floor, writhing in agony, blood gushing from his mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon, it wasn't just from his mouth&mdash;blood began pouring from his eyes, nose, and ears, staining his face in a horrific, ghastly display.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Within mere minutes, before the ambulance could even arrive, Thomas convulsed violently and fell still, his body lifeless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Meanwhile, Alexander was back in the car with Alvin and Maxine. As they pulled away from the club, Emma broke down in tears from the overwhelming relief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Maxine, seeing her mother safe, let out a long sigh of relief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alvin, however, wore a grim expression. His fear was palpable&mdash;he was sure that the Nicholson family had drugged him, controlling him with no way out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Emma, still trembling, asked, "What happened to Thomas?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Don't worry," Alexander replied coolly. "I've taken control of ninety percent of Silver Shield Security. It's mine now&mdash;no longer in the hands of the Nicholson family."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He pulled out two signed, unpaid transfer agreements and handed them to Alvin and Maxine to examine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The two stared at the documents, wide-eyed in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They reread it several times, still stunned. The signatures of Thomas and his son were unmistakable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The agreements confirmed that ninety percent of the company's shares had been transferred to Alexander, free of charge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Maxine gasped, "Why would they do this? Why would they give up the shares so easily?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander smiled faintly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"They didn't do it for any reason other than fear. They signed over their shares to save their lives. Unfortunately for Thomas, he chose to die. That's not on me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His tone was flat, emotionless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alvin's face tightened, a flicker of panic flashing in his eyes. He had always been a straightforward, by-the-book kind of man, but the harshness in Alexander's words unsettled him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Noticing Alvin's discomfort, Alexander gave him a reassuring smile and said, "I'm planning to appoint you as the General Manager of Silver Shield Security, to oversee the day-to-day operations. How does that sound?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Me? General Manager?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alvin's eyes widened in shock, but the next second, his excitement deflated, his shoulders sagging.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne, I...I'm still under the Nicholson family's drug control. I don't think I can handle such a responsibility."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Emma quickly interjected, "Why are you worried? Alexander already found the antidote. If you hadn't been captured, he would've cured you by now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander nodded, his voice calm. "That's right. The antidote's ready. As soon as we get back to the hotel, I'll help you fully break free from their control."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Really? That's wonderful!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alvin's face lit up with relief, the weight of his worries lifting for the first time in what felt like forever.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne, I can't let you help us for free. I'm willing to transfer the All-purpose Bullet-resistant Jacket technology to you at no cost. Thank you for saving our family."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He squeezed his wife's hand, his expression full of gratitude.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander couldn't help but feel a slight blush creeping onto his face, glancing at Emma, whose expression was unreadable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He couldn't help but wonder&mdash;if Alvin knew about his and Emma's time together in the mountains, would he be as thankful? Would he even kill him for it?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As they arrived at the hotel, Alexander turned to the pair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You two talk it out. I'll go prepare the antidote."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Alexander, you've been working non-stop. Don't you need to rest for a bit?" Maxine asked, concerned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'm fine," he replied with a casual smile. "I'll be back soon."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With that, he headed for the kitchen, carrying the items he'd collected.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As Maxine watched him go, she couldn't help but notice how her daughter's eyes shone with admiration for him. A strange mix of emotions swirled in Emma's chest, like a bottle of mixed spices&mdash;it was hard to pinpoint exactly what she was feeling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before long, Alexander had turned the herbs into a paste, and the room filled with a calming, refreshing scent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Wow, it smells amazing!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Maxine couldn't resist walking into the kitchen to see what was going on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She had already showered and changed into a silky camisole nightgown, her Radiant skin glowing, her curves accentuated by the soft fabric.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The hem of the gown fluttered just above her knees, revealing her legs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander caught a glimpse of her, but quickly turned his attention back to the task at hand. He focused on packing the medicine into a small cup, mixing it with hot water.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Maxine's face flushed pink as she bit her lower lip and asked shyly, "Alexander... do you think I'm pretty?"</span></p><div class="pagination">
