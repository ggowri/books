  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Xavier felt a chill run down his spine as he recognized the figures closing in on them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They weren't the run-of-the-mill security guards he could brush off; these were seasoned professionals, hardened by experience.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With powerful figures backing the Grand Hyatt Estates&mdash;rumored to be a high-ranking military official&mdash;the patrol team had a reputation for being ruthless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The patrol team had a zero-tolerance policy for trespassers, regardless of their status.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Xavier was only an owner of a modest unit in the estates, thanks to his mother, Julia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, he found himself in deep trouble, having trespassed into the elite territory of the Grand Hyatt Estates' Majestic Manor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Uh, excuse us! We didn't mean to intrude. We just thought the scenery looked amazing, and then we </span><span>kinda</span><span> got lost..." he quickly said, waving his hands in a pleading gesture.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Jennifer wasn't having any of it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Ulysses, why are you afraid of these guards? You're an owner here! Just tell them to step aside; we're just here to say hi to the neighbors!" she exclaimed defiantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If looks could kill, Xavier would've shot her one right then and there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He yanked her away, hissing, "Shut up! We're just lost, okay?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Xavier couldn't even bear to think about what could happen if the patrol team decided to take them in&mdash;bruised bodies at best, broken bones at worst.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was haunted by thoughts of that thief who had ended up hanging around for days, and a cold shiver crept along his spine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jennifer, oblivious to the severity of the situation, frowned at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But Mr. Ulysses, they're just a few guards with guns. Why be so scared?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Xavier snapped in frustration, "For crying out loud, shut your mouth! If you keep talking nonsense, I swear I'll kill you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He mused, "This woman is downright stupid!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The patrolmen remained </span><span>silent,</span><span> their gaze fixed on the two with a chilling sneer. After he finished, the lead patrol officer stepped forward, handcuffs glinting menacingly in his grasp.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Finished making excuses? Because after this, I'm taking you both back. Trespassing on private property? Bold move!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He advanced with an air of authority, and the palpable intimidation made beads of sweat form on Xavier's forehead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sorry! Seriously, gentlemen, we really didn't mean to trespass. I'm an owner too&mdash;how about I give you some cash to let us go?" Xavier pleaded, desperation saturating his voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing the chaos unfold, Jennifer finally realized the gravity of the situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Xavier dropped all pretense of dignity, desperately offering apologies and trying to bribe the guards.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The lead officer smirked, exposing a set of teeth that gleamed with cold amusement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, we know you're an owner. We've had eyes on you since you set foot at the mountain's base. And all your little conversations? Recorded. You won't be getting off easy this time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You knowingly committed the deed! You won't be getting off easy this time."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A shudder coursed through Xavier's body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The realization hit him like a ton of bricks. This was no ordinary mess he had stumbled into, and there would be no way for his mom to spare him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jennifer chimed in, "Well, it's just a little unauthorized entry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What can they really do to us? Besides, Mr. Ulysses, you're an owner here; </span><span>surely</span><span> they can't stop us from meeting the neighbors!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a fit of frustration, Xavier slapped Jennifer across the face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You clueless idiot! Would you just be quiet?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jennifer clutched her stinging cheek, tears pouring down her face as she began to sob uncontrollably.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, two patrolmen came up, firmly holding Xavier's arms and slipping the cuffs on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Cut the act. There's no way we're letting you off the hook," one of them said, grinning coldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Xavier's heart raced, fear coursing through him as the icy expressions on the guards' faces mirrored his worst nightmares.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll pay you each 100 thousand dollars&mdash;no, 200 thousand! If that's not enough, just call my mom! She'll back me up!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Xavier was scrambling for a way out as he stammered through one last desperate appeal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shut your mouth! Are you insulting me, Evander Blanchett?" the leader, Evander, barked angrily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing Evander's name sent a chill down Xavier's spine, causing his legs to tremble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Y... you're the one who hung the thief up for days, right?" he stuttered, his voice barely above a whisper.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evander let out a chilling laugh. "Oh, that's nothing. Once, I skinned a terrorist alive and pulled out his tendons.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just wait until we get you into the interrogation room. You'll find out exactly what happens when someone crosses into private territory.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's been a while since I've had a fool like you to play with, and I'm itching for some action. Just imagine if I took a slice of your skin. You'd definitely learn your lesson </span><span>and think twice about barging in next time."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Xavier almost lost control of his bladder at Evander's words.</span></p><div class="pagination">
