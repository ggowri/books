  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander remained calm and composed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're hitmen here for that one-hundred-million-dollar bounty on the Dark Web?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop wasting time! Are you coming with us quietly, or do we need to make you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man in the suit sneered, cracking his knuckles with a loud snap.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A glint of danger flashed in Alexander's eyes as he pulled Betty behind him for protection.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Antony, leaning heavily on a cane, hobbled in front of Alexander and ordered coldly. "Don't resist. Come with us!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His voice was as frigid as an Arctic wind, making Betty shiver uncontrollably.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't be afraid. Wait for me in the car for a few minutes; it won't take long."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander reassured her, giving her a gentle pat on the back. A surge of Force filled her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Betty felt the warmth wash over her body and immediately stopped shivering.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll wait for you!" she replied, and with a determined wiggle, she dashed into the car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kid, what did you just say? You'll deal with us in a few minutes? That's so arrogant; I'll make you cry!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The old man, Antony, felt deeply insulted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander waved dismissively. "Enough with the chatter; I've dealt with hitmen before. Let's get this over with!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The suited man grinned wickedly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We're in the top one hundred hitmen on the Dark Web. If you come quietly, we might leave you intact.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As for the girl, she's quite attractive; I'll take her for myself."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was amused by their audacity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You two are pathetic. I wonder why you are so bold, but since you won't make a move, I'll take action."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a commanding shout, he unleashed a wave of Force that roared like a lion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A brilliant white beam burst from his mouth, streaking like an arrow toward the old man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Force Breath!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Back when Alexander was just starting out as a Warrior, this move could blast through concrete.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, as a seasoned fighter, his Force Breath had become something else entirely - a searing blast that felt more like a dragon's fury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What is this?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The old man was stunned and terrified. After Alexander's roar, he was already shaken, and now the intense heat was upon him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He barely had time to swing his cane at the wave of energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Crack!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The cane, forged from steel, shattered on impact.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The elderly man's hands were splintered and bleeding as the Force Breath slammed into his chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was thrown backward, crashing to the ground, and after spitting out several mouthfuls of blood, he lay still.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The suited man was dumbfounded, never expecting that Alexander could take out his partner with just a breath of white mist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wanted to flee but dared not turn his back to Alexander, knowing it would be his death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With wide eyes, the man produced two short daggers about a foot long and charged at Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sharp blades whistled through the air, fierce and lethal!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Child's play."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To the man's shock, Alexander reached out and grabbed the blades.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man rejoiced, thinking he had the upper hand, not realizing he'd made a grave mistake.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clang!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, the gleaming daggers snapped like crisp chips, falling to the ground in countless pieces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Alexander's hand remained unscathed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despair washed over the man. This was no ordinary person!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, he cursed the bounty poster. If he had known how terrifying Alexander was, he wouldn't have come for a hundred million, not even for one billion dollars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had completely lost his will to fight and turned to run.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Running? Did you get my permission?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a flash, Alexander vanished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moving so fast that only a shadow remained, he appeared behind the man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He struck the man's back with a powerful blow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Boom!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The torrent of Force surged through, exploding outward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man screamed as his clothes shredded, blood spraying everywhere as he collapsed to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Two formidable killers, lured by the bounty from the Red Umbrella Group, were </span><span>effortlessly sent to their doom by Alexander.</span></p><div class="pagination">
