  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander nodded. "Thank you for bringing a gleam of hope, although it is like looking for a needle in a haystack."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Spreading his hands, he shrugged as he was also helpless to handle that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he failed to find the top-grade gems he wanted, the only thing he could do was to boost his Force as fast as he could. Thinking of that, Alexander couldn't help looking at Alice and Alyssa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was already noon, so Alyssa ordered the servants to prepare lunch and cater to Alexander, Alice, and Xavier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, in the intensive care unit of the best hospital in Goldford, Ian lay on the hospital bed with a distorted face in pain while several doctors and nurses were busy taking care of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought that maybe the major hospital in Goldford could save his legs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, after the expert consultation, the doctors all diagnosed that his legs had to be amputated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it. I'll definitely kill that fucker!" With rage, Ian glared at the imagination of his arch-enemy in his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A doctor was still describing his condition, asking him to get familiar with sitting in a wheelchair first and then change to prosthetic limbs later.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In his mind, Ian felt an enormous humiliation from the doctor's suggestions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shut up, loser! Get the fuck out of my ward! I don't want to hear your nonsense. You can't even treat my legs!" Ian roared angrily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He grabbed something at hand, like cups and fruits, and threw them at the doctor like a lunatic man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, alright! Calm down! We're leaving!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those doctors and nurses were shocked and ran away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They heard that this patient was a member of the Mafia. They couldn't afford to offend him for fear of getting into trouble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Son of bitch... a bunch of losers!" Ian cursed angrily, panting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at the legs tightly wrapped in gauze, he just wanted to kill Alexander right now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anger and hatred burned in his heart, and his hatred for Alexander reached its peak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll find that bastard and kill him! As for that bitch, I'll make her kneel and beg me to fuck her! I'll destroy them all!" Ian had lost his mind, and his expression was like that of a devil.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the middle of his venting rage, a middle-aged man walked into his ward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without even looking at his face, Ian just madly cursed that man, "Piss off! Who let you in? Get out now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That man said unhappily, "I'm here to visit you under Mr. Oldman's order."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My brother told you to come here? Did he kill that bastard or snatch Alice?" Ian asked a series of questions full of expectations.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He frowned and answered impatiently, "That guy got away, but Mr. Oldman promised to avenge you! According to intelligence, they have already entered the Axe's headquarters."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They seemed to resort to Alyssa, which indicated that they came for the Mafia, not you," he added.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What? They're hanging out with that bitch now?" Ian's brows suddenly frowned, and his expression was mixed with complicated feelings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He angrily questioned, "Since they are enemies, why not kill them all?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing that, that man glanced at him as if looking at an idiot and said nonchalantly, "We had battles with the Axe and know well about their power. We can only be at war with them after Mr. Oldman gets Godfather's permission."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anger drove Ian to clench his fists, and he cursed fiercely, "That motherfucker! Damn it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Helplessly, he knew that without Godfather's permission, even though Paxton was the charger of the Mafia's branch in the Mandale Town, he had no right to start war with the Axe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it! I should have thought long ago that they must have someone backing them up, but it's really beyond my expectations that they sought help from Alyssa! Otherwise, how dare they cripple my legs..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the anger began to subside, a deep sense of helplessness struck him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing him like this, that man sneered and looked down upon such a loser who could neither fight nor scheme.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it weren't because of Paxton, Ian couldn't gain a higher salary and position than him.</span></p><div class="pagination">
