  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hehe, little beauty, are you ready to have some fun with us? Don't worry. We will make you enjoy every minute if you be with us!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The group of men immediately closed in around Rosalia, their eyes full of lust, leering at her ample chest and curvy hips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although they were leering, they didn't let their guard down. They were still gripping their weapons tightly, and it was clear that they were seasoned killers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Some of them had guns, and others had knives or machetes. These were not men to be taken lightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Rosalia remained completely at ease, her arms crossed over her chest, making her ample bosom even more tempting as it bounced slightly with each step.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come on, sweetheart, hand over Hazel and the kid, then come with us. We'll let these old fools go and pretend nothing happened. How does that sound?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As that bald man spoke, Rosalia didn't stop. She swayed her hips, coming right up to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Did you just say you'd help me enjoy my time?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosalia's smile was deadly, her eyes filled with murderous intent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The bald man froze, a cold chill running down his spine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't move! Don't you dare move, or I'll shoot!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The bald man's reaction was swift. He felt an overwhelming sense of danger as Rosalia walked to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosalia giggled, purposely squeezing her chest with her arm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What? Are you afraid of women?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The other men didn't understand why that bald man had backed away, and they all started laughing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I didn't know you were scared of women!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Pfft, with a hot </span><span>chick</span><span> like this, why would you be scared? Just take her</span><span> down</span><span>!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That bald man ignored them, and his face was drenched in sweat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He raised his gun, pointing it at Rosalia, his voice rough with fury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't move! Stay where you are, or I'll shoot!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I said</span><span>, </span><span>don't move</span><span>! </span><span>Don't you understand?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before he could finish, he let out a blood-curdling scream, his body jerking violently. Everyone froze in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosalia grabbed his gun hand and slammed him into the ground with a huge power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a thud, that bald man's head smashed into the rock floor with a sickening crack, instantly caving in. He didn't make a sound as his body collapsed to the ground, twitching in his death throes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The others were still stunned, unable to react, while Rosalia continued her assault.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were still eleven men left, and none of them had expected Rosalia to strike first and with such speed and precision. She was relentless, and there was no mercy in her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A tattooed man swung his knife at her, but before he could raise it, Rosalia grabbed him by the neck, slammed him into the ground, and then tossed him aside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man flew through the air like a bullet, crashing into two others of them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The three of them tumbled into a nearby ditch, unconscious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosalia's movements were fast. She delivered powerful punches to the throats of two men.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sharp sound of broken bones filled the air as the two men fell to the ground, gasping and convulsing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the blink of an eye, half of the men were already dead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The remaining half finally snapped out of their shock, and two of them raised their guns to shoot at Rosalia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But before they could pull the trigger, Rosalia grabbed a machete and slashed it across their legs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two men howled in pain, clutching their legs as they fell to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, someone started shooting at Rosalia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She flipped gracefully, her machete cutting through the men's throats in a single motion. Blood sprayed out like fountains, spraying into the air before falling to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One of the remaining men, screaming like a mad bear, charged at her from behind, trying to grab her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Rosalia noticed his move. Without even turning around, she spun and delivered a flying kick.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the man charged at full speed, her foot hit him squarely in the stomach, sending him flying into a flower bed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A man firing the gun had emptied his clip, but not a single bullet grazed Rosalia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He scrambled backward, shaking as he tried to reload his gun.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the more frantic he became, the more disoriented he got. He couldn't reload properly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before he could finish, Rosalia appeared behind him, her beautiful face cold and ruthless. She grabbed his neck and twisted it with one swift motion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a snap, the man didn't even have time to scream before collapsing lifelessly to the ground.</span></p><div class="pagination">
