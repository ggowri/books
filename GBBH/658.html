  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joseph and that man had always been rivals, and in the past, they could barely live together in peace because of Jagger's suppression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now that Jagger was dead, the two of them immediately began competing for the position of president.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joseph's bald head was greasy, and he glared at the other party fiercely and said, "Otto, I suspect you were the one who sent people to kill Mr. Taylor!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Otto immediately roared, "Joseph! You are talking nonsense! You are slandering me! You bastard, how dare you slander me in public? I will kill you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two men glared at each other, refusing to give in to each other.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joseph and Otto were the strongest competitors for the presidency. Now that the conflict had been triggered, they must fight to the death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joseph grinned grimly. He wanted to blame Otto for Jagger's death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As long as some people believed in it, he would have the opportunity to kill Otto or at least isolate him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By then, if he united some other people, he would be able to successfully take the position and become the new president of the Glory Association.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Otto, I'm not slandering you! Everyone knows that your corruption was discovered by Mr. Taylor last month, and he cut off one of your fingers and fined you 30 million dollars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, you must have harbored a grudge and looked for an opportunity to kill him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joseph was very scheming. He found Otto's weakness and pressed him step by step.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it, you're talking nonsense. Even Mr. Taylor has forgiven me for that matter, but you deliberately brought it up to attack me. I'm going to kill you right now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Otto knew that Joseph had caught his weakness and he couldn't defend himself, so he decided to fight to the death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joseph laughed triumphantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Otto! How dare you threaten me in front of everyone? This only proves that you are guilty. Let everyone see your true side. You must have killed Mr. Taylor and exposed by me, so you are angry and embarrassed."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joseph's eloquence was indeed very good, and his arguments were well-reasoned. Otto was completely unable to refute.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Otto, everyone saw it. You did this to take the position of president, so you took the risk and killed Mr. Taylor!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If the crime wasn't committed by an acquaintance, and if it wasn't committed by someone of your status, how could Mr. Taylor be killed silently? Otto, you are such a beast!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joseph made Otto jump up in anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Joseph, you are such a despicable villain, you just want to kill me! You deliberately slandered me just to become the president.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm going to fight you to death today!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Otto pulled out his gun and pointed it at Joseph.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joseph also reacted quickly, pulled out his gun, and pointed it at Otto.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their men also confronted each other with guns in hand. The black muzzles of their guns revealed murderous intent. The atmosphere at the scene was extremely tense and solemn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As long as one person fired a gun, the scene would be a disaster.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander had been hiding on the rooftop upstairs to watch the show.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing that both sides were ready for a fight, but the show had not yet begun, Alexander chuckled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't you want to be the president? Let me help you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He aimed at Otto and fired.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bang!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sharp sound of gunfire broke the dead silence at the scene.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The bullet penetrated Otto's chest, and blood gushed out like a fountain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Otto's eyes widened in horror. He didn't expect that Joseph's men would dare to shoot first.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He glared at Joseph angrily, covered his chest, and roared, "Kill them!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Otto's gun fired, and the bullet shot towards James.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill them!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joseph fired without hesitation, and both sides began to fight desperately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bang!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fierce gunfire rang out. The two sides were only four or five meters apart. At this distance, even if one shut with his eyes closed, the lethality would be extremely great.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dozens of men on both sides aimed dozens of guns at each other and shot wildly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bullets flew, and blood splattered!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joseph and Otto, who were standing at the front, were shot numerous times and died on the spot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The men of both sides fell one after another like wheat being cut by a farmer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, the fighting between the two sides caused a large number of accidental injuries, resulting in most people starting a melee.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The gunshots became more and more intense, and people kept falling in pools of blood, screaming.</span></p><div class="pagination">
