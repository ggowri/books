  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Marshal Byron, these creatures are spreading at an alarming rate!" Quentin reported urgently. "Even though we're mobilizing our forces, the affected areas are growing exponentially."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He gestured to his aide, who pulled up the latest satellite imagery on the large LCD screen. "I've marked the infected zones in red on these satellite images," Quentin explained. "The darker the red, the worse the situation in that area."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Quentin provided commentary, everyone in the meeting room fixed their eyes on the display.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The high-resolution satellite map painted a grim picture. Apart from roughly a hundred green dots marking protected urban centers, military bases, and some remote cities, the rest of the country&mdash;millions of square miles&mdash;was stained blood red.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The deepest crimson areas, some nearly black, indicated where zombies and mutant beasts were running completely wild.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at the red zones, everyone in the room could picture the horrifying scenes playing out across the nation&mdash;countless grotesque zombies and mutated creatures terrorizing the population. Billions of ordinary citizens had already fallen victim to this catastrophe, becoming mere sacrifices for Yinson and his associates' twisted pursuit of immortality.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even more terrifying was the global spread. The red zones were multiplying rapidly across Earthia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only the frozen wastelands of the North Pole and the South Pole, too inhospitable for most life forms, remained untouched. Everywhere else, the crimson tide continued to spread.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The apocalyptic disaster had spread beyond control, growing more devastating by the minute.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We're done for!" One of the generals collapsed into his chair, his face pale.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The command center erupted into chaos once again. These weren't ordinary generals. They could read the situation clearly now. The apocalypse was unstoppable, and they had been far too optimistic earlier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The gravity of the situation was written on everyone's faces. Gone were their usual commanding presence and cool composure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Marshal Byron," Quentin asked gravely, "this catastrophe is spreading faster than we anticipated. Even if we mobilized a million troops, I doubt we could turn the tide. What options do we have left?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Byron remained silent for a long moment, his eyes sweeping across the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I apologize, everyone, but I don't have some brilliant plan up my sleeve," he finally spoke. "What I do know is that we have to give it everything we've got&mdash;one last shot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We're fighting for our families, our friends, and our best soldiers... We can't back down now. We need to stand united and fight these monsters with everything we have!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And let's not forget about Yinson and those bastards from the Ghost who started all this. We'll only have a chance to protect our homes if we eliminate both the monsters and the ones who created them."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Byron then pulled up several satellite footage clips on the screen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Look here," he continued. "An hour ago, my security force formed multiple special ops teams. We've got enhanced soldiers equipped with combat exoskeletons and armor already clearing out the monsters around the command center."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We've secured complete control within a half-mile radius of headquarters," Byron reported. "All hostiles have been eliminated. Whether they were the living dead, zombies, or mutant creatures.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Plus, my First and Fifth Armies have moved into downtown Kingsdon. We're talking about 100,000 troops, over a thousand main battle tanks and armored vehicles, along with artillery units of all types.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I expect we'll have the situation in downtown Kingsdon under control within 24 hours."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The room buzzed with excitement at Byron's good news. Everyone's faces lit up, and excited chatter filled the room. Byron had proven himself once again&mdash;his quick thinking, rapid deployment, and the sheer combat effectiveness of his forces were truly remarkable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quentin jumped in with his own update. "My three armored divisions have secured two military bases and a major supply depot. We won't have to worry about ammo or supplies anytime soon."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This additional piece of good news gave everyone's morale another boost.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My 18th Division is moving toward Kingsdon at full speed!" one general announced enthusiastically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The 36th Airborne Division will drop into Kingsdon within three hours!" came another voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My 52nd Air Force Wing has fighters and bombers fueled and ready to go. Just waiting on Marshal Byron's order to provide air support to Kingsdon!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The room erupted into a chorus of voices, with everyone eager to contribute. Some were calling out plans to reinforce Kingsdon and other major cities, while others were coordinating to secure additional military supply bases.</span></p><div class="pagination">
