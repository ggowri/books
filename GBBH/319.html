Mr. Hawthorne said to stop! The Commander instructed us to look after Mr. Hawthorne, no slacking off."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The driver quickly stepped on the brakes, stopping right in front of Madelyn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Madelyn furrowed her brows slightly, eyeing the convoy warily, certain it belonged to some powerful figure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, the car door opened, and Alexander stepped out, smiling warmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is that you? What are you doing here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Alexander, Madelyn's face lit up with surprise and delight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Where are you headed? I'll give you a ride."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander offered with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blushing, Madelyn replied, "I'm heading to </span><span>Tijuanea</span><span>, just about to catch a flight. You must be busy; there's no need to take me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander paused for a moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Tijuanea</span><span>? I'm actually heading there too."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Really? What a coincidence!

That's impressive."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander simply smiled, leaving it unexplained.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They both got into the car and headed straight to the airport.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Along the way, Madelyn talked non-stop, and Alexander learned she was going to </span><span>Tijuanea</span><span> because a major client's funds were frozen by </span><span>Tijuanea</span><span> Bank, and she was going to handle it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the </span><span>Loscity</span><span> Airport...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After picking up their boarding passes, Alexander, Madelyn, and several of Quentin's attendants queued up for security checks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking about </span><span>Tijuanea</span><span> Bank's uncooperative attitude, Madelyn couldn't help but feel nervous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, she wasn't entirely without hope; she had a distant cousin, Roman Batts, who worked at </span><span>Tijuanea</span><span> Bank and was her only chance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing the worry on Madelyn's face, Alexander could tell what she was concerned about.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he could cure Quentin's grandson, he could ask the four-star general to help resolve Madelyn's issue.

I want an autograph!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A handsome young man in sunglasses was immediately surrounded by fans, causing the security line to be completely disrupted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's Marcos, the hottest pop star in </span><span>Tijuanea</span><span> right now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Madelyn commented indifferently, then shook her head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Marcos was a good singer and very handsome, with skin more delicate than most women's, Madelyn had no interest in celebrity fandom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander glanced at Marcos, his eyes showing a hint of disdain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Marcos, we'll love you forever!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A group of women holding bouquets and glow sticks screamed and cheered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ugh, can we get through security already?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Madelyn frowned tightly; these people were simply wasting time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Please move! Please make way!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander had been waiting impatiently and grabbed her hand, striding forward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Madelyn hadn't even reacted when she saw the crowded people ahead parting like waves hitting a rock, making way for them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feeling the warmth of Alexander's big hand, Madelyn's heart began to race, and her cheeks turned red.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had long been attracted to Alexander and wanted to pursue him, but recently hadn't found the chance to meet him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, just holding his hand made Madelyn feel as if she was intoxicated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcos, surrounded by a crowd, was suddenly pushed aside with a powerful force, and if it weren't for some fans blocking him, he would have fallen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander held Madelyn's hand, striding through the crowd with confidence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcos was about to curse, but then he saw Madelyn, and his eyes lit up, his gaze becoming intense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What a captivating woman!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Excuse me, please make way."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcos pushed aside the fans, eagerly pursuing Madelyn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once on the plane, Madelyn talked with the flight attendant to switch seats and happily sat next to Alexander, her beautiful face flushed.</span></p><div class="pagination">
