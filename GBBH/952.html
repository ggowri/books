  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gavin quickly yanked Grace back. "Enough already! You're only making things worse."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He turned to Alexander, his tone shifting to something much more polite</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne, I'm a member of the Ghost, and I have a solid relationship with General Thompson. I came to </span><span>Loscity</span><span> specifically to speak with you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander narrowed his eyes slightly, a dangerous glint flickering in them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gavin, sensing the tension, quickly added, "Please don't misunderstand. Not all of us in the Ghost think the same way. Sure, some might use force, but not me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What I'm proposing is simple. I want to offer you 30 billion for the exclusive rights to the magic powder in </span><span>Avalora</span><span>. What do you think?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander paused, giving the offer a moment to sink in. "And if I say no?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Grace could open her mouth, Gavin quickly raised a hand to stop her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a thoughtful expression, Gavin continued, "Look, Mr. Hawthorne, if I become the exclusive distributor, we can split the profits 50/50.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The market for this magic powder is massive, and you can't possibly handle it all on your own. Sharing the rights will make sure we're all making money in the long run and it'll keep the </span><span>more greedy</span><span> members of the Ghost from making things difficult."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander let out a small laugh, not fooled for a second. Gavin was trying to dress up a mix of bribery and subtle threats, but it was only a slightly more refined version of the same old game.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He paused again, pretending to think before he spoke.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll give you the rights, but it's going to cost you 50 billion. Not in cash, though. I want supplies, food, resources, things like that. I'll send you a list of what I need."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grace, clearly upset, crossed her arms and glared at him. "Why do you need so much?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gavin, visibly annoyed, turned sharply to her. "Shut up! If you don't stop, I'll deal with you myself."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grace shrank back, but she didn't stop glaring.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Turning back to Alexander, Gavin gave a smile that almost seemed too pleased with himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Deal. I'll arrange the supplies, and you send me the list. There's nothing I can't find.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As for the Ghost? Don't worry about them. Once I make a few calls to some old friends in big countries, and they agree to take the exclusive rights. Anyone trying to go against you will have no chance."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander just smirked. By the time Yinson's mess started, the magic powder would have become irrelevant. Gavin would soon realize just how badly he'd been played.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as he turned to leave, he stopped, sizing up Gavin once more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Lawson, I noticed you've got some old injuries. If you don't take care of them soon, they'll be the end of you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gavin froze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You... how did you know about that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He never imagined that Alexander was not only a formidable fighter but also someone who could see through his hidden wounds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No wonder the magic powder he developed was so potent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Grace, seething with rage, stepped forward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, how dare you say my grandfather doesn't have much time left? Get him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, over a dozen bodyguards, who had been lying in wait, surged forward, surrounding Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were all huge, muscles bulging, faces hard as stone, each one more than ready to </span><span>throw down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander didn't even blink, giving a smug smile. "I'm just giving your grandfather some respect. Otherwise, you guys wouldn't even be worth my time."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The tension in the air thickened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The leader of the bodyguards scowled, "Kid, don't get too cocky. There's always someone stronger, no matter how tough you think you are."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wasn't impressed by Alexander's confidence. In his eyes, Alexander looked like a regular young man, too skinny and too cocky to be a real threat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, you're asking for trouble. Keep talking like that, and you'll regret it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, tough guy. Say it again. Let's see what you're really made of."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were seasoned bodyguards, men who'd fought and killed in real battles. To them, Alexander was just some kid with a big mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander ignored their threats, shrugging as if they weren't even worth his attention.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're all wasting my time. Move or get out of my way."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a lazy flick of his hand, an invisible wave of energy hit the bodyguards like a freight train. Before they could react, they were sent stumbling, tripping over each other and crashing to the ground in a tangled mess.</span></p><div class="pagination">
