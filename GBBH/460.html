  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By the time Alexander got back to the master bedroom, it was already the middle of the night.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava lay face down on the bed, completely still, as if she were asleep.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Alexander knew better&mdash;she'd been watching earlier, her face flushed with embarrassment, clearly affected by what she saw between him and Rosalia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He smirked to himself, pretending nothing had happened as he got into bed and pulled Ava close, letting sleep take over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>.....</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next morning, Ava's phone started blaring before dawn broke.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She rubbed her eyes, reaching over to grab it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a short conversation, she hung up, her brow furrowed in worry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alex, Charlize is in critical condition&mdash;what do we do?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's expression turned serious right away. Charlize Collins had gotten those burns protecting Ashley.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What are we waiting for? Let's go to the hospital."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Twenty minutes later, they arrived at the hospital.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Charlize lay silently in the hospital bed. The beautiful face she once had was now only half intact&mdash;the other side burned black.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her body was covered in burn ointments, the dark paste making her look like charred wood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dr. Sherwood, the best doctor in </span><span>Loscity</span><span>, was overseeing her treatment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A group of nurses and doctors bustled around, all of them visibly tense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dr. Neal, the hospital director, stood by, eyes wide with concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew that if Charlize died here, the whole hospital would be in deep trouble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He anxiously asked, "Dr. Sherwood, how is the patient now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dr. Peter Sherwood shook his head, looking disheartened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The burns are too extensive. There's nothing more we can do. It's time to inform the family and make final arrangements."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dr. Neal felt his temper flare, about to lose it, when Alexander's voice cut through.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who says Charlize can't be saved? I'll take care of it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone turned to see Alexander and Ava rushing in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dr. Sherwood frowned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And just who are you? You think you can question my medical expertise?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander replied, his tone even.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dr. Sherwood, you might be the best doctor in the city, but if you can't save Charlize, I sure can."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dr. Sherwood snorted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you can actually save her, I'll become your student."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander shrugged. "If you want to be my student, we'll see if I'm in the mood to take you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dr. Sherwood looked like he couldn't decide whether to laugh or scream&mdash;this kid was unbelievably arrogant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dr. Neal recognized Alexander and Ava, his face paling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rumor had it even top military officials showed Alexander respect, and the Red Umbrella Group had lost to him. There was no way Dr. Neal would risk offending him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dr. Neal grabbed Dr. Sherwood's arm, pulling him back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dr. Sherwood, keep quiet, now's not the time for this."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dr. Sherwood fumed. "Dr. Neal, why are you stopping me? He's questioning our hospital's treatment, my skills, and I can't say a word?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I said zip it! I'm trying to help you here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dr. Neal's patience was thinning&mdash;he'd never dealt with someone so oblivious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne, if you'd like to help with the treatment, of course, you're welcome to. But Charlize's burns are extremely severe. Might I ask which medical school you graduated from?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dr. Neal asked cautiously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander replied calmly, "I never went to medical school, and I've never worked in a hospital. I developed my skills on my own."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dr. Neal was left speechless while Dr. Sherwood sneered, his expression filled with disdain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you can't help, get out of the way. Don't waste my time."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander waved his hand, and an invisible force shoved Dr. Sherwood and his team backward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dr. Sherwood tried to step forward, but Dr. Neal grabbed him, practically dragging him out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava's eyes filled with tears as she looked at Charlize's condition.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander motioned for Ava to leave as well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In moments, it was just him and Charlize in the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander looked at Charlize's burned body, and he couldn't help but think back to her once soft, beautiful form. A bitter feeling tightened his chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn you, Felix Vanderbilt. I swear, you'll pay for this."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander muttered a few curses before focusing, channeling the Force into his hands, </span><span>preparing to heal. He placed his hands gently on Charlize's body, beginning the treatment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was the first time Alexander had used his full Force to heal since becoming an Intermediate Warrior.</span></p><div class="pagination">
