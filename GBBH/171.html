  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was taken aback, thinking to himself, "Thank goodness Ava hasn't caught on."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two stunning beauties, Ava and Lara, surrounded him like stars orbiting a sun, and their laughter drew envious glances from everyone around.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were the goddesses of </span><span>Loscity</span><span>, the stuff of countless dreams for many men.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Typically, they kept others at arm's length, their aloofness making it nearly impossible to strike up a conversation with them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What made it even more infuriating was how Alexander seemed completely absorbed in his food and drink, as if nothing else mattered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava and Lara occasionally poured him drinks, and their attention only fueled the jealousy of the onlookers, many of whom would have gladly traded places with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Orion watched from a distance, his expression darkening.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite his irritation, he couldn't confront Alexander. After losing their last bet, he was forbidden from pursuing Ava any further.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hansen, care for a drink?" </span><span>Houtte</span><span> chimed in, raising his glass with a sly grin as he approached Orion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They clinked glasses, but Orion was clearly distracted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Houtte</span><span> chuckled. "You're worried about that little punk, Alexander, aren't you? Don't sweat it; he won't be strutting around for long."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Orion's eyes lit up for a moment before he shook his head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you guys planning to make a move on Alexander? He's got the magic powder formula under his control, and he's riding high right now. You'd find it tough to take him down."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Houtte's</span><span> smile widened, a glint of mischief in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What if I could get my hands on that magic powder formula?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Orion perked </span><span>up,</span><span> curiosity piqued. "What do you need from me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Houtte</span><span> leaned in, his voice low and conspiratorial. "I've heard the Hansen family has invested in some lucrative ventures&mdash;renewable energy, artificial intelligence, short video platforms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Those are gold mines.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If I manage to snag the magic powder formula, how about I get a stake in the Hansen family's businesses?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Orion's expression shifted, his confidence wavering.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those emerging industries were cash cows, and the Hansen family had poured immense resources into nurturing them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were on the brink of reaping the rewards, and letting the Cripples get involved could spell disaster.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Orion hesitate, </span><span>Houtte</span><span> clapped a hand on his shoulder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Listen, if you let me in, I'll get rid of Lara for you and help you become the head of the Hansen family."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Really?" Orion's interest was clearly piqued.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While he held a certain advantage in the Hansen family, he wasn't the top heir.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Ralph decided to pass the title to Lara, he would face significant opposition.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Houtte</span><span> thumped his chest confidently. "Orion, you guys know how to run a legitimate business, but we Cripples excel at getting our hands dirty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And we've got the Godfather, known as 'SATAN,' backing us."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Orion steeled himself, determination flashing in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, I'm in! If you can get the magic powder formula from Alexander and help </span><span>me</span><span> take over the Hansen family, I'll open up the entire Hansen family business to you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Houtte</span><span> was over the moon, clinking glasses with Orion in a show of solidarity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Alexander had noticed </span><span>Houtte</span><span> and Orion huddled together, whispering conspiratorially.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Whatever scheme they were plotting, he didn't care.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the face of his overwhelming power, all their conspiracies would crumble like sandcastles against the tide.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Alexander finished his meal, Oscar emerged from the back, a broad smile lighting up his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He waved cheerfully at Alexander before stepping up to take the helm of the auction. It was clear he was taking this event very seriously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Alexander caught a whiff of several powerful presences concealed within the private booths. Clearly, these individuals were the elite of the Kaylon, and the atmosphere surrounding them was charged with an undeniable tension.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Surrounding them were more than twenty imposing figures, clearly there for the security of the auction items.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inwardly, Alexander mused to himself about Kaylon's impressive strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Oscar announced with an air of enthusiasm, "Ladies and gentlemen. The Kaylon warmly welcomes you to tonight's auction!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We've carefully prepared a selection of exquisite jewelry and invaluable antiques. May you all find the treasures you seek!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Oscar's voice trailing off, a stunning female auctioneer stepped onto the stage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd erupted into enthusiastic applause, signaling that the auction was officially underway.</span></p><div class="pagination">
