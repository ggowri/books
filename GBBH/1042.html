  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We should exchange contacts. I hope you'll keep your promise!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Keith and Kiki exchanged contact info, he urged Kiki to leave quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you, Mr. Robinson. Thank you, Miss," Kiki said, tears welling up in her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Flustered, she hurriedly put on her clothes</span><span>. Then </span><span>her gaze fell on the USB drive on the computer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Keith chuckled, then casually </span><span>pulled</span><span> the USB </span><span>drive </span><span>out of the computer and </span><span>put</span><span> it into his pocket.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The drive was obviously important to Kiki, so he'd make sure to </span><span>watch</span><span> it thoroughly later</span><span>, haha.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing that the USB </span><span>drive </span><span>had been taken</span><span> away</span><span>, Kiki could only leave. She knew there was nothing she could do.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Keith turned and cast a cold, piercing look at Decker.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Please, don't kill me, Mr. Robinson! I have money</span><span>! </span><span>How much do you need? I can give you</span><span> 50 </span><span>million dollars. Is that enough?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, no... I'll give you a million, a million dollars! This is Sakra Society's money... </span><span>Please j</span><span>ust let me go," Decker pleaded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was desperate to stay alive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew that as long as he </span><span>survived</span><span>, he'd have a chance to turn things around</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He'd </span><span>find a way to get the money back and then kill Keith.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Keith's voice was as cold as ice. "If you </span><span>listen to me</span><span>, I won't kill you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sure, sure. I'll </span><span>do what you say</span><span>! I'll </span><span>listen to you! </span><span>You want Cyclops' information, don't you?" Decker blurted out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Keith sneered, playing with his knife in his hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Cyclops' information</span><span> is not enough for me</span><span>. I want every </span><span>personal </span><span>file on Sakra Society's members, including details on </span><span>your president</span><span>, Yinson White!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Decker was stunned, stuttering, "You... you want all the information on Sakra Society's members? And Mr. White's information? </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>No, that's impossible! I can't give you that... </span><span>I</span><span>f I do</span><span> it</span><span>, I'll </span><span>die sooner or later</span><span>... Ah!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before he could finish</span><span> his words</span><span>, Keith </span><span>punched him badly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Decker stumbled backward, clut</span><span>ching his swollen face, blood spilling from his nose.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Keith placed his foot on Decker's chest, the knife hovering over Decker's throat as he threatened, "You want to stay loyal to Sakra Society, huh? Fine, let's start with a few cuts. Let's see how much you can take."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, Keith drew the knife across Decker's chest, blood pouring out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Decker screamed in pain, thrashing around like a fish stranded on land.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If someone finds your dismembered </span><span>corpse</span><span> tomorrow, do you think the police </span><span>can</span><span> solve the case?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Keith taunted, pressing the knife against Decker's body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Decker shrieked, "Don't kill me! I beg you</span><span>!</span><span> I'll give you whatever you want... </span><span>A</span><span>ll the files</span><span>! A</span><span>ll the information</span><span>! </span><span>I'll give you everything</span><span>!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just please spare my life. Don't tell anyone that I handed over all the files. Only the three of us should know about this."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Keith scoffed and kicked Decker in the side.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Asshole</span><span>, you only understand the hard way, huh?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Decker, face contorted with fear and pain, scrambled to his feet and shakily opened his computer, entering an encrypted space.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He copied all the members' files from Sakra Society, along with information on Yinson, onto the USB drive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Robinson, here's everything you asked for, including Cyclops' info... It's all here. You've got to keep your word. Please don't hurt me..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Decker looked at Keith with pitiful eyes, pleading.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Keith took the USB</span><span> drive</span><span>, glanced at it, and didn't say a word.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Paula quickly leaned in and whispered in Keith's ear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You can't keep him alive. I know him too well. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>He'll take revenge. If you don't kill him now, he'll run straight to Sakra Society and report us. We'll be finished."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Decker exploded with rage, pointing at Paula and cursing, "You bitch... You're so cruel, trying to kill me</span><span>!</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Robinson, don't listen to this </span><span>fucking bitch!</span><span>" he screamed. "I've already leaked all the secrets I knew. I </span><span>won't</span><span> betray you! </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Please, don't listen to her!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>She's an evil witch</span><span>! Mr. Robinson, don't you see</span><span> it</span><span>? You can't trust her</span><span>!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"S</span><span>he betrayed me, </span><span>and </span><span>she'll betray you too</span><span>!</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Keith backing her, Paula wasn't afraid. Instead, she shoved Decker back with force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You old bastard, you'll report us to Sakra Society, and I'm not letting you off the hook!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
