  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who are you? What do you want to do? I have money... I'll give you as much as you want... Please let me go..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amid screamed, Alexander grabbed Jagger's throat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jagger begged for mercy desperately, wanting to use the money to buy his life, but Alexander had a cold expression and ignored him completely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Crack!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jagger's cervical vertebra was broken, he rolled his eyes and stopped moving.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander threw him to the ground like trash. As for the woman, she had already fainted from fright.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He used his All-seeing Eyes to scan the surroundings and immediately discovered a black safe hidden inside the thick walls.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smiled, thinking that Jagger must have hidden his most important assets here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>People like Jagger were very cunning. He had been operating in Mandale Town for so long and had earned a lot of money, but he would not deposit all his assets in the bank. He would hide some of it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Opening the safe certainly wasn't a problem for Alexander, so he casually swung out his lightsaber.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sizzle!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The lock core was burned by the lightsaber, but things inside were intact.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he opened the door of the safe, he saw dozens of thick stacks of brand-new dollars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were also several palm-sized black cloth bags next to it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander opened one of them and found that it was filled with top-quality gems of various colors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Very good. Although there are no top-grade gems, these bags of high-grade gems are worth hundreds of millions of dollars. It's worth the trip."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smiled and talked to himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He found a bag, put all the money and jewels in it, then carried Jagger's body and ran out of the building in a flash.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bang!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander took out Jagger's gun and fired several shots at the corpse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then he threw Jagger's body at the entrance of the building and disappeared into the night like lightning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sharp sound of gunfire startled everyone, and the Glory Association was in chaos.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Guards and high-ranking members of the Glory Association all gathered towards the building.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What happened? Why did Mr. Taylor die?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Taylor is dead? Who did it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone in the Glory Association was shocked when they saw this tragic scene.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jagger was lying on the ground covered in blood, his face was pale, his eyes were wide open, and he looked scared. It was obvious that he had been dead for a long time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander did not go far but hid on the rooftop of a building opposite, overlooking everything from above.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although it was dark, he could see everything clearly because of his All-seeing Eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>More than a dozen high-ranking figures of the Glory Association were present. They looked at Jagger, who was dead, with different expressions and complicated emotions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Some people looked angry and vowed to avenge Jagger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Some people were shocked and angry and were secretly thinking about who should take the position of president.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Some people sneered and prepared to watch the show.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Glory Association was one of the most powerful forces in Mandale Town, with annual net profits reaching hundreds of millions or even billions of dollars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Countless people were jealous of Jagger's position as the president, but due to his cunning and majesty, they dared not take action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now it was different. Jagger had been killed inexplicably.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although no one knew who did it, the position of president had been vacated and every capable member could fight for it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anyone qualified to compete for the position of president would not miss this rare opportunity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A black man looked at the guard fiercely and cursed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You are a bunch of rubbish! How on earth did you protect Mr. Taylor? Mr. Taylor was killed here. This is a shocking scandal. The whole of Mandale Town will laugh at us.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I declare that no one is allowed to leave until I find out the truth of this matter! If anyone tries to leave by force, he must be a suspect."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the black man's command, his men sprang into action, surrounding a dozen high-ranking figures.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A burly man immediately roared, "Joseph, what the hell do you want to do? I think you don't want to find the murderer but to kill us all, and then you can be the president, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before he finished speaking, he waved his hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His men behind him drew their guns and confronted Joseph's subordinates.</span></p><div class="pagination">
