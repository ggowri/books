  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the last possible moment, just as Sienna was about to black out completely, Alexander finally released his hold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a dull thud, Sienna collapsed onto the stage like a discarded piece of trash.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sienna lay face-down on the ground, her disheveled hair covering her face. The woman who had carried herself like royalty just moments ago now looked completely wrecked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her chest heaved with desperate gasps for air, like a fish thrown onto dry land. Each ragged breath echoed her panic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Relief flooded through her body at simply being alive. The feeling of stepping back from death's door left her shaking with residual terror.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander towered over Sienna's crumpled form, his cold gaze boring down at her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're no different from the trash on the ground," he said, his voice sharp with disgust. "I don't know where you get off acting so superior.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you weren't a woman, I'd have done way worse. Get out of </span><span>Loscity</span><span>. Don't let me see your face here again."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The killing intent radiating from Alexander pressed down on Sienna like a mountain, making her whole body tremble. She didn't dare breathe a word.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd's attention locked onto Alexander as he publicly humiliated Sienna. The spectacle had everyone frozen in place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Rhodes family's reputation as the </span><span>Newbrook</span><span> elite was well-known. While they weren't quite at the top of high society, they were definitely old money.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nobody could believe Alexander would come at Sienna so hard, showing zero respect for her status or gender. The ice-cold takedown had left everyone stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was indeed a real badass.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd watched Alexander with newfound respect. This was what a real man looked like&mdash;someone who backed up his words with action. Their eyes reflected a mix of awe and reverence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The piercing wail of police sirens cut through the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Several patrol cars screeched to a halt near the stage. A team of officers rushed forward, quickly forming a protective circle around Sienna.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their leader commanded attention&mdash;a middle-aged man in a crisp uniform and polished black boots who carried himself with an air of authority. His presence demanded respect as he strode onto the stage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A squad of alert, ready-for-action officers flanked him on all sides.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sienna's whole body sagged with relief at the sight of the police. The color returned to her face as if she'd just been pulled back from death's door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her eyes lit up with recognition and joy when she spotted the lead officer. She frantically waved her arms to get his attention.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Christopher, help me! This psycho tried to kill me!" She pointed wildly at Alexander. "Look what he did to all these people. They got hurt trying to protect me. You need to arrest him right now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sienna scrambled toward the officers, practically crawling in her desperation to reach them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Someone tried to kill you?" The police captain's forehead creased with concern as he surveyed the bloody scene. His eyes swept over the injured men&mdash;some with black eyes, others with broken arms and legs. Every single one of them had taken a serious beating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As </span><span>Christopher</span><span> studied Sienna, he took in the full extent of her injuries. Her once-perfect face had swollen up badly, with angry red fingermarks dotted across both her cheeks and throat. Her hair was a total mess, and her designer dress looked like it had been through a washing machine. It was definitely not the polished socialite look she usually went for.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sienna, what the hell happened here? I want to know who's got the nerve to pull this kind of stunt in my city!" Christopher Morales' voice boomed with authority and barely contained rage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the Deputy Chief of the </span><span>Loscity</span><span> Police Department and Sienna's relative, Christopher had always maintained close ties with the Rhodes family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He'd consistently looked out for Sienna's interests, which made this situation even more infuriating. The fact that this had happened at a music festival under his jurisdiction was a personal affront.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Christopher's eyes swept over the scene, taking in the numerous injured men. In his </span><span>mind, these guys had heroically tried to protect Sienna, and whoever had done this to them needed to face serious consequences.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It was him! Right there!" Sienna's confidence came rushing back as she jabbed her finger toward Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her hatred for Alexander had reached its boiling point. She literally wanted him dead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The fact that he'd shown her mercy just moments ago meant absolutely nothing to her. All she could think about was revenge, plotting how she'd make him pay ten times over for every bit of humiliation she'd suffered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the Rhodes family's golden child and a musical prodigy, Sienna had lived her entire life on a pedestal. People had always looked up to her with admiration, even envy. She wasn't used to anything less than complete reverence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But today, Alexander had utterly humiliated her in front of everyone at the festival. The public takedown would become industry gossip, destroying the untouchable image she'd carefully built over the years.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sienna's blood boiled at the thought. She needed payback. Her reputation depended on it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Christopher's support gave her a new spark of hope. With his help, she could turn this around. The idea of seeing Alexander behind bars brought a vindictive smile to her face. That would teach him a good lesson.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry, Sienna. I will make sure he pays for this!" Christopher's voice shook with rage as he stormed toward Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander barely seemed to notice them. He was focused on comforting Ava and Ashley, acting like Christopher and Sienna didn't even exist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But when Christopher finally got a clear look at Alexander's face, his confident stride faltered. His body went rigid as if someone had hit his pause button. The blood drained from his face as recognition dawned.</span></p><div class="pagination">
