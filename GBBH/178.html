  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carifona</span><span>, San Ocano City, in this bustling metropolis where every square foot was worth its weight in gold, the Cripples headquarters took up residence in a towering skyscraper, a testament to their formidable power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eddie Caine, the head of the Cripples, received the news almost immediately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes glued to the video of </span><span>Houtte's</span><span> mangled body and the unfortunate souls around </span><span>Houtte</span><span>&mdash;some dead, others maimed&mdash;rage boiled within him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>First, Joseph had been turned to ash, and now </span><span>Houtte</span><span> was gone, two key players in the Cripples' operations snuffed out without a trace of justice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander had taken out so many of his men, yet somehow, it was all deemed self-defense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eddie's mind raced with thoughts of revenge. "Should I retaliate against Alexander?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thought gave him a headache.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Have we got any leads?" he asked, his voice icy as he surveyed the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One of his aides stepped forward, eager to report.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Caine, it appears that Alexander might be the chairman of the Saint Group and potentially the illegitimate son of the Godfather, the Reaper himself. He's currently in a power struggle with Guzman from the Brilliant Group over inheritance."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What!?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eddie's face darkened, a storm brewing in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though the Cripples had the backing of the Godfather, known by the nickname </span><span>SATAN, Eddie had no desire to cross the Godfather, who was known as Reaper.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He paced the room like a caged tiger, back and forth, weighing his options.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get in touch with Alexander. If he's willing to cut the price of magic powder by twenty percent, we can let bygones be bygones. I'll ensure nothing like this happens again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And keep an eye on him&mdash;let's see what he does next."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ultimately, Eddie decided against his initial plan to eliminate Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, at the police station, Gary's face was ashen as he stared blankly at his brother David's lifeless body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The officers exchanged uneasy glances, unsure of what to say.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The lead officer cautiously broke the silence. "Mr. Gary Federer, our investigation suggests that David's death was the result of a car accident."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gary slammed his fist onto the table, his voice rising with fury. "No way! It wasn't an accident!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You worthless fools, what good are you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The officers shifted uncomfortably but remained silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, Ava and Alexander emerged from the interview room, having just finished their statements.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander shot Gary a cold glance, his eyes sharp as daggers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gary glared at Alexander's retreating figure, muttering under his breath, "</span><span>Houtte</span><span> ambushed Ava and Alexander, but they turned the tables on him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"David's death happened just seven or eight hundred yards away&mdash;there's no way they're not involved!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The lead officer smirked, saying, "So you're saying David was one of the masterminds behind the ambush and got taken out by Alexander?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's a stretch, considering the implications for David and the Federer family's reputation."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gary fell silent, frustration bubbling within him as he stormed out of the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Gary Federer, the Saint Group is a formidable force. Are we being reckless here?" asked an older man resembling a butler, Dominic Marsan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gary's face hardened. "It's too late for second thoughts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"David's death is a disgrace to the Federer family. If I don't avenge him, how can we ever hold our ground in </span><span>Loscity</span><span>?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Plus, I need the formula for that magic powder&mdash;the Federer family's future depends on it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His expression was that of a vengeful spirit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dominic wisely chose not to press further, knowing Gary's relentless nature and the stakes involved for the Federer family's honor and future.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Take a shortcut and block their path!" Gary ordered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Several cars revved up, entering full chase mode.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Ava and Alexander approached the </span><span>Bevery</span><span> Hills mansion, a convoy of vehicles suddenly surged out to intercept them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's Gary's cars! The license plate numbers are all sequential eights," Ava said, her voice laced with concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander calmly said, "Stay in the car and don't get out, no matter what happens.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry, Charlize is on her way. She'll keep an eye on you from the shadows."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Charlize had swiftly established a shooting position on the rooftop of a nearby building.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sniper scope was already zeroed in on their location. Alexander had given the order: anyone who dared to approach Ava's car would be taken out on the spot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava leaned over and planted a quick kiss on Alexander's cheek.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just be careful out there!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He chuckled. "After this is over, make sure you're all cleaned up and waiting for me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava's cheeks flushed at the implication, and she nodded shyly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander stepped out of the car, exuding calmness as he faced Gary and his crew.</span></p><div class="pagination">
