  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lucas was so terrified that he didn't dare meet Alexander's gaze, stumbling over his words in fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I... I just... just..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop right there!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A sudden shout cut through the tension.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Levi stepped forward; eyes blazing as he glared furiously at Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're not part of our organization. What gives you the right to lay a hand on one of our brothers? Are you looking to get yourself killed?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that one line, Levi had made Alexander an enemy of the entire organization.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Around a hundred skilled fighters stood at the ready, and no matter how strong Alexander might be, Levi was confident they could teach this arrogant young man a harsh lesson.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander couldn't help but laugh at the absurdity. He had just been designated as the heir to the Godfather himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These people should have been his subordinates, yet here they were, challenging him again and again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a flash, Alexander appeared in front of Levi, grasping him by the throat and lifting him off the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What did you say? I'm looking for death? Who here is really asking for it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Levi's face turned ashen as he struggled for air, unable to respond.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lucas, enraged, began to shout, "Everyone, get him! Take him down!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chaos erupted as the crowd, already holding a grudge against Alexander, surged forward with a battle cry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In all, about ten fighters lunged for Alexander&mdash;half of them powered metahumans, the other half highly skilled martial artists.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They charged with such intensity that it looked as though Alexander would be buried under the onslaught of bodies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander scoffed. If these people weren't meant to be his own future subordinates, he would have crippled them on the spot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the dozen warriors encircled him, a faint smirk of disdain appeared on Alexander's lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as he was about to strike, a sudden, invisible mental force hit him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander hadn't anticipated that one of the metahumans in the crowd was capable of psychic attacks and had launched a mental assault on him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Immediately, his mind felt frozen, and his body grew rigid, as though trapped in the grip of arctic ice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kneel!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A brutal voice echoed in Alexander's mind. The metahuman with the hypnotic power was formidable, already a level-two metahuman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get out of my head!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander channeled his power, releasing it in an explosive surge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The violent power surged like a raging storm, crashing toward the opponent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, his mental strength was torn apart, and a scream erupted from the crowd as someone fell heavily to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Simultaneously, a dozen fighters who had nearly reached Alexander were blasted backward as though struck by a hurricane, landing meters away in a painful heap.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their faces turned pale with shock. They had charged him together, confident in overwhelming Alexander, but had instead been effortlessly crushed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It felt as though Alexander's strength bore down on them like a mountain, an unstoppable force that couldn't be challenged.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander walked calmly toward Levi, Lucas, and the others, his gaze filled with scorn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To Levi and Lucas, they were nothing more than ants on the ground, and Alexander was a towering giant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kneel! And I might just spare your lives."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's words cracked through the air like thunder, and his fierce power crashed </span><span>over them like tidal waves, obliterating any remaining defiance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Levi and Lucas, closest to him, instantly crumbled, collapsing to their knees on the spot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Around them, the weaker onlookers couldn't stop themselves from sinking to their knees.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Defy me again, and I'll see you all dead!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's voice was chilling, cold as ice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Levi and Lucas screamed in agony, feeling as though their bodies were tearing apart, small cracks appearing on their skin through which crimson blood seeped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Within moments, the two of them were soaked in blood, looking like figures drenched in red.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, not a single person among the hundred dared to aid Levi and Lucas. Their minds were filled only with the image of Alexander, radiating an unassailable authority and deadly intent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A profound fear of Alexander grew within each of them. The weaker ones prostrated themselves on the ground while even the stronger fighters lowered their heads in dread.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had never encountered anyone so terrifying, someone who made even Shadow and the Godfather himself seem less frightening by comparison.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Son, a great battle lies ahead. Please, for my sake, spare these fools."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, an urgent voice broke the silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The voice came from an elderly man with silver hair, seated in a wheelchair, being pushed forward by Shadow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander's body tensed, and he looked toward his father, his expression complicated.</span></p><div class="pagination">
