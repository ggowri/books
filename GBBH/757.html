  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Go to hell!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bruno roared, disappearing in a blink of an eye at a speed that left one astounded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In Alexander's All-seeing Eyes, everyone's movements would slow down, but Bruno's speed was almost normal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So fast that he left a blur in the air, tracing a beautiful trajectory, Bruno appeared beside Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're courting death!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander no longer held back, for Bruno's strength had broken through once more. He wouldn't give him another chance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Force surged, and his Lightsaber stabbed out like lightning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bruno, like a nimble snake, twisted his body weirdly and managed to dodge the attack perfectly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Almost simultaneously, Alexander punched Bruno square in the chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Like a nail hit by a swung hammer, Bruno was sent flying, spewing blood in mid-air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Bruno hit the ground, Alexander appeared in a flash, his whip-like leg striking Bruno.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bruno vomited blood again and fell heavily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, he did not retreat. Each time he was knocked down, he stood up against all odds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For the sake of fulfilling his mother's wish, for his own convictions, and for the woman he secretly loved, Bruno unleashed an unimaginable willpower.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His will was as solid as a rock. Even with broken limbs, injuries all over, and blood dripping, Bruno did not submit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Alexander frowned, appreciating Bruno. Under different circumstances, he believed Bruno and he could have been great friends.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alas, the stronger Bruno's will, the more Alexander felt he must kill him, not giving him a chance to turn the tables.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sound of crisp bone fractures rang out. Both of Bruno's legs were broken. He fell heavily to the ground, unable to stand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander looked at him indifferently, his expression grave and complex.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He respected such an adversary, even though Bruno was misguided.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander slowly walked up to Bruno, looking down at him from above.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bruno was no longer recognizable, with broken limbs, lying on the ground, his chest still slightly heaving.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He glared viciously at Alexander, bruised and swollen yet grinning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're wounded too... If you give me another five years to enhance my strength, I will definitely be able to kill you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander looked down at his chest, where several bloodstains had seeped through.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was the price Bruno paid with his one intact arm. Eventually, even that arm was broken by Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, you won't live long either. The Mafia, City of Sorcery, and Sakra Society have joined forces. You're doomed. If you're a man, stop tormenting me and kill me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bruno closed his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's eyes narrowed, his violent, murderous intent rising.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He felt an urge to crush Bruno's head under his foot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Bruno wasn't dead, he would definitely be a thorn in his side!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander stepped on Bruno's chest with his foot and said coldly, "You're both pitiful and hateful. Let me tell you again. Ava is happy with me. You will never have her in this life."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bruno was so angry he felt like vomiting blood again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, Alexander's gaze swept the woods behind him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So you have reinforcements. Stop skulking around and show yourself!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A sudden change occurred, and a foul gust of wind rushed towards him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A figure pounced in front of Alexander, who kicked out like lightning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was kicked flying, breaking a small tree, and crashing to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What kind of monster is this!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander saw its face and body, highly decomposed, with maggots wriggling in the rotten flesh. It was like a living dead person.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The living dead was kicked by Alexander but only had a few ribs broken in the chest. It actually got up as if nothing happened and lunged at Alexander again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, several more living dead people rushed out of the woods, more than half attacking Alexander. Two others headed towards Bruno, who was lying on the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander wielded his Lightsaber with extraordinary momentum.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite their fearlessness of death and lack of pain, the living dead could not withstand the Lightsaber.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the blink of an eye, three living dead were dismembered by Alexander, and Bruno was dragged into the depths of the woods by two living dead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bruno, severely injured and defenseless, let out a shrill, heart-wrenching scream.</span></p><div class="pagination">
