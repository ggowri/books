The position of Godfather was within his reach once he dealt with the second brother.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shadow contacted Alexander. The leader's health was getting worse and worse, and the Mafia Godfather, "SATAN", was eyeing the position covetously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although the leader was called "Reaper", his control and organization over his subordinates was not as strong as the Mafia. Except for Shadow around him and some direct subordinates, all others were divided into three groups, the Saint Group, the Brilliant Group and the Red Umbrella Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Felix surrendered to the Mafia and gave up some of his interests, they might cooperate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that time, Alexander would have to face the siege of three forces. He was not afraid, but it would bring great danger to the people around him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Therefore, Alexander decided to take the initiative and eliminate the threat!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander had been waiting these two days. Augusta came from Treasure Island with a team of elite soldiers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Kaylon obtained accurate intelligence and roughly determined the location of the </span><span>Morris family's headquarters, which was in a basin in the northern mountains.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In this age of satellites, the Morris family's estate could not be completely hidden.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Morris family, Felix, I'm coming!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander had already sentenced them to death in his heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The northern mountains were surrounded by deserts and had a cold climate. And some peaks were always covered with snow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because of the harsh environment, it was sparsely populated and desolate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Master, you really won't take me with you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosalia was anxious and worried.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander patted her perky butt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said, "Augusta will bring people to follow me. Your most important task is to protect Ashley. Wait for me to come back."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes. No one can hurt Ashley!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosalia's expression was determined.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Augusta said, "Boss, good choice!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Augusta was so excited that he became even stronger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He already possessed second-level speed and strength abilities, making him a rare composite ability user. This was closely related to the meditation method Alexander taught him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I spent a lot of effort to train them. Each of them has strong wilderness survival skills. They are all search experts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And we can use helicopters to search from the air. How about that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Augusta reported with great enthusiasm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Behind him were several off-road vehicles and more than twenty burly men in uniforms and fully armed. Each of them had a strong physique. And they were all carrying a full set of equipment for survival in the wild.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smiled with satisfaction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Very good! I heard from Cloe that you and William have made great contributions and have swept 80% of the territory of Treasure Island."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Augusta nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said, "The Red Umbrella Group is now left with only its headquarters building and some area around it. If you hadn't ordered us to keep them as bait, we would have wiped them out long ago!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander chuckled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said, "If I destroy the Morris family, but fail to kill Felix, do you think he will hide in Treasure Island?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"After all, he still doesn't know that I got the Brilliant Group!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Augusta showed his murderous intent. "If I meet Felix, I will break his neck!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander ordered, "Follow me. I will contact you if I need you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, Alexander didn't even take the wilderness survival backpack and walked leisurely towards the northern mountains.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone was speechless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They knew that Alexander was powerful, but they did not believe that anyone could enter the dangerous northern mountains unarmed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander might die!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But their instructor, Augusta, said nothing, just stared at Alexander's back with a complicated expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They just watched Alexander drift away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He quickly disappeared. And Augusta waved his hand quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Everyone, follow him. Keep your distance."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The others didn't take it seriously at first. They were driving, and Alexander was walking. They should be faster.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even on the mountain road, their off-road speed reached thirty miles per hour, but they never saw Alexander's back.</span></p><div class="pagination">
