  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The guarding general of Campbell was Cary Drucker. He had his head wrapped in a turban, with a fat face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing the sneer, Cary suddenly stood up and shouted, "Xhantao is a great and ancient country with thousands of years of history. How dare you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Several people burst out laughing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rodney's face turned red. He forcefully pulled Cary to sit down, hoping Fermin would send troops as soon as possible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fermin's expression was solemn. He nodded and said, "We have sufficient supplies. Speed is of the essence in war. Moses!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moses Mulligan, the middle-aged general, stood up and responded respectfully, "Mr. Schneier!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fermin said, "I order you to be the vanguard. Lead your troops to scout 15 miles ahead. I will lead the main army right behind you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moses replied, "Yes, Mr. Schneier!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The army marched day and night, rushing towards Hamish.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Along the way, the land was barren for thousands of miles. Corpses of men, women, and children could often be seen everywhere. There were piles of human heads and bodies, men whose skins had been peeled off, and naked dead women. Even babies were nailed to the ground with wooden spikes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing this bloody scene, Alexander was burning with anger, gritting his teeth and saying, "These Risunese are devils!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Five days later, the army arrived at Miriam Mountain in Xhantao.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rodney nodded respectfully to Fermin and said, "Mr. Schneier, after passing through this Hero Gorge, Hamish is less than 160 miles to the west."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hero Gorge was about three miles long and over 10 feet wide, winding and twisting. On both sides were steep cliffs more than 100 feet high, with jagged rocks It was extremely dangerous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fermin suddenly burst out laughing and shouted, "Dismount! Set up camp 6 miles away from the gorge entrance."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Schneier! Why stop?" Rodney was suddenly startled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Risunese must have an ambush here!" Fermin sneered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Deep in Hero Gorge, a figure was sitting on a huge rock on the top of one side of the cliff. It was Frieza Mank. He wore a spiked helmet with two ferocious spikes on both sides. He had a square face, and big triangular slanting eyes with strange and small pupils. There was a combat power detector on his left eye. He was short, with hands like ape claws, and was dressed in a striped armor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A warrior rushed over in a hurry, knelt on one knee, and said loudly, "Mr. Mank, those Hrodvik soldiers are setting up camp. It seems they won't pass through Hero Gorge!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmm? Fermin is really something." Frieza's voice was shrill and cold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, Frieza rolled his eyes and gave a sinister laugh. "He probably doesn't know..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the main tent of the Hrodvik army camp outside Hero Gorge, Rodney was very anxious. "Mr. Schneier, if you don't send troops, Hamish is in great danger!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A contempt look appeared in Fermin's eyes, and he burst out laughing. "Hero Gorge is less than 160 miles away from Hamish. The Risunese must have an ambush. Calm down. The Risunese only have a million soldiers, and my army has 500 thousand soldiers. When strong, feign weakness; when weak, feign strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if we keep camping here and don't go to Hamish, the Risunese will still send troops to defend Hero Gorge. In this way, the Risunese won't have enough soldiers to besiege Hamish. Then, the danger to Hamish will be resolved."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But..." Rodney hesitated. He forced a smile and left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Rodney leave and there being no outsiders in the tent, Alexander whispered in Fermin's ear, "Mr. Schneier, the Teleportation Plate has been set up in the forest 60 miles east of Hero Gorge. It can teleport us to a place 15 miles outside Campbell."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Good!" Fermin nodded, his expression serious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander hesitated for a moment and continued, "Mr. Schneier, since the Risunese have an ambush, we can send people to provoke them to fight, and then only lose but not win to make them arrogant. At night, they may come to raid our camp! Then, we can..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fermin looked at Alexander with appreciation. "Not bad. Alexander, you're proficient in the art of war. It's a waste to have you as a guard."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Schneier, you flatter me!" Alexander smiled modestly, thinking, "I have watched countless war movies. The founding emperor of a country was a genius in military strategy. If there were something like crossing Hero Gorge four times, that would be interesting."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fermin issued orders and asked the soldiers to beat the drums. All the officers would take turns to go and provoke the enemy to fight, allowing only defeat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He set up traps and other things in the camp, just waiting for the enemies to come and come to their doom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the top of the cliff of Hero Gorge, two Risunese men stood in front of Frieza.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One was short, about the size of an eight- or nine-year-old child, dressed in black short clothes, with a character on his left chest. His face was covered with a black cloth, and he had a long and narrow saber on his back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The other was burly, wearing a gray outfit, with a long and a short narrow saber hanging on both sides of his waist.</span></p><div class="pagination">
