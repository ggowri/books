  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the corridor, the guards were knocked out one by one by Alexander before they could even raise the alarm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's dark pupils were emitting an enchanting glow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had an aura of supreme power, which made people feel afraid.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander even directly hypnotized those Rottweilers without fighting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, Alyssa and a dozen other people were all staring intently at the large LCD screen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No intruders were found, and everything seemed calm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Perry, I think that guy was just bragging. Look how long it's been, but no one has come in."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Some people couldn't bear it anymore and started to complain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We are on high alert. He couldn't sneak in. He must have entered by chance before."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"With this level of security, it's impossible to get in by force, let alone sneak in!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone was talking about it without respect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They thought it would be a fantasy for Alexander to sneak in under such strict security measures.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amid the discussions, Alyssa remained calm, but she did not stop them from talking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She still maintained her confidence and expectations in Alexander, hoping that he could sneak in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Alexander made it, the Axe would be saved!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alyssa couldn't explain why she was confident. Maybe it was because of her intuition. After so many years of struggling, she thought intuition was the most reliable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hasn't he started yet?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alyssa finally couldn't sit still anymore, so she picked up her phone and called Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the phone beeped for a long time, but no one answered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What the hell was Alexander doing?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alyssa frowned. This was totally illogical. Something must have happened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Could it be that Alexander had already come in?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alyssa was suddenly very excited, and a smile appeared on her face involuntarily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this time, Alexander had already arrived at the door of the conference room in a leisurely manner.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were eight fully armed guards at the door. When they saw Alexander suddenly appear, they were so shocked that they opened their mouths wide.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The captain was about to stop Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander gently pointed his finger at the captain's forehead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The captain was stunned for a second, then fell to the ground with his eyes closed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The other guards were knocked down by Alexander one after another before they could sound the alarm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this time, the people in the conference room also saw the image on the LCD screen, and there was an uproar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Crack!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander pushed open the door of the conference room and walked in calmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone was shocked, staring at Alexander with incredible eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was composed as if he had just done something insignificant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Alyssa, who believed in Alexander, was speechless. Under such strict defense, Alexander reached the door silently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>More than a dozen pairs of eyes were staring at the surveillance screen, but they didn't notice Alexander at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was a miracle!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alyssa couldn't suppress the doubts in her heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne, you are amazing. How did you do it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>More than a dozen pairs of eyes were focused on Alexander's face. They were waiting for his explanation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander glanced at everyone and smiled indifferently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't care about this. You just need to know that I can complete the plan, and you just need to follow my arrangements."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alyssa nodded vigorously with excitement and was very excited.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one minded that Alexander didn't tell them about the secret behind this. After all, no one would casually reveal their abilities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne, I'm sorry, we shouldn't have asked such childish questions."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alyssa quickly apologized sincerely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Other leaders also bowed and apologized.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smiled. In the face of absolute strength, some things needed no explanation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now what do you think of my plan? I will kill the leaders of those forces, causing them to fall into civil strife, and then the Axe Gang will take the opportunity to swallow them up!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alyssa pumped her fist excitedly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your plan is great. This time, we will unify Mandale Town."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone </span><span>present</span><span> no longer looked gloomy but waved their fists excited, with murder intention in their eyes.</span></p><div class="pagination">
