The international community will definitely not allow them to do whatever they want!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smiled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, this matter can only be dealt with by those top bosses, let's go home."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, the news that the Sakra Society had teamed up with the military to conduct human experiments and launch the Apocalypse Project in an attempt to dominate the world spread around the world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The five empires held a global emergency meeting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The president of the world's largest empire had been in office for four years and was about to run for re-election.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unexpectedly, such a crisis concerning global security occurred, and the president immediately ordered a thorough investigation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As long as he handled this matter well, he would continue to be the president.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The five empires issued the most severe warning in history, asking the governments of </span><span>Risun</span><span> to properly handle the crisis and severely punish those involved, otherwise, they would resort to war and wipe </span><span>Risun</span><span> off the map first.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In </span><span>Kylaville</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Prime Minister of </span><span>Risun</span><span> sighed deeply.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't expect this matter to be exposed. Whether it was using living people for human experiments or creating a biochemical crisis around the world, it was unacceptable to all mankind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Prime Minister picked up the phone, called Salman, and ordered in an extremely stern tone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Notify Yinson to destroy all immortality potions and materials.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I have warned you long ago that it must not be exposed, but Yinson has been too high-profile and is becoming increasingly out of control.

With this potion and the information, he could continue to promote the Apocalypse Project when the storm calmed down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But even Salman betrayed him, so he would not let anyone know this secret.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had to wait until the day when the storm was calm and the people who were monitoring him left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just wait! What the hell are the five empires? One day, I will let you know that I am the true ruler of the Earth!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He gritted his teeth and looked like a ghost.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Alexander returned to the Dragon Gang, Norma immediately came up to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She asked anxiously, "Mr. Hawthorne, have you found my sister Hazel?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander sighed softly and shook his head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I have confirmed that Hazel is not at Base One.
