Alexander hesitated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was already a Warrior, there was no need for him to take such a big risk.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Alexander was very worried that the Red Umbrella Group might have used the drug to cultivate a terrifying elite force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if he had enough ability to protect himself, what about his family, friends, and subordinates?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay, I'll buy one!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, Alexander made up his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he bought the potential potion and studied it carefully using Force Sense, he should be able to obtain some of the active ingredients in the potion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he could produce these active ingredients, he could train Augusta Dent and others and improve their strength without any side effects.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for one billion dollars, it was indeed a huge sum of money.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, magic powder had recently been promoted to various states by agents at all levels, and profits had increased exponentially, just reaching one billion dollars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander could buy the potion without using the money from the Saint Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But even people as rich as Alexander felt the pain of spending so much money.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He saved up one billion dollars with great difficulty but had to spend it all in one go.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it wasn't for the purpose of dealing with Guzman, Alexander wanted to sneak in and steal the potion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne, do you really want to buy it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lynne was so excited that she stuttered and could hardly believe what she heard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although she had been expecting Alexander to buy it, when the time came to complete the transaction, she became a little unconfident.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If this order was completed, she would get a commission of 200,000 dollars, which, together with her previous savings, would be enough for her to leave Treasure Island and start a new life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander had already started transferring the money.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the blink of an eye, one billion dollars disappeared from Alexander's account.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although he felt a pain in his heart, he was even more excited when he thought about the unexpected gains.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A robotic arm stretched out from the glass display case, grabbed a medicine, and handed it to Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lynne quickly explained, "Mr. Hawthorne, the bottle containing the medicine is not made of ordinary glass. Not to mention being thrown on the ground, it won't break even if it is run over by a car."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander nodded, resisting the urge to use the Force sense right away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because a pair of eyes were always staring at him and were now walking towards him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hello, Mr. Hawthorne!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A white-haired man walked out. He was probably in his early fifties. He had a good </span><span>temperament and exuded the majesty of a big shot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lynne saw the man and quickly bowed. "Hello, Mr. Milton!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Robert waved his hand and Lynne quickly stepped aside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne, I am Robert, the general manager of the trading center. I am very happy to meet you. I didn't expect that the Brilliant Group is full of talented people. You must have been very low-key."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Obviously, Robert had already checked Alexander's background information.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was not worried at all, because Augusta had already sent the real Edison to hell, so it was foolproof.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Milton, you are joking. I am just a small figure in the Brilliant Group. I just recently found my long-lost father. I didn't expect that he was from a royal family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, I got a lot of compensation..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander talked freely, telling the information that was fabricated by Augusta.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He even paid reporters to report the incident on local news, making it indistinguishable from the real thing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Robert looked at Alexander with a smile, looking cunning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had been observing Alexander's micro-expressions and didn't see any flaws.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Robert's voice suddenly became erratic, and everything around him started to become strange, making people feel as if they were in a ripple world, shaking everywhere, giving Alexander an extremely strong feeling of dizziness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only Robert's eyes became bright and sharp, like stars in the night sky.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was involuntarily attracted by the other person's eyes and voice, and then his head became dizzy as if his thinking had stagnated and rigidified.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lynne stood nearby and watched all this, and suddenly she became nervous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't expect that Robert would hypnotize her guests. Robert was a very powerful hypnotist and once hypnotized dozens of people at the same time in just a dozen seconds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Otherwise, if he was not that capable, he wouldn't be entrusted with such an important task.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lynne was very worried. Was there something wrong with Alexander's background?</span></p><div class="pagination">
