  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The young male police officer next to Melin, however, couldn't help but smile, feeling delighted to stand guard with Melin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though Melin had said she had a boyfriend last time, he still took his chances and hoped that he would get Melin's favor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melin suddenly couldn't help but laugh at the thought of Alexander. A bright smile of happiness and contentment spread across her exhausted face, and she felt energized.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She hoped that this terrible disaster would be over soon, so that she could meet Alexander again soon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though they had only been separated for a day, Melin missed Alexander so much that it was wet between her legs, and she was expectant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Ward, why don't you sit over there and take a break while I stand guard for you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The young male constable came over to curry favor with Melin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melin glanced at him with mixed feelings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though Melin had explained that she had a boyfriend, Jeff Beck clearly wasn't giving up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She waved her hand. "You don't have to help me. You should be careful and protective when you go round the wards later."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Ward, don't worry. We're so heavily protected, so it'll be fine!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeff patted the protective suit he was wearing, and he was still in a protective mask.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melin nodded. "Well, don't ever get infected."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeff whispered awkwardly, "Ms. Ward, if... I mean if you broke up with your boyfriend, would you consider me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melin couldn't help but laugh out loud.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't get any ideas. I'm fine with him, and we met yesterday. When plague passes, I'll introduce a girl to you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, you don't have to. I just like you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeff sighed deeply, looking frustrated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the two were chatting, they didn't notice that a man wearing a protective mask and a doctor's gown was staring wide-eyed around the corner of the corridor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dr. Bates, can I still be cured? eh-hem!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A patient asked as he approached.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blaze Bates impatiently pushed him away and snorted indifferently, "Don't come near me. Go back to your ward and get some rest. Hurry up, or I'll have security kick you out of the hospital."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blaze threatened him viciously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The patient was instantly terrified, and he rushed back to his ward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blaze peered sinisterly at Melin and Jeff.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Watching the two talk and laugh, Blaze felt as if he was stabbed in the heart or as if he was being torn apart by a vicious wolf, and the jealousy made it hard for him to control himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No wonder Melin rejected me. Jeff is his boyfriend. Damn it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It turned out that Blaze was also Melin's admirer, and he got the wrong idea about Jeff's identity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Melin wore protective clothing over her police uniform, her plump boobs remained uncovered. Her perfect body mesmerized Blaze completely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He even closed his eyes and fantasized about taking Melin in his arms and touching and kissing her. What a wonderful feeling that would be.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In particular, Melin's exceptionally pretty breasts and ass made Blaze absolutely bewitched.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Melin was the captain of the police force, so Blaze didn't dare to do anything but stare at her greedily and swallow like crazy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though Blaze was wearing a protective mask, it couldn't hide his hideous expression at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Jeff, you're screwed! Well, do you know who my cousin is? Just wait and see. I'll send you to my cousin."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blaze muttered ferociously, gritting his teeth and looking horrible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Melin suddenly smiled, and Jeff followed suit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blaze instantly became even more furious, his eyes widened as he gritted his teeth and cursed, "Asshole! Jeff, I'm going to make your life hell. Melin belongs to me, and she's mine!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wanted to rush over and punch Jeff hard in the face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he had to be patient, like he was a beast trying to hunt in the animal world, and he had to target, hunker down, and wait for his chance to strike first.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All Blaze had to do now was hide in the shadows and find his chance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melin and Jeff didn't even notice the peeper around the corner.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, Jeff left Melin and started patrolling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blaze was mentally surprised as he silently followed behind Jeff.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was a member of the Sakra Society from Risun who lurked in Loscity, and his cousin was the president, Yinson.</span></p><div class="pagination">
