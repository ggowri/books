  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander quickly said, "Oh, I couldn't possibly trouble you like that, Ms. Blackburn."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's no trouble at all. Thank you for bringing my daughter back. Besides, I'd love to take a walk, and spending time with Ava makes me happy."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lynn's words were so sincere that Ava's eyes filled with tears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Silly girl, why are you crying? I know I made mistakes back then. At that time, I was struggling to make ends meet...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I didn't think about how it affected you, and I should apologize."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lynn's eyes misted over as well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava hugged her tightly, and the two cried on each other's shoulders.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander watched, smiling softly, glad to see the mother and daughter finally making peace. It lifted a weight off his shoulders, too.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't help but think of his own mother, who had passed away, and the thought stung more than he expected.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lynn hugged Ava one last time, then smiled at Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My daughter's beautiful and kind, so don't you dare bully her, got it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander bowed his head slightly, smiling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry, Ms. Blackburn. I care about her too much to ever hurt her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lynn noted how respectful and grounded Alexander remained, and she nodded approvingly. Her daughter had chosen well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Lynn leading the way, the three of them headed into Astral Bistro's gemstone warehouse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alex, feel free to pick whatever you like. Consider it my gift to you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lynn spoke with confidence, as if generosity came naturally to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From a distance, Alexander's All-seeing Eyes had already picked up the glow of gemstones, and his spirits lifted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once the security guard opened the heavy iron door, they stepped inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The warehouse was massive, thousands of square meters, filled with rows of display cases showcasing an array of gemstones, emeralds, as well as gold and silver.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alex, our higher-quality gems are over on..." Lynn began.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But before she finished speaking, Alexander had already made his way to one of the central displays, closely examining the contents.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lynn was taken aback&mdash;Alexander hadn't even asked any questions and yet went straight for the best gems.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Was he a gem expert? It seemed unlikely&mdash;he was only in his twenties.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if he was, no expert could pinpoint the best display that easily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander caught the curiosity in Lynn's eyes and smiled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've always had a good eye for these things, especially gemstones."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Impressive! Alex, I wouldn't have guessed you knew so much about gems at your age."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lynn was getting more and more satisfied with her prospective son-in-law.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You flatter me, Ms. Blackburn. I just know a little bit."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The truth was, Alexander wasn't a gem expert, but his All-seeing Eyes made it easy to judge quality.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This one's top-grade red agate... This sapphire is impressive, easily worth a million dollars... This citrine, though, is a pity&mdash;too many impurities. It could've been a premium piece."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander murmured to himself as he inspected each gemstone, his commentary </span><span>revealing his skill.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lynn was surprised again&mdash;he didn't use any tools, nor did he check the tags, yet he spoke about each gem as he knew them intimately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, Alexander picked out a dozen high-quality gemstones, though none were quite top tier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>High-quality gems could still be useful&mdash;they could be crafted into protective charms or used for enhancing </span><span>Spellweave</span><span> Patterns.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite the size of Astral Bistro's warehouse, truly high-grade gems were in short supply.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, Alexander had browsed the entire inventory, finding nothing else noteworthy, and he shook his head in mild disappointment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lynn, eager to help, said, "If you're looking for top-tier gemstones, you should attend tomorrow's auction. There'll be some incredible pieces up for bid."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That sounds perfect&mdash;I'll definitely be there!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's eyes lit up, excited at the unexpected opportunity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alex, I'll take you to a friend of mine now. Besides here, he has the most extensive collection. He might have what you need."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lynn was enthusiastic, leading Alexander across the street to Dragonstone Gem Company.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Blackburn! What a surprise seeing you here in person. You could've just called, you know?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A middle-aged man in a tailored suit with a square jawline greeted them with a wide smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lynn returned his smile warmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Harris, this is Alexander, my daughter's boyfriend. He's looking for top-tier gemstones."</span></p><div class="pagination">
