  <div class="container"><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Come, everyone, let&#x27;s take a seat and enjoy the feast!&quot; Karson said.</p><p style="text-align:left;">After a few drinks, the previously serious mood lightened considerably, thanks to the alcohol.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Within hundreds of miles of the castle, a number of elite mercenaries were on duty, fully armed and alert to their surroundings.</p><p style="text-align:left;">The castle itself was equipped with hundreds of surveillance cameras, all active and on high alert. Even a bird wouldn&#x27;t slip past unnoticed.</p><p style="text-align:left;">The five of them gathered around, eating and chatting, while Alexander remained quiet, savoring his food.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Karson and Cesar discussed pressing news, particularly their interest in Sakra Society&#x27;s Immortality Serum.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Alexander sighed inwardly upon hearing this. If even these individuals were fixated on immortality, he could only imagine how much more the truly powerful and wealthy craved it.</p><p style="text-align:left;">This only solidified Alexander&#x27;s resolve to accelerate the development of Treasure Island and Devil Island, turning both into doomsday strongholds.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Before long, Yinson would bring catastrophe to the world.</p><p style="text-align:left;">The camaraderie among Karson, Cesar, Dariel, and Travis grew, showing no signs that they were preparing for an imminent threat.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Alexander, however, remained relaxed, not taking Stephen seriously at all.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Karson, Cesar, and the others stayed vigilant, their senses heightened as they discussed and drank, always aware of their surroundings, like springs coiled tight, ready to spring into action at a moment&#x27;s notice.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Suddenly, a faint howl echoed outside.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Karson immediately stood up, his expression turning grave as he peered outside.</p><p style="text-align:left;">A guard rushed in panic etched across his blood-soaked face. &quot;Mr. Chapman, bad news!&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">He barely got the words out before collapsing to the ground and passing out.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Everyone caught a whiff of the strong blood odor wafting from behind him.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Who did this?&quot; Cesar shouted angrily, turning toward the door.</p><p style="text-align:left;">In unison, they all turned to see a dark figure materialize silently in the entryway.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Karson&#x27;s voice turned icy. &quot;Stephen!&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Stephen came, clad in a black robe, two sabers sheathed in his belt. Though the sabers were not drawn, they radiated a deadly aura.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Mr. Chapman, you were bold enough to make me make this trip.&quot; Stephen looked at Karson with a smile, then glanced at Cesar and the others.</p><p style="text-align:left;">With a sneer, he taunted Karson. &quot;Are these the so-called allies you&#x27;ve gathered? What a shame. All those guards outside are dead.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Karson&#x27;s face paled. He had deployed dozens of mercenaries to secure the perimeter, never anticipating they&#x27;d all be wiped out so easily by Stephen.</p><p style="text-align:left;">It was only when Stephen made his entrance that Karson realized just how much stronger Stephen was than he had imagined.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Cesar, Dariel, and Travis immediately stood, glaring at Stephen.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Their powerful energies coalesced, aimed directly at him.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Only Alexander remained unperturbed, continuing to enjoy his meal.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Using his Force Sense, he had gauged Stephen&#x27;s true strength, which was on par with Felix&#x27;s.</p><p style="text-align:left;">But unfortunately, it was nothing in Alexander&#x27;s eyes.</p><p style="text-align:left;">In the past, Alexander had been an Intermediate Warrior and managed to defeat Felix; now, as an Advanced Warrior, the situation was even more in his favor.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Yet, even if Cesar, Dariel, and Travis combined their strengths, they would still find themselves outmatched by Stephen. Without Alexander&#x27;s intervention, they would definitely be killed.</p><p style="text-align:left;">If Alexander decided to take Stephen down without using his Lightsabers, they might have to trade blows for some time.</p><p style="text-align:left;">But if Alexander unleashed his full power, Stephen wouldn&#x27;t stand a chance.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Mr. Chapman, surrender control of Sunrise Group to Sakra Society and join us. I might still spare your life,&quot; Stephen said arrogantly.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Karson&#x27;s anger flared. &quot;Forget Sakra Society! You&#x27;re all just a bunch of losers. If you want my company, come and take it!&quot; he yelled.</p><p style="text-align:left;">With the backing of three experts, Karson felt confident in victory.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Are you serious? This is a world, where strength reigns supreme. You think these so-called allies of yours are worth anything?&quot; Stephen retorted, pointing derisively at Cesar, Dariel, and Travis.</p><div class="pagination">
