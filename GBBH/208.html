I really can't take this case; it's bound to lose. I advise you to withdraw before Alexander countersues."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane's face filled with despair and unwillingness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rowan bowed his head apologetically to Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne, I'm really sorry; I'm not taking Jane's case anymore. My apologies for the disturbance."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he hurried off without looking back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Jane, I give you twenty-four hours. If you don't withdraw, I'll represent the other party in countersuing you for defamation. I hope you won't dig your own grave!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Madelyn tossed the drafted lawsuit in front of her and turned to Alexander with a gentle smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you satisfied with what I did?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander nodded, too lazy to acknowledge Jane.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The group chatted and laughed as they left, leaving Jane standing there, dazed, her pale face filled with frustration and anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, this isn't over! I didn't do anything wrong; I won't let you have it better than me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane cursed like a madwoman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, there's a new restaurant that just opened. How about I treat you to lunch?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Madelyn blushed as she took the initiative to invite him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander couldn't help but size her up&mdash;youthful and stunning, alluring and charming.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do I look good? I suppose so."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Noticing Alexander's gaze, Madelyn didn't shy away; instead, she proudly puffed out her chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander felt his face flush, unsure where to look.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Madelyn was indeed attractive; even ordinary celebrities would seem dull beside her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No thanks, my girlfriend is waiting for me. There are some things I need to discuss with her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander subtly indicated he had a girlfriend before leaving stylishly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Alexander walked away, Madelyn's smile froze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He has a girlfriend?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Of course, what woman wouldn't like such a young, wealthy man?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought, "Hmph! So what? Just a girlfriend, not a wife. It's a fair competition; I still have a chance."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead of backing down, Madelyn found herself even more interested in Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She secretly resolved to be more proactive with him; she couldn't let such a good man slip away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Alexander got home, Ava had already left for work at the Saint Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Lara rushed in, panting, carrying a bunch of big bags that were either Hermes or Prada&mdash;high-end brands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Alexander was about to ask what she was doing </span><span>there,</span><span> Lara playfully rolled her eyes at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Help me carry these! I got some things for Ava and you, so please help me out."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lara stuffed everything into Alexander's arms and then collapsed onto the sofa, exhaling deeply.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ugh, I'm exhausted! These are all new styles, and it's hard to get them unless you're a senior member."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You really fell into a lucky spot, having such a great girlfriend like Ava and me caring about you so much..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Lara grumbled, she slipped off her high heels and started massaging her feet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't mind at all that her beautiful, smooth legs were exposed beneath her short skirt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander could even see a hint of pink at the top of her thighs; she was wearing pink </span><span>panties.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't help but feel a stir in his heart, recalling their wild moments together.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"These new shoes are so uncomfortable; they've bruised my feet!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lara complained, frowning, and tossed her still-warm heels in front of Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A faint, unique scent that only a woman has wafted toward him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For a moment, Alexander's mind was filled with thoughts of those beautiful legs and her heaving, curvy chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You'd better remember your promise to help me become the head of the Hansen family, or I won't let you off!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Look what I got you, </span><span>heehee</span><span>..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lara squatted down in front of the pile of shopping bags and started rummaging through them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From Alexander's angle, Lara's figure was especially tempting as she squatted in front of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her tiny waist had no excess flesh, and the graceful curve led down to her round, perky backside, with no panty lines indicating she was wearing a thong...</span></p><div class="pagination">
