If you have any issue, come at me, and don't bully the others," Frank shouted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Frank angrily pointed at Rosen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you think you're getting some respect? Shut up!" Rosen roared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosen slapped Frank again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Frank, already in his seventies and in poor health, couldn't endure such a beating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He immediately fell to the ground, blood streaming from his nose and mouth, his breath growing faint.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The other members of the Fairfax family were pale with fear, watching helplessly as Frank was beaten, too terrified to even help him up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, the entire Fairfax family was forced into cars, while Rosen recorded a video on his phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Heh, I'll send this pitiful footage to Alexander. If he has any humanity left, he won't ignore you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Early the next morning, Alexander received the video along with a threat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, you have one week to hand over the magic powder formula, or your former family will die for your sake!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing the Fairfax family's miserable state in the video, Alexander felt a surge of satisfaction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In his five years with the Fairfax family, except for Frank, the others always treated him harshly, bullying him as they pleased.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, seeing these people being bullied now, Alexander felt nothing but delight, without a trace of sorrow or worry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Alexander saw Frank lying still, bleeding from his nose and mouth, he was furious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was livid!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Frank was the only person in the family who treated Alexander well, someone he remembered fondly and had called "Grandpa" for five years.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Frank beaten like this was something Alexander could not tolerate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The rest of the Fairfax family could be bullied by Schroder, as it was poetic justice, but they should not have touched Frank.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This kind old man was not someone they were allowed to harm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander suddenly got up, startling Ava who was sleeping beside him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A naked, alluring body wrapped around him, lying on his chest, breathing softly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, why are you up so early? Did something happen?" Ava asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feeling Ava's smooth and full body against him, Alexander's anger subsided a bit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He pulled Ava into his arms, kissing and touching her, enjoying the moment before showing her the video.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Schroder is too much, using such a low and vicious method as kidnapping to threaten you. And he's a lieutenant general, how shameless!" Ava fumed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smiled lightly. "I can ignore the others in the Fairfax family, but I have to take care of Sir Fairfax. I'm going out; you should also stay safe."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, go do what you need to. I'll stay safe," Ava nodded sensibly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, the </span><span>Loscity</span><span> Police Department also learned of the Fairfax family's disappearance and obtained firsthand information.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With over thirty people in the Fairfax family, it was hard to miss; Rosen's convoy of a dozen cars, filled with people parading through town, had already caught the attention of those on high alert.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Oliver watched the surveillance footage in his office, frowning repeatedly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Schroder's men were truly audacious, but he knew better than to cross a high-ranking major general.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bang!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, the office door burst open, and Melin stormed in, furious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's going on?"</span></p><div class="pagination">
