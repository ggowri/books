  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, Alyosha felt a sharp pain in his chest. He looked down to see a black, straw-like object piercing his body.</span><span> </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Say goodbye, Alyosha. You'll meet Adara soon enough," Guzman sneered, pulling the cane out with force.</span><span> </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alyosha collapsed to the ground, his body convulsing uncontrollably. Blood gushed from the wound, only to be absorbed instantly by the Ancestral Witch's Cane. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Streams of pure life energy flowed into Guzman, invigorating him. In moments, the once-strong Alyosha was reduced to a withered husk.</span><span> </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Guzman breathed heavily, not from fear, but from exhilaration. Having absorbed the life energy of two demons, he felt invincible.</span><span> </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even if more of them come, the Ancestral Witch's Cane will make quick work of them," he thought, no longer the timid man he once was. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He continued his grim task, eliminating those who had wronged him. The cave soon held several more shriveled corpses, destined to vanish without a trace.</span><span> </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Bryant, is it time for the sacrifice ceremony?" someone interrupted Guzman's thoughts.</span><span> </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He rubbed his temples, looking at Cloe with a conflicted expression.</span><span> </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Returning safely, Guzman had been rewarded by the Godfather, becoming president of the Brilliant Group. But those women had cost him dearly, leaving him unable to father children. He blamed his father for it all, the trauma a constant nightmare.</span><span> </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Cloe, it's an honor for you to sacrifice your life for your family and the Brilliant Group," he said, looking at his adopted daughter.</span><span> </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cloe glared back, defiant. Blood flowed from her wrist, absorbed by the Ancestral Witch's Cane. The room was tense, filled with a terrifying atmosphere.</span><span> </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Guzman lifted the Ancestral Witch's Cane, and everyone bowed their heads. Alexander, hidden above, watched the cane, sensing its dark power. The cane was covered in tiny engravings and images of evil creatures.</span><span> </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Guzman drew symbols in the air, chanting softly.</span><span> </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My ancient ancestors, I offer these sacrifices to awaken your great will..."</span><span> </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The lights flickered as if something was about to appear. Everyone except Guzman knelt, trembling in fear and awe.</span><span> </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I will inherit the witch clan's bloodline and walk the path of supreme witchcraft!</span><span> </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>May the world bask in the Witch God's glory! With Cloe's blood as my guide, grant me the power of witchcraft..."</span><span> </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Guzman's eyes shone with madness, excitement mounting. Suddenly, a dark force surged from the cane, rejuvenating him. His hair darkened, wrinkles vanished, and he appeared ten years younger.</span><span> </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The great Witch God!" Guzman exclaimed, kneeling.</span><span> </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Bryant family was ecstatic, becoming fervent believers of the Witch God. They followed Guzman, kneeling to pray. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they prayed, Alexander saw his chance to act. But just then, a man in a suit stood up from the crowd.</span></p><div class="pagination">
