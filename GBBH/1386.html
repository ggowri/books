Rhodes carefully lifted the lid, and at once, a rich fragrance filled the room. A brilliant crimson light shot out, revealing the faint outline of a golden serpent-dragon, coiling and soaring within the glow, accompanied by the faint sound of a dragon's roar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inside the box lay a single crimson pill&mdash;the legendary martial arts elixir,&nbsp;Golden Serpent Pill!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If a&nbsp;level-four warrior&nbsp;at their peak consumed this pill, it would greatly enhance their chances of condensing their&nbsp;Force&nbsp;into a core, significantly increasing their odds of advancing to a&nbsp;level-five warrior.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jaryl, an&nbsp;inner disciple&nbsp;ranked 46th on the&nbsp;martial virtue leaderboard, had sent someone to deliver this pill&mdash;on one condition: Alexander had to die in the upcoming grand tournament.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rhodes let out a bitter chuckle. He was already on the verge of reaching&nbsp;level-five warrior. The sting of his previous tournament defeat had pushed him to shatter his mental barriers, ensuring his inevitable breakthrough. Now, with Madden's&nbsp;Thunderstrike Manual, it would be nearly impossible for him&nbsp;notto reach level five.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't need the&nbsp;Golden Serpent Pill&nbsp;for now, but there was no denying its value. He had seen one before in the&nbsp;Treasure House, priced at&nbsp;five million silver coins&nbsp;or&nbsp;one million martial virtue points.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That Alexander sure was a troublemaker!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But I like that. The humiliation still burned in my heart. Alexander must&nbsp;die.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rhodes' expression shifted unpredictably as he picked up the&nbsp;Thunderstrike Manual and began flipping through it...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, in the&nbsp;Marshal's Mansion, an old steward bowed and stepped away. Madden sat calmly in a grand armchair, his face expressionless as he muttered to himself, "Rhodes... Alexander..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the&nbsp;Dominion Church's Inner Court, Jaryl asked sharply, "Did he take it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A middle-aged servant bowed and answered, "Rhodes accepted it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Three days later, Alexander handed&nbsp;Logan&nbsp;a banknote worth&nbsp;one hundred thousand silver coins. Combined with the&nbsp;one hundred thousand&nbsp;they had won from the last tournament, they now had&nbsp;two hundred thousand silver coins&mdash;the startup capital for&nbsp;Serene Medical.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Logan, holding the banknote tightly, excitedly set off for the&nbsp;Hall of Lives, bringing&nbsp;Nova&nbsp;and a few estate workers along.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Liora&nbsp;had once mentioned that the sacred land of the&nbsp;Hall of Lives&nbsp;had a special blessing&mdash;herbs sprouted faster and grew with exceptional quality. In fact, most of the herbal seedlings supplied to all of&nbsp;Darwin&nbsp;came from there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Logan left, Alexander sat in deep thought. October was approaching fast.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In just a few months, the&nbsp;New Year's Grand Tournament&nbsp;would take place.&nbsp;The Whetherall family&nbsp;and Rhodes would surely come after him, and now&nbsp;Jaryl&nbsp;had joined the mix. Alexander had to push himself harder, break past his limits&mdash;only then could he survive. He was just about to plan to spar with&nbsp;Vegeta.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dong! Dong! Dong!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander leaped to his feet, his face instantly changing. The&nbsp;Great Brahma Bell&nbsp;of&nbsp;Dominion Church&nbsp;had tolled&mdash;something&nbsp;big&nbsp;had happened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without hesitation, Alexander activated his&nbsp;Force, his feet propelling him forward like a soaring bird as he raced toward the&nbsp;relay station.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fifteen minutes later, Alexander returned to the&nbsp;Outer Court, heading straight for the&nbsp;training grounds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The&nbsp;training grounds&nbsp;were packed with&nbsp;Outer Court&nbsp;disciples. The atmosphere buzzed with excitement&mdash;whenever the&nbsp;Great Brahma Bell&nbsp;rang, it meant something monumental had occurred.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a short wait, Declan and&nbsp;Huxley, accompanied by several young disciples, stepped onto the&nbsp;assessment platform. The crowd immediately fell silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Declan shook his&nbsp;bible, his expression grave. His voice boomed like thunder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ever since&nbsp;Xhantao&nbsp;surrendered after the first failed invasion by the&nbsp;Oceanic Coalition, it has been a vassal state of the&nbsp;Hrodvik Empire&nbsp;for thirty years&mdash;paying tribute every year and sending envoys annually.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We have just received an urgent report from the imperial court. Today, an envoy from&nbsp;Xhantao&nbsp;arrived in&nbsp;Darwin, pleading for assistance. The&nbsp;Risun Empire&nbsp;has mobilized an army of one million troops in a sudden assault, advancing at a rate of&nbsp;one hundred miles per day. They are now less than&nbsp;five thousand miles&nbsp;from&nbsp;Hamish, the capital of&nbsp;Xhantao. The&nbsp;Risunese&nbsp;are ruthless and insatiable. If they successfully conquer&nbsp;Xhantao, their power will grow exponentially. From then on, our&nbsp;Hrodvik Empire&nbsp;will never know peace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Each of you will soon receive a&nbsp;summons from the imperial court. Of course, the battlefield is a place where death is nearly certain! As&nbsp;Outer Court disciples&nbsp;of&nbsp;Dominion Church, you have the right to refuse&mdash;or to step forward and enlist."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Declan spoke, his eyes flashed with a deep, knowing light. Alexander felt as if the master was looking directly at him&mdash;just like back during the&nbsp;Outer Court selection, when Declan had secretly hoped he wouldn't rush into battle before reaching&nbsp;level-five warrior.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Huxley&nbsp;stepped forward, taking over the announcement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"For those who choose to enlist, all costs in the&nbsp;Manual House, Treasure House, Beast Lodge,&nbsp;and&nbsp;Gracehaven Hall&mdash;including silver and&nbsp;martial virtue points&mdash;will be&nbsp;halved. Additionally, three days from now, the&nbsp;Shaha Trade Fair&nbsp;will be held at the&nbsp;training grounds, jointly hosted by the&nbsp;imperial court&nbsp;and&nbsp;Dominion Church. All enlisting disciples are eligible to participate!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, the two masters turned and left for the&nbsp;meditation hall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Some in the crowd fell into deep thought, while others turned and left without looking back. Small groups of three or five huddled together, whispering among themselves, while a few spoke with passionate intensity...</span></p><div class="pagination">
