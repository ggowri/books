  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Alexander wasn't about to cut them any slack. He knocked each of them down with a swift smack, sending all three&mdash;including Gael&mdash;sprawling across the floor. The sound of the hits echoed through the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone froze, their jaws practically hitting the floor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Brittany couldn't believe what she was seeing. Sure, she had faith in Alexander's abilities, but taking on three powered-up metahumans was something else.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The rest of the team stared at Alexander in shock, their jaws practically on the floor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmph." Alexander shot the three of them a cold look but held back from any further attacks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, Quentin had brought him here for a reason. These guys were part of the tactical team, and losing any of them would mean one less fighter against the Sakra Society.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A quick beating would teach them a lesson. They needed to tone it down and stop </span><span>acting so cocky.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As more power elixirs were developed, the number of metahumans kept growing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Some of these enhanced individuals started getting really full of themselves, thinking they were chosen ones or something. Just because they had powers way beyond normal humans, they acted like they were meant to rule the world, and regular people should bow down to them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was exactly why Alexander had roughed up Gael and his friends today&mdash;to knock some sense into them before their heads got too big.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What the hell is going on here? Who said you could fight at this place?" Quentin's worried voice cut through the air. He'd rushed over the moment he got word of the incident.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Attention!" The whole team snapped to attention and saluted as soon as they spotted Quentin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"General Thompson, thank God you're here! This guy is completely out of control. He just started beating us up out of nowhere!" one of the metahumans complained angrily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Out of control, huh?" Quentin let out a cold laugh. He walked a slow circle around Gael and his two buddies, his voice dripping with ice. "So let me get this straight. I heard Gael was sparring with Alexander. But what really happened was you three ganged up on him, three against one, and you still lost, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The three of them kept their heads down, not daring to make a sound.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bunch of useless idiots. You're so full of yourself!" Quentin growled, his face dark with anger. "Complete morons."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Of course, he'd take Alexander's side. This mission wasn't even about the squad team&mdash;Alexander was their real trump card here. Only someone with his kind of power could tip the scales in their favor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quentin actually thought it was great that Alexander had put Gael in his place. There was nothing like a good beating to keep everyone in line.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After getting chewed out, Gael and his buddies just stood there like statues, their faces swollen, totally shell-shocked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, you're running tonight's raid," Quentin announced. "From now on, your word is my word. If anyone gives you trouble, deal with them however you want."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander just gave a slight smile, not arguing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come on, let me show you around inside," Quentin said, changing the subject and leading Alexander deeper into the building.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander threw one last smirk at Gael's group before following.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brittany and the others stuck to Alexander like glue, completely ignoring Gael's crew as they walked past.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon enough, only Gael and his two buddies were left standing there looking like total idiots, probably wishing they could disappear into thin air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The training facility was massive, split into different sections based on skill level. It had everything from regular workout spaces for normal folks to specialized zones for metahumans. The most impressive area could handle level-three metahumans practicing their strength and speed training.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the group walked deeper into the building, they heard gunshots echoing through the halls.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sound-proofing was top-notch though. The shots came through as muffled thumps rather than sharp cracks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The shooting range stretched out for about </span><span>200 meters</span><span>, lit up like a football field under massive floodlights.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The setup was pretty sweet. They had over a dozen shooting stations, each with its own target lane.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The lounge area next door was decked out with all the amenities they could want. Free snacks and drinks were up for grabs, and they even had massage chairs for when people needed to take a breather between sessions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A few people were already at their stations getting some practice in, while others kicked back in the lounge. The moment Quentin walked in, everyone jumped to their feet and snapped to attention.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, stop right there!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A sharp voice cut through the air from behind them, making Quentin's face darken instantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone whipped around to see what was going down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A group of about fifteen people came storming up. Gael and his two sidekicks were trailing behind, but what really caught everyone's eye was the woman leading the charge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was probably in her mid-twenties, tall and commanding in a black trench coat instead of the usual camo gear. Her knee-high leather boots clicked against the floor with each step, somehow making even that sound intimidating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was a total knockout, but it wasn't just her looks. She carried herself like she was royalty or something, and everyone could feel it.</span><span> </span></p><div class="pagination">
