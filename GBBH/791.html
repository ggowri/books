  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Brandon stared at Yinson warily and asked, "What do you want to do?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yinson smiled, "Don't be nervous. We are allies, and we will never harm you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I have good news for you. I have arranged for Jake to lead a few living dead to Loscity. Jake has already established a base deep in the Bonifa Mountains. In less than a month, he will kill Alexander and destroy the Ultimate Alliance!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Brandon didn't believe it and asked doubtfully, "Alexander is powerful. The Ultimate Alliance has thousands of people in Loscity. Can a few living dead kill him? Can they destroy the Ultimate Alliance?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before Yinson answered, Elaine snorted contemptuously and said unhappily, "Mr. Hawkins, you don't know how powerful the living dead are. Each living dead can create an endless army of zombies. They are fearless and brave. They can kill any strong man with their numerical advantage."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Zombies?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Brandon jumped up from his seat in shock and asked stutteringly, "Do you mean the zombies from the movie?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Elaine answered proudly and affirmatively, "Yes! Don't worry. We can command the zombie army by controlling the living dead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What else in this world can stop us? Alexander is just an ant on the ground. He can be killed by us easily."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Brandon's face turned pale, and he was terrified.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He suddenly felt that he should not ally with these lunatics. These lunatics would either destroy the entire human race or be killed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yinson laughed and put his arm around Brandon's shoulders affectionately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He said, "Don't worry. We are not only allies but also good friends. The future world will be controlled by us together.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"In a month at most, Alexander will be dead, and the Ultimate Alliance will disappear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"In half a year at most, we will all become immortal and rule the entire world!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Salman smiled, "We Risunese like to make friends, such as Mr. Hawkins! Come on. Let's have a drink for our bright future."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Elaine quickly took out some red wine and poured a glass for each of them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They clinked their glasses and drank it all in one gulp.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Brandon hadn't recovered yet, and his expression still looked a little ugly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He wanted to kill Alexander and annex everything in the Ultimate Alliance, but he didn't expect to be dragged into a big conspiracy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But if he could be immortal and rule the whole world... Brandon couldn't control his excitement anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yinson pulled Brandon and walked outside, saying, "Come on. Let's go have a drink. Elaine, accompany General Bowen to study the Apocalypse Project."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Just as the door of the conference room was closed, Elaine couldn't wait to throw herself into Salman's arms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Salman was already filled with desire. He kissed Elaine fiercely, bit her sexy red lips, and sucked them hard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At the same time, he grabbed her plump and soft breasts, rubbing them hard, squeezing them, and making them into various shapes in his palms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"General Bowen, don't be so impatient."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Elaine skillfully unbuckled Salman's belt and zipper, and then she grabbed the medium-sized penis with her soft hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Salman became excited and pushed Elaine's head down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Elaine immediately understood and obediently knelt between Salman's legs, burying her head deeply in them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Salman hummed comfortably.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He felt wrapped in warmth and moisture. A slippery tongue swirled around the tip, and the penis immediately swelled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Salman breathed in cool air through between his teeth because Elaine used the tip of her tongue to tap and bite it gently with her teeth. It felt good but also a little painful. It was really a mixture of pain and happiness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Baby, use them."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Salman smiled and pinched Elaine's breasts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Elaine smiled sweetly and used her fingers to undo the bra that was already stretched to its limit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She held her breasts, which were too big to be grasped in one hand, and began to rub them. Then, she lowered her head down and kissed them twice before she clamped Salman's dick and began to push up and down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Is that so?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Yes, that's it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Salman nodded repeatedly, leaning back in his chair, enjoying the beautiful doctor's service.</span></p><div class="pagination">
