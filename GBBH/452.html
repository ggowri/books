  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dozens of bodies lay scattered across the corridor, their twisted forms telling of the violence that had just transpired.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The once pristine floor was now a crimson canvas, painted with the blood of the fallen and littered with bloody footprints, the air thick with the pungent smell of blood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The remaining individuals dared not obstruct Alexander any longer, their faces etched with terror as they retreated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a cold expression, Alexander sheathed his Lightsaber, the blade remarkably free of any bloodstains.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Having gleaned no useful information, Alexander strode out of the Pegasus Club with a heavy gait.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava, growing impatient and anxious, inquired, "Are you alright? Did you find Ashley?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander gestured sharply. "Search the place!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alice immediately led a hundred individuals into the Pegasus Club, scouring every nook and cranny, but to no avail.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's disappointment was palpable. He suppressed the rage simmering within and departed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The massive convoy headed towards the Red Umbrella Group's headquarters, disappearing into the night.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the meantime, the news of Kyle's demise reached Felix with haste.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What? Kyle is dead? Impossible! He was a level-one metahuman with pyrokinetic abilities. How could he be killed by Alexander?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix rose from his seat in a fit of rage, slamming his hand on the table.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Vanderbilt, Alexander is leading dozens of vehicles towards us, estimated to be two to three hundred people. What do we do now?" his subordinate urgently reported.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix gritted his teeth and asked, "How many men can we gather right now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We don't have enough men in </span><span>Loscity</span><span>. At most, we can gather about a hundred, and many have never seen combat."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The subordinate glanced at Felix fearfully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A bunch of trash!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix slapped him, sending him reeling from the impact.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get Raven involved immediately. I want Alexander dead at any cost!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, sir, right away!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The subordinate, clutching his stinging cheek, hurried off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's convoy arrived at the heavily fortified estate that served as the Red </span><span>Umbrella Group's headquarters.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was late at night. The faint moonlight cast long shadows, and an eerie silence enveloped the area, broken only by the glow of a few street lamps.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Using his All-seeing Eyes, Alexander scanned the surroundings. Dozens of eyes were watching within a radius of three hundred feet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Some belonged to the Red Umbrella Group's hidden sentries, but many more were bounty hunters eager to claim the half-a-billion bounty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava's hefty reward had proven effective. Although Ashley had not been found, the manor was effectively under siege.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What do we do now? Should we storm in together?" Ava asked, her concern for Alexander's safety evident.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander, however, stared coldly into a shadowy corner and bellowed, "Come out. There's no use hiding. I've already seen you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You actually spotted me? It seems you do have some real skills."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A raspy male voice echoed, and a lean middle-aged man emerged from the shadows.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander appraised him. The man had brown hair and pale skin, wore a black garment, and carried a slender rapier at his waist, his feet bare against the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His piercing blue eyes radiated a chilling coldness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander asked coldly, "Are you with the Red Umbrella Group?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man's eyes narrowed as he scrutinized Alexander before chuckling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I am Raven Morris, Deputy Head of Security for the Red Umbrella Group."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander waved his hand impatiently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Cut the chatter. Hand over my daughter immediately, or I'll slaughter all of you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Raven sneered, his eyes narrowing with murderous intent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He glanced at Alexander and said, "Alexander, don't think that defeating Kyle makes you invincible. If you want to charge in, you'll have to ask my sword first."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He gripped the hilt with his right hand and slowly drew out the long sword.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was an extremely slender rapier, its sharp tip gleaming with an intimidating silver light, giving the impression that it could pierce through steel plates.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosalia warned quickly, "Master, be careful. He is a </span><span>swordmaster</span><span>!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Swordmaster</span><span>?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's gaze turned more serious.</span></p><div class="pagination">
