  <div class="container"><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;You&#x27;re such a little flirt!&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Stephen gave Brianna&#x27;s bare backside a sharp smack, causing her to gasp and her hips to sway with the impact.</p><p style="text-align:left;">She was already wet, catching the light in a way that made it gleam with an almost seductive shimmer.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Ah!&quot; Brianna felt as though her body were being ripped apart.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Stephen was unbearably rough, acting as though he had no idea how to treat a woman, leaving her helpless and crying out in distress.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Half an hour later, the place was spotless.</p><p style="text-align:left;">The faint scent of blood still hung in the air, but the floor was clean, with no sign of the mess that had been there before.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Bitch, you&#x27;re squeezing so tight!&quot; Stephen cursed, his grip tightening on her soft curves, making Brianna scream in pain.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Brianna collapsed weakly to the floor, her body covered in red marks and dark bruises, clear signs of the brutal treatment Stephen had just subjected her to.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Stephen, feeling satisfied, pulled up his pants and casually waved at Joaquin.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Take this filthy woman to the backyard and lock her up. I&#x27;m not done with her yet. Once I&#x27;ve had my fun, we&#x27;ll deal with her.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Yes, Sir.&quot; Joaquin quickly signaled for his men to drag Brianna away.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Today, he&#x27;d learned just how brutal Stephen could be. He killed by decapitation and showed no mercy to women, treating them with the same cruel disregard.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Sir, please, this way,&quot; Joaquin said, leading Stephen to the center of the room.</p><p style="text-align:left;">The others stood around them in silence, maintaining a respectful distance as if they were orbiting Stephen at the center.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Has Tyler delivered the latest intel on Ultimate Alliance, specifically about Alexander&#x27;s recent activities?&quot; Stephen asked coldly, his tone sharp.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Joaquin quickly answered, &quot;No... Tyler didn&#x27;t hand over any information to me.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;No? No wonder his entire team was wiped out. What a fool!&quot; Stephen spat, his eyes flashing with menace.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;He underestimated Ultimate Alliance and Alexander. That&#x27;s why he failed. You all are a useless bunch. What good are you to me?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Y-Yes, Sir, you&#x27;re right. But we did our best. Our other teams mostly completed their tasks.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">The group of men, including Joaquin, scrambled to explain themselves, their faces pale with fear, knowing Stephen&#x27;s temper was not to be trifled with.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Hmph! You may have had some success, but all you do is pick the easy targets. Taking down Ultimate Alliance and Alexander, that&#x27;s what matters most in this mission!&quot; Stephen slammed his hand down hard on the table.</p><p style="text-align:left;">The impact left a deep imprint in the solid wood, a clear sign of his anger.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Joaquin quickly suggested, &quot;Sir, with your strength, you could easily handle Alexander. Why don&#x27;t we gather our men and go into Loscity?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Stephen immediately rejected the idea. &quot;No! Alexander isn&#x27;t just some weakling. He must have gained some powerful inheritance or treasure. That&#x27;s why he&#x27;s so strong.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;We can&#x27;t afford to underestimate him. I need to strengthen myself one more time to make sure I have a hundred percent certainty!&quot; he said and gritted his teeth, his eyes burning with a deadly focus.</p><p style="text-align:left;">After all, when Sakra Society and Mafia teamed up with Felix, Alexander still managed to kill him and severely hurt Mafia.</p><p style="text-align:left;">When Stephen arrived, Yinson had promised him that if he killed Alexander and took control of Ultimate Alliance, he would not only receive a reward worth hundreds of billions of dollars but also become the vice president of Sakra Society, with the promise of eternal life.</p><p style="text-align:left;">The temptation was irresistible. After all, many powerful figures coveted immortality.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Once he became vice president, he would be second only to Yinson himself in a position of supreme authority.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Stephen&#x27;s heart burned with ambition. Yinson was getting old, and Sakra Society needed someone like him, a younger generation, to lead it into a new era.</p><p style="text-align:left;">If he could uncover Alexander&#x27;s secret, he&#x27;d have the power to eliminate Yinson.</p><p style="text-align:left;">The thought of his promising future ignited a fire within Stephen&#x27;s heart.</p><p style="text-align:left;">He struggled to calm himself and, in a steady voice, asked, &quot;Besides Alexander, who are the other key targets we still need to deal with?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Joaquin quickly replied, &quot;There&#x27;s also Karson Chapman, the chairman of Sunrise Group. Brock is just a small-time leader under him.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Sunrise Group controls the port, and that&#x27;s a cash cow for us.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;The supplies Ultimate Alliance sends to Treasure Island all pass through Louvian Port. If we take Karson down and seize control of the port, it would be a massive blow to Ultimate Alliance!&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">The others in the room shuddered at the thought, too afraid to speak further.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Karson was a three-time undefeated champion of the free combat league. Taking him down wouldn&#x27;t be so easy.</p><div class="pagination">
