  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The plump woman was surprised.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Wow! Really? The beauty ointments are expensive, and they have been out of stock recently. People can't buy it even if they have money. Tell me the truth, have you found a man to support you? Otherwise, where did you get so much money?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Slim woman embarrassed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"No, I just met a nice uncle in a bar. He thought I was beautiful and worthy of expensive things."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"An uncle you met at the bar? How much older is he than you? Have you ever slept with him? Did he behave well in sex? Can he make you climax?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The conversation between the two women was exciting, and Alexander heard it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander shook his head and thought these two women were coquettish.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If you don't accompany that man tonight, then come to my place. I miss you, let's have fun tonight..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You still want to play? That thing you bought the day before yesterday almost killed me... We can have fun, but you can't do it like before."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The slender woman complained in a low voice and pouted angrily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Okay, I'll be gentle tonight..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When Alexander heard what the two women said, he shook his head. He couldn't believe that they liked both men and women.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When passing by the two women, Alexander glanced at them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He saw the two of them snuggling together; their expressions were coquettish and excited, which was indescribable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After Alexander walked away, he could still hear their gentle laughter and their conversation about things like threesomes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander was not surprised. After all, society was open. As long as one did not affect others or violate the law, no one would care whether he liked men or women.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the blink of an eye, Alexander had walked around the huge shopping mall but did not find any ideal gift.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Just when Alexander was feeling disappointed, he suddenly smelled a pleasant scent of perfume.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He was excited involuntarily. This perfume shop was a little different from the others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This was a recently popular brand on the Internet. Its price and sales volume were not as good as those of luxury brands, but it was very popular.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander could smell a variety of faint scents; some were very fresh, some were sexy and wild, and some were like the scent of a woman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He walked quickly into the store, looked at the dazzling array of perfumes, and started to select carefully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The display racks and counters were filled with all kinds of perfume bottles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Under the light, these uniquely shaped perfume bottles seemed to be made of crystal and diamonds, reflecting beautiful light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this time, two saleswomen hurried over. After all, it was not common to see a young and handsome man like Alexander dressed in famous brands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander's clothes, watch, and other items were worth at least over one hundred thousand dollars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The two women smiled warmly at Alexander, with envy in their hearts. The perfume here was experienced. They wondered which woman he was giving the perfume as a gift.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Sir, which one do you like?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The two women came close to Alexander without hesitation, and he smelled a charming body fragrance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander moved away from them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He said calmly, "I want a bottle of the most expensive perfume you have here as a gift for my fianc&eacute;e."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You want the most expensive one?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The woman became excited, but her smile turned awkward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The most expensive one we have here may not be suitable for you. Why don't you take a look at the others?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She began to recommend other perfumes to Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander frowned and wondered what they meant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Originally, Alexander didn't necessarily buy the most expensive one, as he would have to see if the scent was suitable. However, the two women's very abnormal behavior aroused his suspicion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He said indifferently, "What do you mean? I want to see the most expensive perfume you have here first."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander looked dominating. The two women were immediately frightened so much that they trembled and looked gloomy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The atmosphere seemed to be embarrassing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Sir, which perfume would you like to buy?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this time, a pleasant female voice was heard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When Alexander turned around, the first thing that caught his attention was that woman's beautiful legs wrapped in silk stockings.</span></p><div class="pagination">
