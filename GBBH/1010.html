  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This time, Windwolf did not strike empty-handed. Instead, he drew a sharp dagger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The gleaming blade swept towards Betty. The sharp wind from the blade was already lifting her long hair and was reaching her neck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Be careful!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The members of the Ultimate Alliance shouted in unison.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Tears welled up in their eyes. They wanted to save Betty, but they couldn't match Windwolf's speed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Betty was frozen in fear, unable to dodge in time. She could only shut her eyes in despair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Windwolf showed a cold and triumphant smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The knife howled as it swiftly approached Betty's neck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the next second, Betty would surely lose her head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At the life-or-death moment, suddenly, a sharp sound rang out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Windwolf's dagger snapped in two, one piece falling to the ground, missing its target.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A stunned silence fell over the room, and everyone was frozen in place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Windwolf's face turned pale as he tried to figure out what happened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His hand trembled. The dagger had broken from a forceful attack, but he couldn't see the enemy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A small stone, no bigger than a soybean, rolled across the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Someone had used this tiny, bean-sized stone to break Windwolf's dagger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Not only was Windwolf dumbfounded, but Betty was too.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the next moment, a look of joy spread across her face. She knew it had to be Alexander coming to her rescue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She knew that no one else could possess such strong power except Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Asher narrowed his eyes with dark expression. His skills were not bad, even stronger than Windwolf's in some ways.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Just now, Windwolf's dagger had been broken by a stone, yet Asher hadn't seen who did it or how it was done.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even if Asher had given his all, it would have been hard to break a knife with just a stone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Humph! You failed at causing trouble at the Brilliant Group, so now you've come to stir things up with us at Ultimate Alliance. Asher, you've chosen the wrong path."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A cold and angry voice echoed from outside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone's hearts clenched at once. The people from Ultimate Alliance felt a surge of hope and excitement while Asher's side turned grim and tense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone turned in unison, staring at the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A bloodied figure crawled in, groaning in pain. He reached out to Asher for help, but before he could say a word, someone yanked him away, and a shrill scream followed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Asher had stationed dozens of men by the door, but now they were nowhere to be seen. It was clear they were done for.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander's figure appeared at the door, his cold gaze locking onto Asher.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Asher couldn't help but shudder before revealing a savage grin on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He had come prepared. He had anticipated Alexander's appearance, knowing that Alexander was skilled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Asher had made sure to prepare himself for this moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He had already predicted that, so besides Windwolf, there were two other level-two metahumans hidden in the crowd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He felt that with Windwolf, the three powerful metahumans, plus himself, they could overwhelm Alexander. There was no way Alexander could resist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Alexander, you finally showed up!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Betty cried out in joy, rushing into Alexander's arms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander patted her cheek, gently wiping away the tears from her eyes, and grinned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Silly girl, why are you crying? Just wait and see how I get you your revenge!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Betty laughed through tears and her voice was filled with relief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Yeah, Asher is such a jerk! He forced me to surrender and wanted me to sleep with him..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A cold glint flashed in Alexander's eyes, his voice low and menacing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You are my woman, Betty. Whoever dares to make you sleep with him, I will make him die."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His domineering words made everyone shudder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Asher's face darkened further.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Alexander, don't get too smug. I've been waiting for you, and now you've delivered yourself right to my doorstep.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Hand over the magic powder formula and beg me for forgiveness, now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Asher's voice grew more and more furious as he recalled everything Alexander had done at West Cemetery. He was itching to kill Alexander right then and there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He had come prepared. With three metahumans on his side, plus himself, he was certain they could handle Alexander. So, Asher was confident in his success.</span></p><div class="pagination">
