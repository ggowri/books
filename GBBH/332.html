  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quentin frowned and looked at the time. Almost two hours had passed, but Alexander did not come back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Call him," Reynard ordered his men.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, Walter quickly took out his cell phone and dialed Alexander's number.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He turned on the hands-free, and the prompt sound of waiting for the connection was audible to everyone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander didn't answer the phone until it automatically hung up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Walter called him again, but this time, the call was completely disconnected, and it said that the other party was already on the phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quentin's face immediately turned gloomy, and he thought maybe Alexander really ran away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adam laughed triumphantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Thompson, I am now 100% sure that he is a liar. The fact that Mr. Scott Thompson was awake just now was just a coincidence. It's not that Alexander's credit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Thompson, I advise you to wait patiently for the dark wizard I have hired. He </span><span>will definitely restore Mr. Scott Thompson to health."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quentin was silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brittany frowned, not knowing what to say.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had a hunch that Alexander was not lying, and he would definitely come back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh! You've all been fooled. If he wanted to come back, he would have come back a long time ago. It's obvious that he can't cure Mr. Scott Thompson, so he runs away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Maybe this necklace is harmful to Mr. Scott Thompson!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Madison said this, she rushed over, ripped off the necklace from Scott, threw it to the ground, and stomped on it a few times.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, several cracks appeared on the gemstone, and the Esoteric Pattern lost its function of gathering energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brittany asked angrily, "Madison, what are you doing?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Madison spread her hands in disdain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Brittany, I told you that guy is a liar. I'm doing this for Scott's sake, and this necklace is definitely something harmful."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, something strange happened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Scott, lying on the hospital bed, let out a scream and a dark spot appeared on his forehead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The dark spread strangely under his skin, soon covering his entire face, and then quickly spread to his whole body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, Scott was still twitching, and drops of dark blood flowed out of his nostrils and eyes, emitting a very unpleasant fishy smell.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone was terrified and stared blankly at Scott.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Madison trembled all over and stammered, "This... What's going on?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adam's expression was extremely gloomy, and he gritted his teeth and said, "It's really a witch insect... and a witch insect that I've never seen or heard of before. This witch insect is really good at hiding..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brittany was immediately furious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madison, you bitch! I told you not to touch the necklace, but you insisted on doing so. You want to kill Scott, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She went over, grabbed Madison, and pushed her to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quentin became even angrier and slapped her several times, causing her mouth to bleed and feeling dizzy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Adam, look at what Madison has done! Since you also know that it is a witchcraft insect, why don't you think of a solution?" Quentin roared at Adam.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Adam was helpless and stammered, ""Mr. Thompson, I'm sorry. I have never seen this kind of </span><span>witch</span><span> insect. I am just a gray wizard, and we should wait for the </span><span>dark wizard I invited..."""</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before he could finish his words, Quentin kicked him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're just a useless person!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adam staggered back several steps, then ran outside, holding his aching stomach.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, Brittany also got angry at Madison.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If anything happens to Scott, I will never forgive you. Get out of here now, and I won't have a shameless friend like you anymore!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Madison was completely frightened and stumbled away in a panic with Adam.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Scott! You have to hold on. Hold on a little longer. Alexander will be back soon."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quentin picked up the necklace on the ground and put it back on him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the gemstone that served as the pendant had cracked, and the Esoteric Pattern had been destroyed. It could not gather the vital energy between heaven and earth and could not suppress the runaway witch insect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Scott...Scott, you must hold on!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brittany's eyes were filled with tears, and her makeup was ruined by her tears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the dark area on Scott's body was getting larger and larger. Seeing that his whole body was about to turn dark, the Thompson family was already in despair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, the figure that everyone was looking forward appearing. Alexander was back!</span></p><div class="pagination">
