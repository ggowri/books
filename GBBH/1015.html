  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Keith indeed had a few clues.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Through his connection with Chaalis, he had managed to gain the trust of certain members of the Sakra Society.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although Keith hadn't earned full trust yet, he was already considered a low-ranking member.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Some people in the Sakra Society even hoped to cultivate Keith. After all, he was the newly-risen star of Dragon Film and Television Company and could potentially be used as an undercover agent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Logically, Keith should not have passed the test so quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But his status played a significant role. And although Chaalis had lost favor within Sakra Society, she still had some connections.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thanks to these two factors, Keith had made swift progress.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, he knew well enough that he hadn't yet gained full trust. He was still a low-ranking member without much power or the right to inquire about secrets.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Keith got out of bed and reached for the crystal token on his pillow. It was the identity badge that indicated his place in Sakra Society.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Every man in Sakra Society had a woman they could control, and Keith was Chaalis' master.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Chaalis, under control and subjugated, wore a bull tag that matched Keith's.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was just like Hazel and the man known as "Cyclops". They were a pair, too.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Master, why are you up so early? I wanted you to stay in bed with me a little longer..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At that moment, Chaalis, naked, slithered around him from behind, curling her body around Keith like a seductive serpent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The crystal bull tag hung loosely around her neck, swinging as it brushed against her exaggerated, slightly sagging, yet plump breasts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In fact, Chaalis had once held a fairly high position in Sakra Society. She was a woman discarded by one of the higher-ups who had grown bored of her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In Sakra Society, women were expendable at any time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Luckily, Chaalis still had connections from her earlier days, which allowed Keith to join Sakra Society without much trouble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Keith coldly ordered, "A little longer? Get out, make breakfast for me, or I'll teach you a lesson."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Master..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Chaalis whined, trying to play coy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Keith delivered a sharp slap to Chaalis' face, sending her sprawling back onto the bed. The force of the slap was unmistakable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Chaalis whimpered, clutching her face. Although her expression showed some pain, there was an unmistakable smirk on her face, as if she derived strange pleasure from the punishment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Get out. Hurry up and make breakfast, you filthy whore!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Keith cursed without mercy. This woman had a masochistic streak. The more cruelly he treated her, the happier she became.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Master, I'll go right away. Please don't scold me..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Chaalis clutched her burning cheek, not daring to waste any more time. She quickly got off the bed and ran out naked, deliberately swaying her ample hips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her large, jiggling breasts and hips swayed in a deliberate attempt to seduce Keith.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Keith ignored her and shut the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What a filthy slut!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Keith sneered. He was beginning to react like a normal man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Honestly, women like her could easily stir the primal instincts and desires of any man, making them crave more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Don't get distracted by women... I need to focus on completing the mission. I must find Ms. Walsh!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Damn, Cyclops, where are you hiding?" He thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Keith took a deep breath, forcing his desires to subside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He had kicked Chaalis out for a reason. He was setting his sights on another young woman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This woman was young and beautiful, and like Keith, she had only recently joined Sakra Society. She was being favored by one of the higher-ups, enjoying a brief period of glory.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If Keith wanted to track down Hazel, he needed to start by gaining access to the higher ranks of Sakra Society.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Because Cyclops held a relatively high position in Sakra Society, Keith needed to get closer to the upper echelons.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Keith opened a custom chat client on his phone, a communication tool used by the Sakra Society. It boasted top-tier encryption and anti-tracking technology.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Every member of Sakra Society used this app, most of them being anonymous, hiding their locations to prevent tracking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When Keith had first joined Sakra Society, he'd been lucky enough to meet the leader's favorite.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He quickly navigated the app and connected with a woman named Paula Ortiz.</span></p><div class="pagination">
