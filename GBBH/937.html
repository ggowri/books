  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Timothy and his group were all drunk, the table a mess of cups and plates, with several empty bottles rolling around the deck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By the time Alexander and his team arrived at Treasure Island, dawn was nearly upon them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The convoy sped through the dim streetlights, and as they reached an intersection, Alexander suddenly signaled for the driver to stop.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The driver slammed on the brakes, the tires screeching as the car came to a halt on the side of the road.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get lost, you thugs! Or I'll call for help!" A woman's voice drifted faintly from somewhere in the distance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though the voice was faint, the air was still enough that Alexander's keen senses could pick up every word, even from hundreds of meters away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He opened the car door and stepped out, striding toward the source of the voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The area was dimly lit, but his exceptional vision allowed him to see clearly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Around a corner a hundred meters away, a young woman was stumbling, clearly intoxicated. She wore a black trench coat over a tight-fitting top that accentuated her graceful figure, and her short skirt revealed long, slender legs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wobbled unsteadily, struggling to keep her balance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were four men around her, grinning lecherously, making inappropriate advances. They were clearly trouble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey, beautiful, what's the rush? Come on, let's grab another drink together," one of the men, a greasy-looking fat guy, said as he reached for her waist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get off me! If you keep bothering me, I'll call the patrol team. You know the laws of Treasure Island, don't you?" the woman snapped, struggling to break free.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing her mention the patrol team and the law, the men froze, glancing around nervously, but finding no one else in sight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The fat man's anger flared. "Damn bitch! How dare you try to scare us? Grab her! Take her back and have some fun!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The men rushed forward, one covering her mouth, another pinning her hands, while the fat one wrapped his arms around her waist and lifted her off her feet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clearly, this wasn't their first time; they subdued her with ease and dragged her into a dark alley nearby.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The woman was too drunk to fight back effectively, and despite her desperate struggles, she couldn't break free.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They shoved her against a wall, covering her mouth to muffle her cries, and began groping her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The fat man, the leader of the group, grinned with excitement, lowering his head to bury his face in her chest and began shamelessly biting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The woman's muffled cries were all she could manage, her fear evident in her wide eyes as she tried to scream, but only weak, pitiful sounds escaped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Haha, lucky us! We've got a real gem here tonight!" the fat man laughed. "Bob, hurry up and take your turn, or I'll start without you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Look at this figure! Soft and big. I'm </span><span>gonna</span><span> make her regret this," one of the men sneered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hold off for a minute. If the patrol team shows up, we're done for," another man warned, holding back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bob grinned wickedly and pulled out some rope to bind the woman's hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her eyes were filled with terror, two tears of despair rolling down her cheeks. With her mouth covered, she couldn't scream louder than a desperate whimper.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Such a slut, wearing a thong, huh?" one of the men leered, while they roughly tied her up with the rope.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, a calm, cold voice pierced through the air. "What do you think you're doing?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The men froze, startled, their bodies shaking with fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before they could react, a fierce gust of wind whipped through the alley, and then&mdash;bang! Bob was sent flying with a single kick from Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Weighing at least 200 pounds, he was tossed like a ragdoll, his body crashing to the ground with a sickening thud.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His head slammed into the pavement, and his eyes rolled back, knocked unconscious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bob! What happened to you?" one of the men screamed, rushing to help Bob.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without a sound, Alexander appeared before them, his deep eyes cold as ice, as if he were looking at dead men.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"According to the laws of Treasure Island, you all deserve to die."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A murderous intent flickered in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Treasure Island was his home, and no one was allowed to break its rules.</span></p><div class="pagination">
