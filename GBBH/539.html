  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The people around him looked at him with contempt and laughed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Farrow has four to five hundred people under him. There is nothing he can't do."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I heard that Mr. Farrow had committed dozens of murders!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Really? But I saw he was very polite just now. He was so generous and gave me such a big tip."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The waiter smiled, thinking they were joking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's because Mr. Hawthorne inside is even more powerful!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who exactly is Mr. Hawthorne?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The waiter asked curiously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shut up. If you want to live longer, don't ask about this kind of thing!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After discussing it for a while, they quickly decided to stop talking about it, otherwise, they would get into trouble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hoson</span><span> came to the door of the restaurant and waited patiently. His back was slightly sweaty and his hand kept wiping his forehead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Originally, </span><span>Hoson</span><span> was a little unconvinced about Alexander, but as soon as he saw Alexander, his heart beat faster and he became uneasy, feeling like a little lamb seeing a tiger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come here, don't be so polite."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander finally put down his fork.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only then did </span><span>Hoson</span><span> dare to lower his head and walk over gently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A beautiful and cool young woman was peeling an orange for Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hoson</span><span> shuddered and stared at the woman with wide eyes. He wondered if she was Brittany.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The granddaughter of Quentin was peeling oranges for Alexander like a servant. </span><span>Hoson</span><span> was a little confused, and his heart was beating wildly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was even more in awe of Alexander and didn't even dare to breathe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After waiting for a while, Alexander finally finished eating the oranges and picked up his phone to call Cloe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shouldn't several people be coming? Why is </span><span>Hoson</span><span> the only one here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's my fault for not managing them properly. After all, they are in </span><span>Kingsdon</span><span>, and I can't control them. Alexander, I'm sorry!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the other end of the phone, Cloe looked gloomy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Brilliant Group had been operating in the north for a long time and still had some influence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But since Guzman's death, the Brilliant Group fell into the hands of Cloe, and some people in </span><span>Kingsdon</span><span> were dissatisfied with this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Originally, there were supposed to be four guys coming. They all started their careers with the help of the Brilliant Group and were the power of the Brilliant Group in </span><span>Kingsdon</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As a result, only </span><span>Hoson</span><span> came now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm sorry, Alexander, I betrayed your trust... Please punish me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cloe apologized again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smiled and said, "This is not your fault. Some people think that with Guzman dead, they are free and can start their own business. I will help you clean up what needs to be cleaned up."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, Cloe breathed a sigh of relief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When </span><span>Hoson</span><span> saw Alexander hung up the phone, he hurried forward and knelt to greet him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Nice to meet you, Mr. Hawthorne."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knelt on one knee in front of Alexander and saluted respectfully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander said calmly, "I heard Cloe talk about you. You were one of the first people to enter the Brilliant Group."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hoson</span><span> nodded hurriedly and said, "Yes, thanks to the group's care for me, I have achieved what I have today."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's eyes revealed a fierce murderous intent, and he asked in a cold voice, "Why didn't the others come?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hoson</span><span> felt a fierce momentum coming towards him, wiped the cold sweat off his forehead, and said in a trembling voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Johnathan, the leader of the Lauren family, which was the leader of the disobedience, defected to the Morris family not long ago, and the others followed suit and became the Morris family's lackeys. So..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hoson</span><span> kept wiping his sweat while explaining.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smiled and said, "It's the Morris family again, so why didn't you seek support from the Morris family?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, I am a member of the Brilliant Group forever. I will never betray the Brilliant Group. Without the group, I would not be where I am today."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hoson</span><span> said this seriously, with a very determined expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You are very smart! I came here mainly to find Felix, and he has also teamed up with the Morris family. I originally wanted to gather you together to eliminate Felix and the Morris family, but I didn't expect them to surrender to the enemy first."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hoson</span><span> shuddered with fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Could they eliminate the Morris family, the largest family in the north?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bang!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, the door of the hotel was kicked open.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A large group of men in black rushed in aggressively.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The waiters were outnumbered and controlled by them, then they barged in in an extremely arrogant manner.</span></p><div class="pagination">
