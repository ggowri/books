  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander bowed slightly, then scrutinized Oscar.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Since gaining The Force, Alexander could sense the strength of a person's life force.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Oscar's appeared vigorous and healthy on the surface, but his life force carried the scent of illness, like a candle flame about to be extinguished.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He advised, "Sir Stewart, you'd best get a full medical checkup. I'm afraid you might develop Parkinson's in the near future."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Oscar's face immediately darkened.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mr. Hawthorne, I admit I underestimated you before, but there's no need to deliberately curse me, is there?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander couldn't help but chuckle.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This old coot really didn't know what was good for him, assuming Alexander was as petty as he was.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Sir Stewart, if you need help with treatment when the time comes, feel free to contact me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander smiled meaningfully.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Bah! I'm as fit as a fiddle. My grandson is a doctor, for crying out loud. What makes you think I need your treatment?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Oscar stormed off in a huff, waving his hand dismissively.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava quietly complained to Alexander, "Let bygones be bygones. Why did you have to provoke him?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander just chuckled, not explaining.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The couple strolled arm-in-arm out of the building, only to find themselves swarmed by a pack of reporters.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The Saint Group's gala was a who's who of bigwigs and Hollywood stars, and these vultures could smell a story a mile away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Word had spread like wildfire that the Saint Group's CEO was going public about her boyfriend.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The moment Ava and Alexander appeared, the reporters pounced, cameras flashing, and questions flying like bullets from a machine gun.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Ms. Blackburn, how did you and Mr. Hawthorne meet?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mr. Hawthorne, some say you're just a gold digger. Care to comment?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Ms. Blackburn, Mr. Hawthorne, how about an exclusive interview?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava frowned. These reporters were like pesky flies, utterly annoying.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Security guards quickly moved in to hold back the media frenzy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Amidst the chaos, Alexander's eyes suddenly narrowed, his instincts kicking into high gear.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Danger!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His sharp gaze swept the area, instantly locking onto the threat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A middle-aged man with blonde hair and blue eyes stood to the right. His crew cut and chiseled features exuded a deadly aura.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His thick neck and bulging muscles strained against his shirt, marking him as a formidable opponent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander remained impassive, seemingly oblivious to the man's presence. But The Force had already locked onto him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The life force matched the previous sniper assassination attempt. It was undoubtedly the killer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander inwardly rejoiced. The prey had walked right into the trap.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Target confirmed, Alexander!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">William was equally thrilled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As one of the top thirty hitmen on the Dark Web, his last botched job had really pissed him off.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This time, William was dead set on nailing it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even though the target was now the boyfriend of Saint Group's CEO, he couldn't refuse the five million dollars.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">William averted his gaze, careful not to make eye contact with Alexander.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The failed sniper attempt had taught him that his opponent was no ordinary mark. Like himself, Alexander was likely a seasoned veteran with an uncanny sense of danger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His right hand held a voice recorder, feigning an interview. His left hand slowly crept into his waist pack, where a silenced pistol lay primed and ready.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">William slowly turned his gun toward Alexander, pulling the trigger with savage intent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Two muffled pops, barely audible over the clamor of surrounding reporters, went unnoticed by everyone except Alexander.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As expected of a top-notch assassin, meticulous planning and ruthless execution.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Everything was going according to plan, smoothly as silk.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">William was already mentally patting himself on the back, feeling a surge of pride at taking down such a formidable target.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At less than six feet away with two shots fired, William couldn't fathom how Alexander might dodge this time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Unless he wasn't human!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the next instant, William froze in disbelief. Impossible!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The bullets had passed through nothing but a blur, missing their mark entirely.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander, having anticipated this, was ready the moment William squeezed the trigger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tapping into The Force, he pushed off with his foot, and the world seemed to slow to a crawl.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Time itself appeared to stand still, everything moving in slow motion to Alexander's eyes, even the frozen expressions on everyone's faces.</p><div class="pagination">
