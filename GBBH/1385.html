  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ten days later, a group of soldiers delivered three white jade bottles to Alexander, containing a total of nine Docpirin pills.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was delighted as he held the pills.&nbsp;Making them myself was definitely worth it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With these, he was now close to reaching the peak of a level-four warrior. Feeling pleased, he invited Logan and the three Valdez brothers for an outing at Kean Manor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The autumn air was crisp, and the scenery was breathtaking. A hundred miles from Kean Manor, Alexander and a dozen companions galloped across the open plains on tall, powerful horses. The sound of hooves thundered, mingling with their laughter and shouts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When the horses grew tired, they found a forest clearing to rest. The estate guards laid out mats and unpacked large food containers, revealing an array of delicacies&mdash;roast chicken, braised beef, steamed fish, and roast pig.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander, Logan, the three Valdez brothers, Vegeta, and Nova sat together, eating, drinking, and chatting. Spirits were high, and laughter filled the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Alexander noticed that Logan's brows were tightly furrowed as if something was on his mind. Leaning in, Alexander chuckled and asked, "What's on your mind? Something bothering you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Logan grinned. "Alexander, the other day I was talking with Father Liora and learned that the sacred herbs at Hall of Lives grow in blessed land, enhanced by spiritual energy. That's how they have thousand-year-old and even ten-thousand-year-old medicinal plants.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But Sahasia is vast, with billions of people. Hall of Lives's herbs are excellent, but they can't possibly supply everyone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even with Quinton's great leadership and Hrodvik flourishing, it's still difficult for the common folk to access quality medicine. And if a plague or war breaks out, getting medicine would be nearly impossible."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander sighed and nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah... It's always been hard to get medical treatment, and medicine is expensive. You have an idea?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, you know I have experience in cultivating medicinal herbs. We don't have plastic greenhouses here, but we do have transparent glass tiles. There's no electricity, but we have water power. We have manpower. We have land..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Logan spoke passionately, and Alexander's eyes lit up as he listened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Logan's voice grew louder, the others started paying attention.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We need our own brand. We establish large-scale herbal plantations, then set up chain pharmacies. Not only would we be saving lives, but we'd also expand our influence across the world..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By the end, Alexander was breaking into a cold sweat&mdash;Logan had practically brought a modern business model into this world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had only ever heard about these ideas from TV and the internet, but they sounded promising.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Logan finally stopped talking and took a big gulp of liquor to quench his thirst.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sellers and his brothers exchanged glances and nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Some of this is beyond us, but Logan, you're clearly a genius. Thanks to Alexander last time, we won fifty thousand coins in the tournament. We want in on this project&mdash;it benefits the nation, the people, and ourselves."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vegeta stood up, bowed to Logan, and said in a deep voice, "Back in Noah Continent, my tribe suffered countless deaths due to a lack of medicine. I will do whatever it takes to help."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's heart swelled with excitement. He raised his bowl and shouted, "Come on! Let's drink&mdash;to a cause that benefits the nation, the people, and ourselves!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone stood up, raised their bowls, and drank in one go.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander tossed his bowl aside and pulled Logan into a hug. In a low voice, he said, "You've really made something of yourself."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Logan's eyes reddened. He thought of his parents.&nbsp;"By the time they grow old and gray... will I ever be able to go back?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A tree wishes for stillness, but the wind won't cease; a child wishes to care for their parents, but they are no longer there...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After everyone had eaten their fill, it was getting late. The group mounted their warhorses and rode back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In Courtyard 509 of the Dominion Church's Outer Court, Rhodes Monroe sat in the hall, staring blankly at a wooden chest and a small box on the table.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The chest was made of golden nanmu wood and contained banknotes worth two hundred thousand coins.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the most significant item was a thin booklet, small enough to fit in a palm. It wasn't made of gold or silk, yet its cover bore bold, striking characters&mdash;Thunderstrike Manual. It had just been delivered by Madden Wetherall's steward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Thunderstrike Manual!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Madden Wetherall, a level-five warrior, had entered Dominion Church as a laborer at the age of six. By fifteen, he had joined the Outer Court, where he met Quinton. At twenty-four, he became a general.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At thirty-five, he comprehended the essence of martial arts, attained mastery, and condensed the Force into a core, creating his own&nbsp;Thunderstrike Manual, securing his place as a level-five warrior.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>More than a decade had passed since then. No one knew what realm Madden had reached now...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Madden Wetherall had sent the&nbsp;Thunderstrike Manual&nbsp;with just one condition. At the upcoming tournament in a few months, Alexander must die!</span></p><div class="pagination">
