Each increment must not be less than five hundred thousand dollars!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's eyes lit up. With his energy perception, he sensed a similar aura from this bracelet as from the rare gems.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Could these yellow beads hold the same potential as a top-grade yellow gem for upgrading his energy sword?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perfect!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander clenched his fist in excitement; he had to win this bid.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Eighty-one million dollars!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Someone immediately raised their bid card.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Eighty-two million dollars!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander didn't even hesitate, raising the bid by a full million dollars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In auctions, it's not just about who has deeper pockets; it's about showing confidence. If you come across as determined, you can intimidate others into backing down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Alexander join the bidding, several others hesitated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was clear he had deep pockets and wasn't about to give up easily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Eighty-three million dollars!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, a voice rang out from one of the VIP rooms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The voice was calm and commanding&mdash;definitely someone influential from </span><span>Tijuanea</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Eighty-five million dollars!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander, unbothered, raised the bid by two million.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Eighty-eight million dollars!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The voice from the VIP room countered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"One hundred million dollars!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander didn't flinch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd erupted, everyone staring at Alexander, curious about this young, wealthy bidder's background.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not only had he spent big on a rare gem, but now he was also bidding one hundred million for a bracelet. What kind of deep pockets did he have?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nate spat on the ground in frustration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Idiot. Just because you have money doesn't mean you should waste it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Alexander stayed cool, a faint smile on his face, radiating confidence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The room quieted again, all eyes on the showdown.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The VIP room remained silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a moment, the door opened, and an elderly man with white hair stepped out, his face stern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Can you do me, Leonard Moon, a solid favor?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd gasped, whispering in excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's the famous diviner, Leonard Moon. This bracelet must really be something special, maybe even magical!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is that young guy out of his mind trying to go up against Master Moon?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shh, keep it down! Leonard Moon isn't someone you want to mess with. If he curses you, you're in big trouble!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A curse? Yeah, let's not talk about this anymore..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The room fell silent once again. Everyone looked at Leonard Moon with a mix of awe and fear while feeling a surge of sympathy for Alexander&mdash;how unfortunate to cross paths with a character like Moon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, mystics and diviners were an enigma, often rumored to possess curses and dark powers that could harm others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leonard Moon saw that Alexander hadn't responded and assumed he was backing down, a satisfied smile forming on his lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This bracelet is very important to me. If you're willing to let it go, I'll owe you a favor. I can even give you a free reading. What do you say?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clearly, Alexander raising the bid to one hundred million dollars had surpassed what Leonard was willing to spend.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Alexander simply smiled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sorry, Master Moon, but this bracelet is important to me too. Let's stick to the rules&mdash;may the highest bid win."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leonard's face darkened, and he said nothing more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"One hundred million dollars, going once, going twice... sold!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Congratulations to this gentleman for winning the valuable bracelet!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On stage, Leo Jenkins was so excited his voice trembled slightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Honestly, they hadn't expected this item to sell for much.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They set the high starting price banking on its antiquity, hoping to snag an uninformed buyer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But they never imagined it would reach a hundred million dollars&mdash;what a windfall!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leonard Moon stormed back into his VIP room, clearly furious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander knew, though, that Leonard's eyes were fixed on him, filled with malice. He also noticed Leonard had taken out a deck of silver tarot cards.</span></p><div class="pagination">
