  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kyle was furious. He grabbed Charlize and slapped her face hard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The scorching flame energy seared her cheek, making a terrifying sizzling sound and sending up puffs of gray smoke.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Charlize screamed in agony and passed out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dying so quickly. That's too easy for you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kyle discarded Charlize like trash and barked at his men, "Stop standing around! Take Ashley away!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The men quickly lifted Ashley into the car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Poor Ashley was bound and gagged, utterly defenseless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ashley struggled to make a sound.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Purnell, save me..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ella, however, seemed not to hear, standing there as if she had lost her soul.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's go. What are you waiting for?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kyle pulled her into his arms and carried her into a minivan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ella dared not resist and could only let Kyle take advantage of her, tears streaming down her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you cry, I'll burn your face!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kyle threatened Ella viciously, silencing her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You were born a servant of the Vanderbilt family. Anyone can have you. Felix is my nephew. He won't mind. Come on. Let me touch..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kyle leered, reaching out to cover Ella's ample bosom, feeling it up and down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thanks to Felix's frequent training and nourishment, Ella's breasts had become even more voluptuous and tempting, and her body extremely sensitive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ella couldn't help but moan, her body already limp and powerless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What a little tease. You're so eager."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kyle pinched Ella's chin, his lustful expression growing more twisted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He deliberately caressed her slowly, lewdly laughing as he watched Ella struggle, satisfying his perverted mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"God... Save me..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ella was filled with despair, tears streaming down her cheeks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though she was unwilling, her body was loyal. Kyle pressed her against the car seat, lifting her plump buttocks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her skirt was torn, revealing her smooth buttocks and a pink thong in the cleavage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kyle salivated at the sight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, you're such a little tease, even wearing something so provocative to work. It's pink. I like it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He went mad, pressing against her, sniffing desperately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A moist scent mixed with sweat assaulted his nostrils, driving Kyle wild. It was too tempting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't sniff..." Ella cried, shaking her head desperately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shut up!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kyle slapped her plump buttocks hard, the flesh quivering enticingly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't resist any longer. He quickly removed his pants, grabbed Ella's buttocks, and tore open the pink thong.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ella's red lips opened wide, her beautiful face filled with reluctance, sadness, and deep desire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The driver, while driving, couldn't help but admire the lascivious scene, swallowing hard and stepping on the gas.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The minivan sped away even faster.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Ava and her team arrived at the kindergarten, they only found Charlize and her team members lying in pools of blood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone else was dead. Charlize, due to her strength, was still breathing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava gasped in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Half of Charlize's face was charred, and her body bore terrible burns. It was horrifying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get her to the hospital. Save her life no matter how much it costs!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava ordered, and the stunned subordinates quickly lifted Charlize, preparing to take her to the car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Charlize barely opened her eyes and whispered in a feeble voice, "Ashley... They are from the Red Umbrella Group. Ella... She's with them... The metahuman and fire power. Very dangerous..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Charlize passed out again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava turned furious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She kicked the chair beside her, grinding her teeth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bastards! The Red Umbrella Group kidnapped a four-year-old child!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosalia searched the entire kindergarten carefully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Blackburn, there's no one here. What do we do now?"</span></p><div class="pagination">
