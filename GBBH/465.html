  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava's stunning figure was on full display, her chest rising and falling with every breath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her slim waist, perfect round hips, and those white lace thong panties&mdash;it was almost too much for Alexander to handle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Like what you see?" Ava asked playfully, striking a pose while watching Alexander's reaction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander felt like he was about to burst out of his pants.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Whoa, what's gotten into you today? You're being really forward."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't you like it? Didn't you tell Rosalia you like it when a girl is bold?" Ava smiled, </span><span>and her voice sultry as she reached for Alexander's penis.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Heat surged through him, and he wrapped her up in his arms without a second thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava blushed, smiling as she said, "Can't even hold out for a minute, huh? Well, consider this your reward for dealing with Nate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And I want to stay your favorite girl. No one else is taking my place."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Enough talking."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's kisses grew hungry, her curves driving him wild.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This time, I swear I'll last till the end&mdash;no more excuses for you to find someone else," Ava teased, her face flushed, her voice full of determination.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander almost laughed. No matter how long it lasted, it was just going to be a great time for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her soft, supple body moved beneath him, the smooth feeling indescribable, setting his blood on fire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Alexander took his time, hovering, teasing, and never fully giving in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay, okay, I get it. I need you now," Ava moaned, her voice pleading.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Weren't you going to see it through to the end? Why are you giving up so fast?" Alexander laughed, watching her hide her face in embarrassment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But finally, she got what she'd been aching for.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Heavy breathing and soft moans echoed in the room...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>An hour later, Alexander finally let her go, a satisfied smile on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Feeling any better now?" Alexander asked gently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava nodded, her eyes a little softer now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Nate's the type to hold a grudge. He won't just let this go."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander let out a cold laugh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If he knows what's good for him, he'll keep his distance. If he doesn't, he'll regret it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're amazing," Ava smiled, throwing in a bit of flattery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, enough buttering me up. When are we going to see your mom?" Alexander asked, clearly interested.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava rolled her eyes, sighing. "Soon enough."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the way to </span><span>Tijuanea</span><span>, Alexander learned all about Ava's situation with her mom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her mother's name was Lynn. Ava's father had passed away when she was young.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After that, Lynn had a bit of a reputation, always bringing different men home.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Some of those men were creeps who tried things with Ava, which was why she left home&mdash;she couldn't stand her mom anymore. She ended up being taken in by the Godfather and worked her way up to become the CEO of the Saint Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lynn ran a jewelry business and had a precious necklace made from Obsidian Core.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava's tone turned serious, "Charlize's condition is bad. We should head over soon to get that necklace."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, whatever you need."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander pulled her into his arms, patting her gently on the shoulder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>An hour later, Alexander was behind the wheel, driving them away from the hotel towards Ava's mom's place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey, looks like we're being followed." Alexander pointed to the rearview mirror, </span><span>surprised.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who could it be? Timothy and Arthur?" Ava asked, her voice tinged with worry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander let out a dismissive laugh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Nah, those two wouldn't dare. It's probably someone else&mdash;my guess is Nate. What's he </span><span>gonna</span><span> do, flap his wings and fly after us?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava turned to check the rearview mirror, her eyes narrowing at the black BMW tailing them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ugh, it really is that jerk Nate. Shake him off, will you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sure thing. Having someone follow us is just annoying."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander pressed the gas, shifted gears, and expertly maneuvered the car through traffic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Buick glided like a fish through water, weaving in and out of the bustling cars with ease.</span></p><div class="pagination">
