If you have the guts, kill me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melin warned, "I'm not someone to be messed with. If your men dare to move, I'll kill you first."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosen didn't expect her to be so determined, and he became even angrier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He trembled violently from anger and pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry about me. Attack her together and catch her!" he ordered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Two muscular men immediately charged at Melin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melin stared at them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They burst into action, moving very fast.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their muscles bulged with explosive power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get her!" the two men roared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melin was daunted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With their speed and strength, she couldn't handle even one of them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She finally realized that killing Rosen wouldn't help.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Plus, he would resist during the process.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melin quickly backed away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two men grinned and charged at her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, Melin was cornered, and she still had handcuffs on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She stared at the two men intensely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She bent her knees slightly, lowered her shoulders, and got into a fighting stance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melin took deep breaths, forcing herself to calm down and focus on the enemies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosen was now protected by his men.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They surrounded Melin so she couldn't escape. The two muscular men approached her from both sides.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melin's back was covered in cold sweat. She felt like she was being watched by a pack of hyenas.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander could see that although Melin was skilled, she was no match for these elite fighters.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These people were killing machines.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mike, I can handle this woman alone," one of the men said, stopping his partner.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay, remember not to hurt her. We have plans for her later. A woman with such a good figure must be enjoyed," his partner said with a grin, stepping back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Officer, you should stop resisting. You'll only get hurt," the man said with a twisted smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The scars on his face were terrifying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before he could finish, Mike suddenly moved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He leaped from the side, moving incredibly fast, and tried to grab Melin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was disgusted by their cowardly tactics. They had the advantage in numbers but still resorted to sneak attacks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mike's attack was fierce.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melin could only dodge it as best as she could.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Officer, you can't escape!" Mike laughed wickedly and continued to attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it!" Melin was cornered again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her hands were still cuffed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She used all her strength to elbow Mike in the head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Not bad, you've got some moves," Mike smirked, blocking her elbow with his own.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her elbow hit Mike's arm, but he only slightly moved aside and quickly stepped forward to face her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melin was shocked and instinctively kneed Mike in the stomach.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This strike used all her strength. If she missed, she would lose her balance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unexpectedly, Mike was prepared. He sidestepped and punched Melin in the right rib.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a cry of pain, Melin was thrown to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She held her right side and sweated in pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man was faster and stronger than her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Melin's fighting skills were not inferior, the handcuffs greatly affected her performance.</span></p><div class="pagination">
