  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was a huge underground warehouse with a space more than ten meters high and at least tens of thousands of square meters.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The room was neatly filled with green boxes, both long and short.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inside the box are bullets, grenades, and various firearms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were dozens of tall weapon cabinets around, hung with various firearms, including fully automatic assault rifles, various types of submachine guns, and even machine guns.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not only that, there were also mines for various purposes, gas masks, biochemical protection combat suits, etc.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the other side of the warehouse, there were even dozens of armored </span><span>infantry</span><span> fighting vehicles and a dozen battle tanks parked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although these combat vehicles were just outdated weapons, they still had terrifying lethality.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The terrifying </span><span>amount</span><span> of weapons stored here was enough to arm an elite combat battalion. Alexander was very happy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although weapons could be purchased in </span><span>Loscity</span><span>, they were not fully automatic heavy firepower. The heavy firepower here was comparable to that of the army.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander looked over with a smile on his face, and at the same time used Force Sense to perceive his surroundings to see if Guzman had set any traps here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He suddenly heard a slight noise and his sharp eyes immediately swept towards the corner.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He saw a little mouse hiding in the darkness and looking at this side. After sensing Alexander's terrifying eyes, the mouse trembled and was so scared that it couldn't escape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smiled slightly and withdrew the Force that was locking onto the mouse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly the mouse regained its freedom and quickly ran away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alice and Cloe, who were walking behind him, noticed this scene and were shocked that Alexander had such terrifying strength!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even mice could not escape his eyes and control.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this time, Alexander opened a rectangular black iron box.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inside was a Stinger anti-aircraft missile launcher, equipped with two missiles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The rich smell of gun oil hit Alexander's nose. These weapons were well-preserved and could be used right out of the box.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ordinary armed organizations couldn't have anti-aircraft missiles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now there were dozens of similar black iron boxes in front of Alexander. It was obvious that they were all anti-aircraft missiles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Good!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was overjoyed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I want to transport a small portion of these weapons and ammunition to </span><span>Loscity</span><span>. Is there any way?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander looked at the two beauties.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, don't worry, Mr. Hawthorne. We have a special delivery channel that is very safe. Leave this to me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cloe had already followed Alice in calling Alexander Mr. Hawthorne, completely displaying a humble attitude of submission.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay, do it quickly." Alexander was very satisfied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes!" Cloe quickly arranged for people to start transporting weapons and ammunition.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In just over an hour, enough weapons and ammunition to arm an entire company were transported to a container ship at the dock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander secretly rejoiced that he had made the right decision to come to Treasure Island this time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not only did he control Treasure Island and the Brilliant Group, but they also obtained </span><span>nearly 100 billion of Guzman's wealth. These weapons and ammunition were just bonuses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After timely blood transfusion treatment, Cloe temporarily regained her ability to move, but her face was still pale and she had not fully recovered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander patted her shoulder lightly, and a surge of Force flowed into her, instantly cheering up Cloe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Cloe, the power I left in your body can help you recover quickly and improve your physical fitness."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you, Mr. Hawthorne!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cloe was overjoyed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Alexander suddenly changed his attitude and said coldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But if you betray me, this power will stir in your body, tearing your intestines apart, and no one will be able to save you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cloe was so frightened that her whole body was shaking. She lowered her head with a pale face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne, don't worry. You saved my life. I am not an ungrateful person!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander nodded with satisfaction and took Alice onto the ship.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He trusted Cloe, but he didn't trust human nature.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As time went by, the original life-saving grace may fade.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander would see whether Cloe could remain loyal when tempted by sufficiently lucrative benefits.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander would never gamble on human nature but would use more direct means to keep everything firmly under his control.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was better for Cloe. She would remember who the real master was all the time.</span></p><div class="pagination">
