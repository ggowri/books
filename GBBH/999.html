  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next morning, Augusta stood with a smug grin, looking down at Asher and Axel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Daybreak's here. Time for you to get out of </span><span>Loscity</span><span>. If I catch sight of you in this city again, I'll find a nice plot of land to bury you," he yelled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Asher's face twisted with rage, his blood boiling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Axel restrained Asher. With a wobbly movement, he got his feet with Asher supporting his arm. They made their exit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their convoy was still lined up obediently, but the once-mighty bodyguards were now dead. Only the drivers remained.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Vance! Sir Vance! Are you all right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the two men emerged, the drivers scurried over to greet them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once inside the car, Axel let out a long, agonizing sigh. He had knelt in front of that tombstone all night, which had nearly killed him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander," he vowed through clenched teeth, "if I don't take revenge on you, I won't be a man!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Asher's eyes sparkled with a sudden light, only to dim with sorrow as he inquired, "Grandpa, with Gavin backing Alexander, we don't stand a chance! What are we going to do?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Axel's eyes gleamed with a sinister light as he sneered, "The key to Alexander's power is that damn magic powder. The woman by his side was Ava Blackburn, the president of the Brilliant Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Brilliant Group isn't just the distributor of the powder; they're the manufacturer. If we get our hands on Ava, we get the formula. Once we have that, Alexander becomes worthless in the eyes of Gavin and his cronies. Without their protection, killing him will be as easy as squashing a bug."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By noon, Ava and her mother, Lynn, were just getting out of bed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The previous night had been rough. Alexander had worn them out completely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he finally rose in the morning, he was full of energy, touching, hugging, and kissing both mother and daughter until they were gasping for breath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Alexander finally let them go, half the day had already slipped by.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lynn chuckled bitterly, "Alexander is such a potent man. Thank God he has other women around. If it were just us, we wouldn't be able to handle him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava couldn't help but laugh, nodding in agreement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She felt relieved, honestly grateful, that Alexander had other women. It gave her some breathing room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>An hour later, Ava arrived at her office.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bang!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had barely sat down when someone knocked on the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before she could say a word, the door swung open, and Grace, the daughter of the Lawson family, walked in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You? Ms. Lawson, what on earth brings you here?" Ava asked. Her gaze filled with a cocktail of wonder and bewilderment as she took in the sight of Grace standing there unannounced at her doorstep.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grace had become the talk of </span><span>Loscity</span><span>, and Ava hadn't expected her to show up uninvited.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without a word, Grace placed a stack of documents and a check in front of Ava.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What do you mean?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava frowned and stared at Grace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grace smiled, her voice dripping with arrogance, "Alexander and I are a perfect match. You should leave him. I'm not an unreasonable person. If you sign this confidentiality agreement and leave the country, </span><span>this 10 billion dollars</span><span> will be yours."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava gaped at Grace as if Grace had just uttered the most absurd thing imaginable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ave announced, "Are you out of your mind? You should check yourself into a mental hospital. Alexander is my boyfriend. I'm not leaving him, no matter what.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A billion dollars? Even if you offered me 10 billion dollars, I wouldn't leave him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grace's smile vanished, her face going cold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ava, don't test my patience. You're just a high-level employee. Before I do something we'll both regret, you should leave Alexander voluntarily. Otherwise," Grace warned, "you'll end up in a place where you'll regret ever crossing me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Grace reached into her bag and pulled out a small silver pistol.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava was stunned as a mix of anger and anxiety flooded her senses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Grace, you're a lunatic! If you lay a finger on me, Alexander will make sure you and your entire family regret it!" she yelled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For a moment, Grace's confidence wavered. She hesitated and frowned. But then, she deflated like a punctured balloon and angrily shoved the pistol back into her bag.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ava, you must leave Alexander. You're not fit to be his girlfriend. He and I are meant for each other. Why are you fighting this?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Name your price. If one billion dollars isn't enough, I'll go higher. Just tell me what it takes."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grace was desperate now, switching between threats and bribes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava studied her face, searching for any sign of deception or acting. But there was none. Grace was dead serious.</span></p><div class="pagination">
