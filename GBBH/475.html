Leo announced with pride.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Every diamond has undergone rigorous inspection to ensure top quality, including the main pendant diamond.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If anyone has doubts, they can have it verified by any certification agency. If any </span><span>discrepancies are found, we, as the hosts, guarantee a full refund, doubled!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leo assured confidently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The first piece is by Master Rowan himself&mdash;impressive!" someone whispered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sky Heart is gorgeous. The starting price must be at least five million dollars," another murmured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd buzzed with excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leo, still beaming, announced, "Ladies and gentlemen, the starting bid for Sky Heart is five million dollars, with increments of no less than fifty thousand dollars. Let the bidding begin!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Five million and a hundred thousand dollars!" someone immediately called out, raising their number.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Five million and a hundred and fifty thousand dollars!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Five million and three hundred thousand dollars!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Five million and five hundred thousand dollars!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The price of Sky Heart kept climbing, with Timothy even jumping in with a bid.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the bidding reached 8.5 million dollars, the number of participants began to dwindle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Many attendees were seasoned jewelry dealers&mdash;they knew Sky Heart's true value was around seven hundred thousand dollars at most.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Going higher would be unwise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We have a bid of eight million and five hundred thousand dollars&mdash;first call!" Leo called out, clearly enjoying the moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Any more bids? Second call!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His enthusiasm was evident; the first piece had already fetched a great price, promising him a generous commission.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No more bids? Eight million and five hundred thousand dollars&mdash;third call... Sold!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leo brought the gavel down with finality.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Congratulations to Mr. Timothy for securing our first auction item&mdash;Master Rowan's exquisite piece!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Timothy's grin stretched ear to ear. Sky Heart was his.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had promised his lover a stunning necklace, and finally, he could make her day. And in return, he was sure there'd be rewards for him too.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Timothy was lost in his thoughts, Alexander shot him a knowing smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The necklace was indeed gorgeous, and Alexander had initially planned to get it for Ava as a surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But since Timothy had made the purchase, Alexander figured it wouldn't be too hard to acquire it from him later.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Heh..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smirked at Timothy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Timothy suddenly felt a chill, like he'd been targeted by a predator.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next item was a pair of intricately crafted jade bangles, sparking yet another frenzy among the bidders.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At Alexander's subtle cue, Timothy reluctantly placed a bid, eventually winning the bangles for 5.8 million dollars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By now, Timothy's expression had darkened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He finally understood the source of his unease&mdash;it was Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both the necklace and the bangles would ultimately end up with Alexander, meaning the over ten million dollars he'd just spent was essentially wasted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Talk about shooting himself in the foot!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Timothy serving as Alexander's proxy bidder, Alexander remained composed, not making any moves himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't until a rare blue sapphire was brought out that Alexander's interest was visibly piqued.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rare gems were hard to come by, especially blue sapphires of this caliber.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's All-seeing Eyes analyzed the sapphire&mdash;though only the size of a fingertip, it was remarkably pure with minimal inclusions, definitely top-tier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From the energy it emitted, Alexander could sense the powerful and concentrated force within, despite its size.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This one's a must-have," Alexander thought, eyes gleaming with determination.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A rare blue sapphire, with full certification details available on the screen. The starting bid is ten million dollars, with increments of no less than one hundred thousand dollars. Let's begin the bidding!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leo introduced the sapphire confidently, believing this gem would ignite fierce competition.</span></p><div class="pagination">
