  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A few hours later, Alexander, Alice, Xavier, and their group landed at Goldford Airport in Soutaxia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Goldford was renowned as the largest gemstone-producing region in Soutaxia, boasting a wide array of precious stones.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If they couldn't find what they were looking for here, they might as well give up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the private jet, Xavier was sound asleep in his seat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alice sat in Alexander's embrace, playfully flirting as she kissed him repeatedly, wrapping her arms around his neck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne, I've been using that beauty ointment you developed, and my breasts are getting bigger every day. Why don't you touch them and see for yourself?" Alice teased.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unable to resist, Alexander slipped his hand into her collar and gently grasped her full breasts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne, this feels so good," Alice said, lifting her breasts to give him more access.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander could barely hold one with just one hand; they were so soft and inviting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Have you slept with anyone else during this time?" he whispered into her ear, his masculine scent sending tingles down her spine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alice blushed, planting a kiss on his cheek. "With you by my side, how could I be interested in anyone else? Besides, no one else compares to you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander chuckled and said, "You seem quite experienced."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne, you're my only man now, truly!" Alice replied, her cheeks flushed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He picked her up and carried her into the private room. Once inside, he locked the door behind them, leaving them in their own little world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The room, although small&mdash;about 75 square feet&mdash;was equipped with a sofa, a bed, and a bathroom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Such luxury on a plane was a rare treat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alice pushed Alexander onto the sofa and leaned in closer, pressing her soft breasts against his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne, give it to me!" she urged, her body temperature rising rapidly. In a sudden burst of excitement, she tore off her clothes, buttons flying everywhere, revealing a sexy white bra.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That deep cleavage was so captivating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was completely immersed in it, kneading her breasts, marveling at their fullness and elasticity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alice moaned softly, responding to his kisses, lost in the sensation of it all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne, let's have a baby!" she gasped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thought sent a thrill through Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alice climbed onto his lap, taking charge as she guided him inside her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a long flight, the plane finally touched down at Goldford Airport.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander stepped off the plane feeling exhilarated, while Alice appeared flushed and slightly weary.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Xavier pretended to be oblivious, though he couldn't help but feel a stirring interest. </span><span>He knew Alexander and Alice had been doing it in the air for hours and couldn't help but feel aroused.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Xavier envied Alexander and secretly sighed that he was not lucky enough.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was already night.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alice took Alexander's arm and said, "I've booked us a hotel. It's getting late, so we'll head to the gem trading center tomorrow. It's the largest in Soutaxia."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sounds great, thank you. Let's rest tonight," Alexander replied with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's my pleasure, Mr. Hawthorne," Alice beamed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The trio climbed into a car and headed toward one of Goldford's top luxury hotels.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Xavier, having visited Soutaxia numerous times for gemstone purchases, spoke the local language fluently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alice, as the chairman's personal secretary, had also mastered several foreign languages.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander, however, was particularly impressive. Since becoming a Warrior, his memory had sharpened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After listening to the locals for a while, he was able to pick up on meanings and expressions with surprising accuracy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both Alice and Xavier were taken aback, growing even more in awe of him.</span></p><div class="pagination">
