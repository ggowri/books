The only question on her mind was whether she should let Alexander see her like this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Such a bold and sexy outfit was practically risqu&eacute;, and Lynn felt that with her personality, she could hardly bring herself to wear it outside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She hesitated at the threshold of her bedroom, hand on the doorknob.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He is about to see me half-naked."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thought made her heart race and her mouth dry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It puzzled her why she had made such a bold decision.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Taking a deep breath, Lynn finally turned the knob.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a soft click, the door opened, and she stepped out slowly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wasn't trying to be dramatic; her fitted dress was so short that she could only take small, careful steps to avoid revealing more than she intended and she didn't wear panties.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her curves swayed enticingly as she approached Alexander, who stared in astonishment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite having seen many beautiful women, Lynn's presence left him speechless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The fact that she was Ava's mother added a layer of thrill and complexity to the moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In comparison, Ava suddenly seemed a bit more innocent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both shared striking figures&mdash;full curves and long legs&mdash;but Lynn exuded a mature charm that was irresistible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Lynn moved closer, Alexander swallowed hard, unable to take his eyes off her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that moment, she saw his surprise and unmistakable desire reflected in his gaze, which sent a thrill through her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was even happy about Alexander's loss of composure. Her heart raced.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is that dress a birthday gift from Ava?" he asked, feigning casualness as he took a sip from his glass to mask his embarrassment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lynn tossed her hair playfully, her eyes sparkling. "What do you think? Do you like it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her sultry tone nearly sent him over the edge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From where he stood, he had a perfect view of her bosom, the hem of her dress riding high on her thighs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He guessed she didn't wear underwear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Absolutely stunning. You look mesmerizing..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He nodded in genuine admiration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She let out a light, carefree laugh, her confidence radiating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, you certainly know how to make me smile."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander felt a surge of desire, tempted to pull her into an embrace right there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He quickly rubbed his temples, trying to rein in his urges.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they shared drinks, the effects of the magic powder grew stronger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lynn stood up, playfully nudging him. "It's been ages since I danced! Will you join me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course!" he replied earnestly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her eyes lit up with joy. Previously, she had wished to dance with Victor, but he had no rhythm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the sweet music filled the air, Alexander wrapped his left arm around Lynn's waist, his hand resting comfortably on her hip.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His right hand found its way to the same spot, pulling her close into a warm embrace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feeling the heat of his hands, Lynn couldn't suppress a soft sigh, leaning against his chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They swayed together, the intimacy of the moment enveloping them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>An air of romance hung between them, both feeling the rapid beat of their hearts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander could feel the softness of her breast against him, drawing him in further.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lynn's emotions swirled&mdash;she felt gratitude and a hint of guilt towards Alexander, mixed with the magic powder's intoxicating influence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The line between right and wrong blurred, and she found herself reveling in the closeness, lost in the dance.</span></p><div class="pagination">
