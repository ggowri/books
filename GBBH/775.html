  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>More than an hour had passed. Alexander changed positions many times, and his speed only got faster.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He was sweating heavily. He felt Yvonne's body tremble violently and tighten, knowing she had orgasm again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander couldn't remember if this was the fourth or fifth time, but he had no intention of stopping.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He had deliberately sent Alyssa away so he could completely conquer Yvonne's body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He wanted to leave his mark on her body and mind as well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After another ten minutes, Yvonne was completely exhausted. If Alexander hadn't been holding her, she would have fallen to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander continued to hold her and went on for another ten minutes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Only when Yvonne's eyes started to roll up did Alexander finally thrust his manhood into her mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He let out a low growl, and his tailbone tingled as his sperm shot out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yvonne could only endure it. She choked as she swallowed it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Some even flowed down from the corner of her mouth. Alexander couldn't help but slap her buttocks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yvonne lay on the ground and panted, regardless of her image.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>On her plump body, there were red marks left by Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Master, you are the strongest of all men. I love you." Yvonne hugged and rubbed Alexander's leg.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander could see from her eyes that before it was submission, but now there was also a hint of affection and loyalty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This was what Alexander wanted, to conquer Yvonne both mentally and physically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander grabbed Yvonne's plump flesh and asked, "When are we going to the City of Sorcery? I will help you defeat Monica and all who oppose you, making you the ruler."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yvonne became excited and said firmly, "The day after tomorrow. It will be the 100th anniversary of the City of Sorcery. All the wizards will be there, including Monica."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She told Alexander everything honestly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her desire for power was deeply ingrained in her heart. Even though she had become Alexander's servant, Yvonne still had great ambitions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Good, then we will go to the City of Sorcery the day after tomorrow," Alexander said calmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He was confident even facing all the wizards that day.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yvonne was overjoyed. She had faith in Alexander and believed they could succeed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I will burn this place down, and you will come with me," Alexander said, casually throwing out a piece of white flame.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The terrifying heat of the Force instantly set the corpses on fire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the blink of an eye, the castle and over a hundred corpses were engulfed in a sea of fire, with thick black smoke rising to the sky.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander took Yvonne into the car and drove towards the Axe's headquarters.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yvonne looked at Alexander with awe, admiration, and deep love.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In her heart, Alexander had become her only support. He was closer to family and more important than life itself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon, Alexander's car drove away, leaving the castle turned into a blazing inferno. Amid the crackling, smoke spread everywhere.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A few minutes later, a jeep sped over and stopped not far from the castle ruins.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Two dark wizards got out and were shocked by what they saw.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What happened here? Where are Yvonne and Woodrow? This is terrible." The two men ran towards the ruins.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After inspecting the scene for a while, they hurried back to the car and drove away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone was dead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I didn't expect this raid on Mandale Town to fail. The 100th anniversary is coming up. We should go back and celebrate first, and then see how Ms. Quinn handles it." The two men didn't dare to stay.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At the Axe's headquarters, Alyssa and her subordinates were eagerly waiting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"He's back. Finally, he's back."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing Alexander's car speeding towards them, Alyssa and Xavier, who had been worried, cheered excitedly.</span></p><div class="pagination">
