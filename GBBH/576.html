  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Heh, I'll head to the Morris Villa first. Let them go after Alexander. I'll just sit back and watch them tear each other apart! Maybe I'll even get a few idiots like Barry to strengthen my forces."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Deciding his plan, Felix got in his sports car and headed toward the Morris Villa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Morris family's headquarters was nestled hundreds of miles away in a hidden valley, surrounded by towering mountains, some of which were snow-covered year-round.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luckily, Felix had been there once before; otherwise, he'd definitely get lost.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the way, Felix planned how he'd report to the head of the Morris Villa, planning to pin all the blame on Alexander and The Kaylon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With his current powers, he was at least as strong as Barry and, in fact, even stronger. Among the Morris Villa, he was definitely one of the </span><span>top</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix felt full of confidence. It was like going from zero to hero; he was no longer who he used to be.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Arriving at the Morris Villa again, Felix no longer walked hesitantly but strode in, head held high.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Felix here again to pay my respects! I have urgent business with Mr. Morris!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His powerful voice rang out, echoing through the layers of courtyards.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, the gates opened wide.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Two rows of men in suits filed out and lined the path, each one radiating a fierce, intimidating presence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A smirk appeared on Felix's face; to him, these men were like ants on the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then an elderly man, Grayson, with graying hair stepped out, glaring at Felix.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Weren't you supposed to be with Mr. Morris in </span><span>Kingsdon</span><span>? Why are you here making such a racket, disturbing the Morris Villa's peace, and demanding to see the family head? Such arrogance!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Heh..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix sneered. "Barry and Diego won't be coming back! And that woman, Joyce, is probably lying helpless under Alexander right now. Are you sure the family head doesn't want to see me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His tone was dripping with contempt, not even bothering to look at Grayson.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, Grayson's strength was far beneath Diego's.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ever since Felix had become a level-two metahuman, his mindset had completely changed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In this world, power wasn't in wealth or influence. It was in pure, personal strength. Strength ruled all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And so, Felix looked down on anyone weaker than him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grayson was shocked. "Felix, are you serious?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't believe it. Was Alexander really stronger than Barry and Diego?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Especially Diego, one of the top ten experts in the Morris family, far stronger than himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Diego hadn't been from a lesser branch of the Morris Villa, he'd likely hold an elder's position like himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Felix, stop spreading panic! What's your game here? Hand over our people, or I will make you pay!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grayson glared at Felix, radiating a murderous aura.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hahaha, pathetic frog in a well!" Felix laughed mockingly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix laughed up at the sky, completely unfazed by Grayson's threats.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How dare you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The suited men on either side grew furious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had never seen anyone so brazen, daring to cause a scene at the Morris Villa, and were ready to strike.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With just one command from Grayson, they would close in and take down Felix.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix was utterly unfazed and said with a grin, "I rushed back to bring you news about Barry and Diego. Is this really how you show your gratitude?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In his final sentence, Felix projected his voice powerfully, each wave of sound reverberating like a tolling bell.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The men in suits staggered back a few steps, caught in the force of the invisible sound waves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Frost began to form on their faces and bodies, and they shivered from the cold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Incredible! He must be at least a level-three metahuman to wield such terrifying freezing powers!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grayson's face went pale, filled with shock and disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The last time Felix had visited the Morris Villa, he hadn't been so dominant. Had he been hiding his true strength back then?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix smiled in satisfaction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The once-arrogant Morris family now looked at him like they'd seen a ghost, and it felt great.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stepped forward, one pace at a time, advancing on Grayson.</span></p><div class="pagination">
