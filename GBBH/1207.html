  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do I really smell that good?" Alexander chuckled, lifting his arm to take an exaggerated sniff.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brittany snuggled against him, admiring his perfect athletic build, those strong arms and chiseled abs making her heart flutter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as they were walking into the training facility, someone rushed over to greet them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leading the group was a young man whose smile instantly vanished when he saw how cozy Brittany and Alexander were, his expression turning sour.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who do you think you are? Brittany, you should keep your distance from him!" He not only questioned Alexander but had the nerve to lecture Brittany in a condescending tone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's your problem, Gael Jimenez? What gives you the right to stick your nose in my business?" Brittany glared at him. She'd kill him if he made Alexander get the wrong idea.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who's this guy?" Alexander turned to ask Brittany.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She quickly explained, "That's Gael. He's one of the metahumans on this mission... He's been trying to hit on me and won't take no for an answer. God, he's such a pain in the ass. I can't stand him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brittany spoke through gritted teeth, desperately hoping Alexander would put this guy in his place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since Brittany arrived in </span><span>Newbrook</span><span> three days ago, Gael had been sending her flowers daily and hanging around constantly. By now, everyone at the base knew about his relentless pursuit of her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not only that, but he'd been playing the romantic hero, calling her morning and night until she was sick of hearing his voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he wasn't such a key member of the team, Brittany would have blocked his number ages ago.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander couldn't help but chuckle, "This </span><span>guy's</span><span> like a lovesick puppy. It's getting pretty annoying."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now it made sense why Gael had been so rude&mdash;he was one of Brittany's admirers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander didn't mind other men pursuing Brittany. After all, she was an exceptional woman, both in looks and background.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But what Alexander couldn't stand was how Gael's advances were clearly making Brittany uncomfortable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The guys standing behind Gael were all members of the tactical team.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One of them recognized Alexander and quickly whispered in Gael's ear about who he was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>So</span><span> you're the guy who developed that magic powder? I hear you made quite a fortune from it," Gael sneered. "But money doesn't mean you're qualified to join our team. I think you need more training before you're ready for this level."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Gael spoke, he cracked his knuckles and strode toward Alexander with an intimidating swagger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gael was practically seething, looking ready to throw down with Alexander right </span><span>there in front of everyone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Listen here, Alexander," Gael sneered, jabbing his finger at Alexander. "I hear you're pretty good in a fight. Let's settle this&mdash;the winner gets Brittany. You got the guts for that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander gave a casual nod. "Sure. Making an example of you will keep other idiots from bothering my woman."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gael's face turned red with rage at being dismissed so easily. He kicked off the ground with explosive force, vanishing from sight with a sharp whoosh of air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had only been a dozen feet apart, and Gael's speed was absolutely insane. He had to be at least a level-three speed power metahuman. Everyone except Alexander jumped in shock at the terrifying display of power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd watched with wide eyes, certain that Alexander was about to get knocked flat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Most of them were former military who had sparred with Gael before. They respected his abilities and followed his lead because of his proven strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, they were settling in to enjoy the show, convinced Alexander didn't stand a chance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ha! Looks like you were all talk after all!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gael strutted over to </span><span>Alexander,</span><span> a smug grin plastered across his face. He swung his arm back, ready to land a hard slap across Alexander's cheek.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In his mind, he could already hear the satisfying crack of the impact. He'd humiliate Alexander, kick him out of the base, and get rid of his love rival all in one go.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What the hell?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next second, Gael's jaw dropped. His hand had sliced through nothing but air&mdash;Alexander had moved so fast he'd left behind just an afterimage.</span><span> </span></p><div class="pagination">
