  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The hallway was bustling with activity, filled with doctors and nurses rushing past, their expressions cold and indifferent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Billy approached the front desk nurse and, after a brief exchange, led Alexander to a room at the end of the corridor.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He pushed the door open, revealing a scruffy-looking man who turned to face them, his blue eyes filled with suspicion and wariness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">On the hospital bed lay a frail woman, her body emaciated and an oxygen mask covering her face, utterly still.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The only sign of life was the rhythmic beeping of the monitor beside her, indicating she was still hanging on.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander recognized this man as Augusta.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He was a formidable presence, his muscular frame resembling a coiled spring, ready to unleash power at any moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Their eyes locked, and the air crackled with tension, an unspoken challenge passing between them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Augusta was taken aback, thinking, "This guy is strong!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Instinctively, he prepared for a fight, ready to unleash a storm of fury if Alexander made a wrong move.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">That instinctive combat readiness was deeply ingrained in him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander sensed Augusta's tension and smiled slightly; it was clear he was a seasoned leader from the Phantom Squad.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In a one-on-one fight, Alexander would easily outmatch Augusta.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, when it came to a broader skill set&mdash;marksmanship, driving, demolitions, sniping, diving&mdash;Augusta had the edge.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But with the Force at his disposal, Alexander knew that with just a bit of training, he could surpass Augusta in no time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Billy quickly interjected, "Augusta, don't be tense. This is Alexander Hawthorne, the guy I told you about. He's here to help."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Augusta's posture stiffened, surprise washing over him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He hadn't expected this young man to be Billy's boss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander approached the bedside, using the Force to assess the woman's condition.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After a moment, he sighed softly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Unfortunately, her illness was too severe; even with the Force, he could only alleviate her suffering, not cure her completely.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Can you heal her?" Augusta asked, a hint of skepticism in his voice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander replied with a gentle smile, "I can't cure her, but I can help ease her pain and improve her quality of life."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Really? You're not pulling my leg, are you?" Augusta's excitement was palpable as he struggled to his feet, favoring his left leg.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Why would I lie to you? You don't have anything I want," Alexander replied calmly, placing his hands on the woman's body and channeling the Force.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As he concentrated, beads of sweat began to form on his forehead.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The woman, who had been in a deep coma, slowly opened her eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her once-pale complexion began to show a hint of color, a flicker of life returning to her gaze.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She gazed at Alexander with an intense, unwavering look, her demeanor both delicate and sorrowful, exuding a unique, haunting grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Darling, you're finally awake..." Augusta exclaimed, tears streaming down his face as he embraced his wife tightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Have I been asleep for a long time? I'm so sorry for worrying you!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just then, a doctor entered, and upon witnessing the scene, he gasped in disbelief. "My God! You're awake! This is nothing short of a miracle!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Several doctors and nurses rushed in, drawn by the commotion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The hospital had issued multiple death warnings, expecting the woman wouldn't last another few days.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Yet here she was, inexplicably awake and speaking coherently&mdash;an astonishing turn of events.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Augusta realized he had encountered someone extraordinary. He thought, "No wonder this young man is Billy's boss; he is not just anyone."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With heartfelt sincerity, he turned to Alexander and pleaded, "Mr. Hawthorne, can you help my wife regain her health? I'm willing to pay any price!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander gave a wry smile and patted Augusta on the shoulder.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It's not that I don't want to help. It's just that there's only so much I can do. All I can offer is to ease her suffering and help her leave with some dignity."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Augusta fell silent, the weight of the words settling heavily in the room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The woman quickly called Augusta over and whispered something in his ear.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He nodded repeatedly, tears welling up in his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With a sharp salute, he turned to Alexander.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mr. Hawthorne, if you don't mind, I'm offering you my life in return."</p><div class="pagination">
