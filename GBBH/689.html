  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander paused, contemplating for a moment before saying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As long as Felix's strength doesn't exceed level seven, we should be fine."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Heinrich's eyes widened, his breathing quickening with excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shadow, you will assist Alexander from now on. I'm old; it's time for me to step back and leave the field," he sighed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shadow bowed his head deeply in respect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander, intrigued, asked, "Father, where did you get the power elixir that's produced so many metahumans?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Heinrich chuckled, a glint of pride flashing in his gaze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I still have connections within the military. Although the power elixir was developed by the Red Umbrella Group, the military is the biggest beneficiary.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"To get my hands on that batch of elixirs, I spent over a billion dollars. And beyond that, I also managed to secure some of the military's latest combat armor."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was taken aback. "What kind of combat armor?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a hint of mystery, Heinrich replied, "Wearable combat armor. Although it's not a fully perfected model, it doubles the combat capabilities of its wearer."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shadow handed Alexander a file with details.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Once equipped with this combat armor, a user's strength and speed are greatly enhanced. For metahumans, wearing the armor effectively multiplies their battle power."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's brow furrowed. He thought, "Can Felix also have access to such armor? "</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For the first time, he felt a real sense of threat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Heinrich sighed, "Unfortunately, I only managed to get around a dozen units, each costing ten million dollars. I would have bought more, but the entire military has fewer than a hundred units in total."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander then asked, "Does the Red Umbrella Group have any of these?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a triumphant smile, Heinrich shook his head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The fact that I was able to obtain these dozen units took extensive effort. Mainly, a high-ranking figure within the military owed me a personal favor, allowing me to purchase them at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The confidentiality level surrounding this armor is even higher than that of the power elixir. If they could perfect it for mass production, it could significantly enhance everyone's combat power."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing that the Red Umbrella Group didn't have this armor, Alexander felt a surge of relief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Heinrich's eyes gleamed as he looked at Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"From the moment I chose you, Felix ceased to be my son. He has defied me repeatedly and even allied himself with that old fox, Rock. I had no choice but to disown him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I only hope... you won't let me down."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Heinrich sat back down in his wheelchair, which he controlled himself to wheel slowly away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shadow initially moved to follow, but Heinrich gestured for him to stay back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shadow, you stay with Alexander. The future belongs to </span><span>you</span><span> young ones now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander watched his father leave, emotions stirring within him&mdash;a complex mixture of relief, sadness, and a faint sense of regret.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After the banquet, Alexander was accompanied by Rosalia and Charlize.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They wore contrasting lingerie, one in black and the other in white, both kneeling on the bed with their backs arched, awaiting his embrace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander chuckled, admiring the scene as if they were exquisite works of art, letting his hands roam and savor the moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosalia and Charlize's eyes sparkled with mischief as they bit their lips, their allure tempting enough to drive any man wild.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander moved close behind Rosalia, grasping her soft, supple curves, pressing his face against her in utter indulgence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosalia melted under Alexander's skillful touch, her body rendered weak and pliant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Charlize, not to be left out, kissed and caressed Rosalia's pale back, her hands eagerly exploring, teasing, and grasping.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caught in their shared embrace, Rosalia whimpered softly, and her body grew feverishly warm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't... not there... you're both so naughty... ah!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Charlize looked up with a mischievous grin, lips wet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, Alexander launched his full advance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosalia felt as though she were being pierced by a blade, her mind a haze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next morning, at first light. Shadow gathered over a hundred elite fighters to join forces with the Ultimate Alliance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing the sudden addition of so many powerful figures filled everyone with excitement, renewing their confidence for the upcoming assault on the Red Umbrella Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon, a luxury cruise ship disguised as a tourist vessel set sail from the port, carrying Alexander and his followers toward Treasure Island.</span></p><div class="pagination">
