  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a sudden rush, more than a dozen men stormed the stage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their eyes gleamed with excitement as they fixed their gazes on Alexander like a pack of hyenas circling their prey.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What a nice surprise! This is the best music festival ever!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm a boxing instructor. Ms. Rhodes will be mine&mdash;none of you stand a chance!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their excited shouts filled the air, their judgment clouded by greed. Each saw Alexander as nothing more than a stepping stone to success.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed so much easier than grinding away at their regular jobs. In their minds, taking down Alexander was their ticket to becoming Sienna's husband, with wealth and beauty at their fingertips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander shook his head with disdain. These men had completely lost their minds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had witnessed what happened to everyone else who tried to attack him, yet here they were.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Greed had a way of making people foolish, and Sienna's promises had stripped them of all common sense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not one of them stopped to consider the obvious. Even if they succeeded in carrying out Sienna's wishes, they would never earn her favor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sienna was simply manipulating them with empty words. Once they committed their crimes, she would wash her hands of the whole affair, ensuring not a trace of evidence led back to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Assault causing permanent disability was at least ten years in prison. Would Sienna really risk that?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was simple logic that Alexander could see clearly, but these men were blinded by greed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"To hell with that! The woman and the money will be mine!" The burly man bellowed, clenching his fists as he advanced toward Alexander menacingly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The others joined in without hesitation. Some had even pulled out switchblades as they surrounded Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can't believe Sienna would stoop so low&mdash;bullying kids and hiring thugs to do her dirty work."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What a vicious woman!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd grew restless. Most people still had a moral compass and were outraged by the scene unfolding before them, openly voicing their disgust.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Someone </span><span>call</span><span> the police! This is going to get ugly fast!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Many in the audience were concerned for Alexander's safety.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The situation was escalating rapidly as more men rushed the stage. Over twenty of them now crowded the platform, leaving barely any room to move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava held Ashley close behind Alexander, her expression completely calm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She knew these ordinary thugs were no match for Alexander. The more that came at him, the more they would end up on the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With so many backups, Sienna's arrogance returned in full force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She pointed at Alexander, her voice dripping with contempt. "You bastard! Weren't you going to hit me? Come on, then! I dare you!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Did you think you could mess with me? I'm the lady of the Rhodes family. You're dead meat today. I won't just break your legs. I'll end you!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get him! All of you! I'll add another one million dollars to the reward!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The promise of money was all it took. One of the thugs let out a battle cry, grabbed a chair from the stage, and swung it full force at Alexander's head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The stage fell into a dead silence, everyone watching with wide eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The chair connected with Alexander's head with a thunderous crash, splintering on impact.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thug's face lit up with savage triumph, certain that blow would have done serious damage. But his grin froze a second later.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander stood there, still wearing that same slight smile as if he hadn't felt a thing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before the shattered chair pieces could hit the ground, the Force seized them and hurled them towards the brute.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A blood-curdling scream tore from the man's throat as countless wounds opened across his muscular frame. He crashed to the ground, blood gushing from his injuries.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From behind, an attacker managed to drive a knife into Alexander's back&mdash;only for the blade to snap with a sharp crack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The broken pieces ricocheted, piercing through the assailant's body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That sinister man collapsed without so much as a whimper.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, Alexander made his move. With a casual wave of his hand, he unleashed the Force like a tidal wave, crashing into the mob of thugs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They toppled like sailboats caught in a storm, bodies flying in every direction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In mere seconds, Alexander had effortlessly dispatched over twenty men.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The plaza fell into stunned silence. The only sound was the collective held breath of the spectators, their eyes wide with a mixture of excitement and disbelief at the display of power they'd just witnessed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That was incredible!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is he even human?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd stood slack-jawed in amazement, unable to process what they'd just witnessed.</span></p><div class="pagination">
