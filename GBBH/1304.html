  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd fell into an uneasy silence, broken only by the occasional whisper.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cleveland's voice rang out again. "Of course, the people of Dominion Church are all good folk. As per tradition, the top three melon growers will be rewarded with a Verdant Crown Melon."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as he finished speaking, the crowd erupted in excited chatter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That melon is something only nobles and high-ranking officials get to enjoy!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I heard from someone back home that outside the church, just one of these melons is worth a hundred gold coins."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Gold coins? That's nothing! Eating this melon can extend your lifespan and make you stronger. They say Mr. Wheeler himself..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>An old man in linen robes cast a quick glance at Cleveland Wheeler on the stage, then shut his mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmph! That Verdant Crown Melon will be mine!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The atmosphere buzzed with anticipation. Everyone was itching to compete.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander rubbed his chin thoughtfully as he listened to the chatter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He turned to Logan. "Logan, we need to get our hands on that Verdant Crown Melon."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Got it, Alexander! If you say so, it must be the right call," Logan said without hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cleveland seemed pleased with the effect his words had on the crowd. He raised his voice. "Enough talk! Everyone, go collect your emerald hoes and get to work!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that command, the field emptied as people hurried off. Jalen gave Alexander and Logan a respectful nod. "Time for work. I'll see you both after we're done."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, only Alexander and Logan remained in the vast open space.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They hesitated, unsure of their next move when Cleveland and a few servants descended from the platform and strode toward them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From a distance, they hadn't gotten a clear look at Cleveland. Now that he was up close, Alexander felt a jolt of unease.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man stood at least eight feet tall, his broad shoulders and thick waist giving him a formidable presence. Veins bulged on his massive hands, a sign of sheer brute strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You must be the newcomers. I'm Cleveland Wheeler, the overseer here," Cleveland said, his sharp gaze locking onto them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander and Logan quickly bowed. "Mr. Wheeler, sir! We'll work hard, we promise."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Good, good! I could tell right away you two are exceptional. It's rare for newcomers to gain entry into Dominion Church so quickly."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He turned to one of his servants. "Rory, bring them their emerald hoes. From now on, the two plots of land at the foot of the eastern mountain belong to them."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you, Mr. Wheeler!" Alexander and Logan bowed again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cleveland let out a hearty laugh. "I'll be off, then."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he turned back to the manor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One of the servants, a pockmarked young man, stepped forward and handed them each a hoe and a small booklet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm Rory Duffy. About last night... I hope you won't hold it against me," Rory said with a sly smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander recognized him instantly. It was the same servant from the previous night.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He patted Rory's shoulder with a grin. "Forget about it. It was nothing."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rory's smirk widened as he pointed eastward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"See that mountain? Your melon fields are right at its base. Consider yourselves lucky. Those are prime plots. Keep those tools and planting guidelines safe. I won't be joining you. Best of luck getting first place."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he turned and hurried after Cleveland.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Watching them leave, Alexander let out a cold chuckle. He tightened his grip on the emerald hoe, gritting his teeth. "That man is bad news."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had seen plenty of people like Cleveland before. He could tell the man was up to something.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Logan nodded, eyes following Rory's retreating figure. "No way he's being this friendly for no reason. He's definitely scheming something."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander gave Logan a reassuring slap on the back. "We'll play it by ear. Come on, let's check out our fields."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Near the manor gates, Rory's face twisted into a sly grin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Wheeler, those two are finished. No way they'll even learn the Energy-Gathering Technique in three months, let alone grow any melons."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cleveland's expression darkened. "Don't be so sure. Word is, the Head Priest Hezekiah performed a Spiritual Awakening on them. That's something most people can only dream of."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah... a Spiritual Awakening..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rory sighed enviously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cleveland rolled his eyes. "Still, they offended Mr. Wachtell. If it weren't for the Head Priest Hezekiah's interest in them, I would've killed them already. But no matter. I have my ways of getting these two little Risuneses expelled from the church, and once they're out, the authorities can take care of them."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Brilliant! Absolutely brilliant!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rory fawned, his face full of admiration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander and Logan followed a narrow dirt path, making their way toward the eastern mountain. After about six miles, they reached the base of the towering peak. Alexander took one look around and his expression soured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their two plots of land were on the very outskirts of the entire melon field. The soil was hard, covered in coarse sand and gravel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sparse green vines struggled to grow, bearing only a handful of tiny, weak Verdant Crown Melons.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Meanwhile, the other melon fields nearby were flourishing with large, round, healthy fruit.</span></p><div class="pagination">
