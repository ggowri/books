  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander swung the rifle off his back and opened fire on the ten red gorillas charging toward him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With his enhanced senses, he didn't even need to aim. The bullets streaked out like lightning bolts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though they were just assault rifle rounds, his Force powers amplified them to devastating effect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The rapid gunfire was punctuated by several agonized howls.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander had already taken down multiple red gorillas with perfect headshots.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their headless bodies lay scattered on the ground in pools of blood&mdash;a gruesome sight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander maintained a distance of about 250 feet from the gorillas, and their defenses were far weaker than the Mutated Monkey King's skull.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before they could even reach him, he'd already eliminated more than half of them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The combat abilities of an Advanced Warrior went far beyond what ordinary people could imagine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead of meeting the charging gorillas head-on, Alexander kept backing away while picking them off&mdash;like a pro gamer kiting a boss in an MMO.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One by one, his bullets found their marks until all the remaining red gorillas lay dead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The beast tide might have been fierce, but they were no match for Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After dispatching the group of red gorillas, he pushed deeper into the heart of the beast tide.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Any mutated beast that got too close to Alexander ended up dead, their bodies carved into pieces on the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their unnaturally tough bodies continued to twitch and struggle even after death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once Alexander had eliminated all dozen-plus red gorillas, the beast tide's momentum visibly weakened. A large portion of the mutated beasts began to move erratically as if they'd lost their coordination.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A rush of pure exhilaration surged through Alexander's body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just like sex, killing could bring its own kind of thrill, and Alexander was savoring every moment of it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew why these dozens of red gorillas had come for him. The mysterious figure behind them was panicking, afraid Alexander would smoke them out of hiding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, the beast tide split into several groups.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The largest group continued charging toward Louvian Port, while another surrounded Alexander. The final group abruptly turned tail and fled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They seemed to be protecting their mysterious leader, trying to get them safely away from the battlefield.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Alexander wouldn't let them off that easy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He smirked. Victory was within his grasp. All he had to do was chase down and expose this mystery person.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This would not only crush the beast tide but also blow the lid off the Sakra Society's entire conspiracy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the horde split up, the mutant beasts surrounding Alexander were clearly terrified. After watching him slaughter their companions, they just circled him nervously, too afraid to attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those red gorillas' deaths were fresh in their minds, and fear had taken hold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander unleashed the Force, extending his Lightsaber to its full length. He picked up his killing pace and charged after the fleeing group</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Any mutant beast that dared to block </span><span>hi</span><span>s path met a swift end.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Some of the creatures had already started to flee.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The horde surrounding Alexander couldn't slow him down. He picked up speed like a hunter closing in on his prey, keeping them firmly in his sights.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, Alexander caught up to them, cutting through the fleeing mass of beasts like a sharp sword. The mysterious figure at the center began to panic, and chaos spread through the entire horde.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A victorious smile crossed Alexander's face. His hunch had been right. Subduing that mysterious person would end this beast invasion once and for all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, his eyes lit up. With his incredible vision, he spotted ten red-furred gorillas huddled together, apparently shielding someone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander could just barely make out a figure in a black cloak&mdash;the mysterious person he'd been hunting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The figure carried a dark, bulging pack on their back. Whatever was inside remained a </span><span>secret</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander wasn't about to let this troublemaker escape. Today, he would give it everything he had.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You won't get away!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander let out a battle cry and charged forward, swinging his Lightsabers like spinning windmills.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His Lightsabers tore through everything in their path, leaving mutant beasts in pieces and rivers of blood in their wake.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The ten red gorillas suddenly scattered in all directions, abandoning their post.</span></p><div class="pagination">
