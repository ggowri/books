  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From Alexander's perspective, he could see Nancy's full breasts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without a bra, every slight movement caused them to sway enticingly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I heard from Brittany that your massages are amazing. Help me with one too," Nancy said, lying down on the bed and displaying her figure without reservation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her breasts, covered only by a thin layer of fabric, swayed gently, their round bases and perky peaks begging to be touched.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The faint pink hue of her nipples hinted at their natural, untouched allure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I never realized you were such a fool. Why are you just standing there?" Nancy sulked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Alexander approached the bed, Nancy reached into his pants without hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander chuckled, "The leader of the Kaylon is indeed different, decisive, and straightforward."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shut up, or I'll shoot you." Nancy blushed, her fingers playing with the two large balls she found.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, do you really like me?" she asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, I do. You're very charming, and being the leader of the Kaylon is a great help to me," Alexander replied honestly, his hand resting on her ample breasts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy looked at him. "Tell me the truth, how many women do you have?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hehe, I do have many women, but I won't just marry anyone," Alexander said, squeezing her breasts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because Nancy was lying on her side, they appeared even fuller and more enticing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy let out a soft moan. "Will you marry me? Let's date to get married."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smiled, "You know Ava is my girlfriend. You have the right to compete, but I also have the right to choose or not choose you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy glared at him. "Besides Ava and Brittany, who else is there? That slutty Rosalia? I can tell she likes you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smiled, "Love is a two-way street, but physical pleasure is different. It can make both parties happy. Like how you're being so proactive now. Aren't we both enjoying it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't be so full of yourself. I haven't said I'll give myself to you yet." Nancy sulked, slapping his hand away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander grinned and placed his hand back on her breasts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy grabbed his ear and said, "Are you stupid? If you marry me, the Kaylon will be yours."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, I'll try my best," Alexander replied, caressing her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy's breath quickened, her ample breasts heaving even more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She pulled Alexander's head to her chest. "Does it feel good? Is it soft?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's face was buried in her plump breasts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It feels good," he said, opening his mouth to bite and suck on them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy giggled from the ticklish sensation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Have you tasted Brittany's? Are mine or hers better?" she asked, pushing her breasts into his mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander felt a fire burning inside him, Nancy's seductive actions driving him wild.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't answer her question but instead frantically caressed and kissed her body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They kissed and pleased each other, rolling from one end of the bed to the other.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Does it feel good?" Nancy asked, her movements still somewhat awkward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It feels good, but it's not enough just to do this. You need to lick it too." Alexander guided her, and as Nancy's technique improved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He felt even more pleasure, his breath becoming ragged.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Will it still hurt the second time?" Nancy asked with concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander patted her head gently and said softly, "You haven't fully recovered yet. We won't do it today. Let's just hug and kiss."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy was stunned and touched.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A man who could restrain himself in such a situation was truly extraordinary.</span></p><div class="pagination">
