They not only touched and flirted openly, but some had already begun to undress in public.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These men, all dressed in designer brands, looked like wealthy playboys.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The women, willingly or not, were all dressed in revealing, sexy attire with fiery figures.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A few women had stiff expressions, tears on their faces, and even red palm prints, clearly indicating they were coerced.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had no power to resist and could only submit to the men's demands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A woman, her dress torn off, screamed in fear and ran towards Alexander, arms wrapped around her chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander gently supported her, and she couldn't help but wail.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bitch. Where do you think you're going?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Several men chased after her, aggressively trying to drag her away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Please, let me go. I don't want this. No!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The woman struggled desperately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander bellowed, silencing everyone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you even men, bullying a woman like this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone was stunned for a few seconds before bursting into laughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A man with red hair contemptuously glared at Alexander, even poking him hard in the chest with his finger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who are you to meddle in my business?" Bradley Patel taunted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Patel, I don't know this guy. Do you know him? Some nobody, looking for trouble!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He probably snuck in. If Mr. Vanderbilt knew, he'd be dead already."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The others laughed at Alexander, mocking him, not taking him seriously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander slapped Bradley.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bradley flew like a cannonball, crashing into the wall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The impact was so great that the entire room shook.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bradley spat out a mouthful of blood and fell to the ground, unmoving, his condition uncertain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instantly, a deathly silence fell, everyone staring in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Boy, how dare you commit violence here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A tall and burly middle-aged man jumped up, rushing towards Bradley in a frenzy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In fact, Alexander had noticed him as soon as he entered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This middle-aged man was the strongest present, with a subtle murderous aura in his eyes, indicating he was a killer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had been sitting silently in the corner of the sofa, drinking, looking out of place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately for him, he encountered Alexander. Alexander's strength was far beyond his reach.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Patel, are you okay? Wake up!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man shook Bradley anxiously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bradley finally opened his eyes, his face filled with resentment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Brent, you're our family's top fighter. Don't just stand there. Kill him... kill him!!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As you wish, Mr. Patel!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brent charged at Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He quickly threw a punch, smashing towards Alexander's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander advanced instead of retreating, stepping forward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed like a simple step forward, but his speed was unimaginably fast, several times faster than Brent, who had started first.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, before Brent could react, Alexander punched him in the stomach.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brent flew like a cannonball, smashing into the wall, then crashed to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, even the solid wall was covered in a dense network of cracks, like a giant spider's web.</span></p><div class="pagination">
