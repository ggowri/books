  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ella had no idea danger was looming as she walked into the office, lost in thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All the other teachers had already gone home, leaving her alone in the preschool.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A dark figure followed closely, like a snake ready to strike.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once Ella left the office, the shadowy figure poured a liquid into her cup.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Ella drank from that cup tomorrow, she'd undoubtedly consume the potion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The figure smirked darkly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Heh </span><span>heh</span><span>, Mr. Vanderbilt is determined. Not only is he after Jane, but he won't spare this teacher, either. That brat, Ashley, won't escape for long!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His goal was to poison Ella so that once she was hooked, he could control her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ella was Ashley's teacher; controlling her would give him plenty of opportunities to target Ashley.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Daddy! Daddy!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as Ashley got home, she ran into Alexander's arms, begging for attention.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The little girl looked up at him with a sweet smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at the adorable little angel, Alexander felt his heart melting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He pinched his daughter's nose with a smile, saying, "Hey, little piggy, you're back! Were you good at school today?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm not a little piggy; you're the big piggy, Daddy! I was really good, and Ms. Purnell likes me best!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ashley giggled and tried to pinch Alexander's nose back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she couldn't reach his nose, so her soft little hands playfully grabbed and squeezed his face instead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander laughed heartily, happier than he'd been in a long time, as he held his daughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava watched them with a warm smile, sensing the strong father-daughter bond.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her heart felt warm and full; this was what family felt like.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava suggested, "Since we're off tomorrow, why don't we go to the water park?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yay! I love the water park! That's awesome. I want to </span><span>go,</span><span> I want to go!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ashley jumped up, clapping her hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander agreed right away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ding-dong! Ding-dong!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, the doorbell rang.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander checked the security monitor and frowned. It was Andrew and Belinda.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava asked in confusion, "What are they doing here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander opened the door without a word.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What do you want?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Andrew scowled and said, "I'm here to take Ashley out. I'm her grandpa, and I have the right."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander grew more suspicious; this old man showing up out of the blue to take Ashley had to be up to something.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't want to </span><span>go,</span><span> I don't want to..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ashley muttered, frightened, and hid in Ava's arms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Andrew was about to lose his temper, but Belinda held him back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Belinda smiled sweetly at Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We're Ashley's grandparents and just want to take our granddaughter out for some family time. Is that a problem?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander thought it over for a moment, then refused.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sorry, Ashley doesn't want to go. Maybe you can come another time."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Belinda's expression changed immediately, and she started yelling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn you, Alexander! How dare you keep us from seeing Ashley? This is illegal!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Andrew jumped up, absolutely furious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, if you don't hand over Ashley today, we're not done here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their uproar only made Alexander more suspicious; there was no way he was letting them take Ashley.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What law am I breaking? I'm the one with legal custody of Ashley. I'm her guardian, not you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's words left Andrew speechless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Belinda snorted, sneering sarcastically, "Fine, you won't let us take her? We'll have Jane come instead. She's Ashley's mother; surely you won't refuse her?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander didn't respond. Legally, he couldn't prevent Jane from taking Ashley out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just wait. You wouldn't dare keep Ashley from her mother!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Belinda's face lit up smugly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Andrew pointed at Alexander's nose and cursed, "You punk, just wait and see if we can take her or not!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two of them stormed off, seething with anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ashley trembled in fear, stammering, "I'm scared... I don't want to go..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander gently stroked his daughter's head and reassured her, "Don't worry, I won't let anyone hurt you!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
