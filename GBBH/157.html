  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A few security guards eyed Alexander with ill intent, skepticism written all over their faces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>None of them could accept that this ordinary-looking guy could possibly be a resident&mdash;especially since he didn't even have a car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had already reported his identity to their supervisor and were now waiting for a response.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moments later, </span><span>Ottilio</span><span> Sinclair, the manager of Grand Hyatt Estates, came rushing up, visibly out of breath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Sinclair, what brings you here personally?" one of the guards stammered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The head guard felt a knot tighten in his stomach. He thought, "This guy's really a trouble! Otherwise, Mr. Sinclair wouldn't have come personally!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Surround him&mdash;don't let him get away!" the head guard barked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Several others moved in, some brandishing tasers while others had their hands resting on their holsters.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander stood his ground, unfazed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ottilio</span><span> shouted as he sprinted over, delivering a swift kick to the leading guard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop! You all back off! Can't you see this guy's a respectable owner? Ready to throw away your jobs?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The security team froze in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get out of the way! This is Mr. Hawthorne, the most esteemed resident at Grand Hyatt Estates," </span><span>Ottilio</span><span> scolded, his voice laced with authority.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amid the shocked, fearful glares of the guards, </span><span>Ottilio</span><span> ushered Alexander inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander didn't give the fiasco a second thought; to him, those guards were no more significant than ants.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Xavier had taken the stunning Jennifer Minogue back to his place. The moment they stepped through the door, they wasted no time getting cozy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In seconds, Xavier had Jennifer wrapped in his arms, their lips moving wildly together. Clothes were shed, and soon, they were entangled on the floor in a passionate heap.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just a few minutes later, Xavier pulled back, still breathless, and the two cuddled up, chatting away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Darling, do you know that guy from earlier?" Jennifer asked softly, her eyes sparkling with curiosity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Xavier gave a mischievous grin, puffing up with pride.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He's just a high school classmate of mine&mdash;total loser. I just had to mess with him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jennifer giggled. "Mr. Ulysses, you're such a bad boy!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That guy really cracked me up thinking he could claim to be a resident here. With how he dressed, he'd fit right in as the janitor!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Xavier roared with laughter, relishing his moment of superiority.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Speaking of which, I heard there's a billion-dollar mansion around here&mdash;something called the Grand Hyatt Estates' Majestic Manor. Is that true?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jennifer's eyes sparkled with envy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The villas at Grand Hyatt Estates had been categorized into three tiers: high, medium, and low. The Ulysses family's villa had fallen into the lower mid-range, valued at tens of millions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The high-end villas had, on the other hand, started in the hundreds of millions. Among them, the crown jewel had been a mansion known as "Grand Hyatt Estates' Majestic Manor," worth one billion dollars. This property had been an asset of the Saint Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Xavier's expression shifted slightly. His family's villa was nowhere near that level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sure, the Grand Hyatt Estates' Majestic Manor exists, but a billion dollars is pure folly. Who in their right mind would buy that?" he scoffed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Ulysses, I'd love to see the Grand Hyatt Estates' Majestic Manor. Could you take me?" Jennifer </span><span>begged,</span><span> eyes wide with eagerness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's so special about it? It's just a house; how good can it really be?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Xavier frowned, reluctant to agree.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The truth was he couldn't take her there. Grand Hyatt Estates had rules against trespassing into private territories.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Grand Hyatt Estates' Majestic Manor was perched on the mountain, taking up half the picturesque hill that surrounded the estate. That area was strictly off-limits.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were harsh penalties for invading private property, including being shot on sight by patrols.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Security at Grand Hyatt Estates was split into outer and inner circles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The outer circle of security was made up of regular guards, the kind Xavier could easily boss around.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the inner circle? That was a different story. Comprised of retired military personnel and mercenaries, they were heavily armed and didn't hesitate to use their firepower.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The owner of the Grand Hyatt Estates' Majestic Manor was someone far beyond Xavier's reach.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he crossed the line, it could spell disaster for the entire Ulysses family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come on, Mr. Ulysses! I just want to broaden my horizons a little.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Take me to see it, will you? I promise I'll make it worth your while. Whatever you want, I'll be all yours when we get back," Jennifer purred, snuggling closer to Xavier and batting her lashes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her playful promise sent a thrill through him, and he felt his resolve start to crumble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Xavier mused, "Well, I've heard that the Grand Hyatt Estates' Majestic Manor has been empty for ages. Maybe it wouldn't hurt to take a peek. Plus, it could score me some serious points with Jennifer."</span></p><div class="pagination">
