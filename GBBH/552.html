If you are competent, cure Ms. Elaina Gomez!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander sneered, "I knew you would say that. We made a bet just now. If I cure Ms. Elaina Gomez, you must apologize, get out of </span><span>Kingsdon</span><span>, and never see Nancy again!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clay snorted contemptuously, "Well, go ahead!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Orlando came back to his senses and pushed him away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get out of here, you jerk!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, Orlando apologized sincerely to Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I was blind and trusted Clay. Please forgive me and rescue my daughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As long as you can save her life, I will definitely give you the dragon bone fragment!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Orlando was forced into a desperate situation and could only try every possible way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander agreed without hesitation, "Okay. Ms. Elaina Gomez can still be saved. Leave it to me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Orlando shuddered and burst into tears with excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clay mocked, "If you can cure her, I will apologize to you immediately!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Orlando yelled, "Shut up! I now suspect you are a liar. If my daughter can't recover, I will kill you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He glared at Clay with a ferocious expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone gazed at him with suspicion, contempt, and disdain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clay's face turned livid, and he didn't know how to explain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't tell them that he was the one behind the witchcraft in Elaina's body and that no one else could remove it, but he also couldn't explain why this was the case.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Alexander came to the bedside, Elaina's body had turned black and purple, like a stiff corpse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone stared at Alexander intently with wide eyes, wondering what he would do to bring a dead person back to life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander put his right hand on Elaina's breast and rubbed it in front of everyone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, streams of the Force penetrated into her body, completely eliminating the evil energy within her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander also pressed his left hand there and continued to massage Elaina's plump breasts with both hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone showed their displeasure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clay cursed loudly, "So you are a pervert, deliberately taking advantage of Ms. Elaina Gomez."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Orlando's face darkened extremely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elaina wasn't rescued, and Alexander even touched her breasts and took advantage of her in public. Orlando thought if this were to get out, he would be a joke.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Completely ignoring everyone's shock and contempt, Alexander slapped and rubbed Elaina's plump breasts hard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wisps of heat rose within her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her originally dark skin slowly began to turn purple, then pale, and finally rosy.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone gazed at the scene without blinking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every time Alexander rubbed, a wisp of the Force merged into Elaina's body, causing the black energy to diminish.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all the black energy disappeared, he said to Orlando, "She's cured. She is fine."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Elaina remained motionless in her hospital bed with her eyes closed.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Orlando's excitement turned into despair and anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, the heartbeat signal on the ECG monitor changed from a straight line to a faint curve.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, as time went on, the heartbeat became stronger and stronger, and the curve became larger and stable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone subconsciously glanced at other monitoring devices. Whether it was blood pressure or other vital signs, they were all recovering rapidly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Was she reborn? Was she really reborn?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was a dead silence, and everyone stared at Alexander in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clay was as embarrassed as if he had been force-fed a pile of shit in public.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elaina suddenly opened her eyes and looked around curiously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elaina! Elaina, are you really awake?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Orlando was extremely thrilled. He rushed forward and held Elaina's hand tightly, tears streaming down his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dad, am I not dead?" she asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elaina, you are not dead. Of course, you are not dead. You have been rescued. God bless you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Orlando was so overjoyed that he was incoherent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was an uproar in the room. Everyone burst into discussion and fixed their eyes on Alexander with shock and admiration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If they hadn't seen it with their own eyes, it would have been hard to believe that he had brought Elaina back to life.</span></p><div class="pagination">
