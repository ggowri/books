You will officially become a partner of the Saint Group, and I'll offer you a ten percent discount."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you, Miss Rowe. I really appreciate your support," Burton Mansfield replied, nodding eagerly, overly accommodating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Burton was polite to Alexander, Alexander couldn't help but notice the occasional flicker of disdain in the man's eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander didn't mind. In many people's eyes, he was just Betty's kept man, especially since the magic powder formula came from her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After concluding the business deal, they toasted one more time before Burton excused himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander wrapped an arm around Betty and began to move his body to the rhythm of the music.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Betty had a unique scent that thrilled him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was rare for Betty to come to a bar with him, and she was clearly enjoying herself, her sultry dance moving in sync with the music.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not far away, a few men exchanged lewd glances and deliberately squeezed closer to Betty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The leader was a rotund man, his belly protruding like that of a pregnant woman, his jiggling cheeks wobbling as he moved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander had already noticed these unsavory characters, his expression quickly turning cold as a dangerous glint flashed in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man and his companions circled Betty, occasionally brushing against her before grinning as they stepped away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Betty had been drinking, she was very much alert and felt the harassment, quickly backing away toward Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The rotund man, undeterred, continued to invade her space, and Betty's temper flared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Slap!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a swift motion, she slapped the man hard across the face, making him dizzy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man clutched his stinging cheek, realizing he had failed to take advantage and had been humiliated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fuck!

You think you can play tough? You don't even know who my boss is! I'm going to make you pay!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man was defiant, believing he had been ambushed, and picked up a bottle to charge at Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The bottle whizzed through the air, but Alexander casually punched the man in the face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A piercing scream echoed throughout the bar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man fell to the ground, blood gushing from his face, showcasing the severity of Alexander's blow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You little brat, you dare to hit Albert? You're asking for death!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man's cronies snapped back to reality, drawing sharp daggers and rushing toward Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sharp dagger slashed towards Alexander's throat with extreme viciousness.</span></p><div class="pagination">
