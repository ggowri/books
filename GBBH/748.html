  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander chuckled and said, "The woman I like must not only be beautiful but also have a sexy figure."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melin was so embarrassed that she couldn't even lift her head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander took off her uniform, followed by a large-sized bra.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her full breasts were released, quivering and bouncing continuously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander grabbed one with his hand; it was heavy and very elastic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Baby, look, they're big and perky, not sagging at all, really beautiful!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He kissed it, like an infant cradled in its mother's arms, sucking greedily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh... Wait a moment... Let me go to the restroom first!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melin struggled to get up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She knew how much stimulation Alexander would bring her, and she didn't want to end up with urinary incontinence; that would be too embarrassing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander watched as Melin ran into the restroom, her buttocks swaying, his desire burning intensely, but he forced himself to hold back; the best was yet to come.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melin came out after spending some time in the restroom, her body carrying the scent of body wash, indicating that she had just taken a shower.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She lowered her head, feeling embarrassed as she slowly walked up to Alexander, took his hand, and gently shook it. "Be gentle later, I'm afraid others might hear us."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander stood up with a smile, wrapped his arm around her slender waist, pulled her close, and began to kiss her passionately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, his hands were squeezing and kneading her smooth, delicate buttocks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry, there's no one outside. Even if you scream as loud as you want, it's fine."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmm... It's so itchy down there..." she said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melin wrapped one arm around Alexander's neck, while the other hand moved downward, rubbing Alexander's penis through his pants.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander patted her bottom. Melin immediately understood and obediently knelt by the bed, sticking out her plump, round buttocks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What a slut, no wonder Blaze wants to rape you!" he said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop talking about him..." Melin begged with a flushy face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander touched her moist intimate area and exclaimed, "Why are you so excited when talking about Blaze? Do you want him to rape you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No! I don't..." Melin denied it shyly with her numb body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander stopped teasing her and thrust into her body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melin lay on the edge of the bed, her hands reaching back to grasp Alexander's arms, letting out a series of soft, breathy moans.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can't... I really can't, slower... &#8203;Ah... I love you so much..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander, enjoying her body, instead increased his pace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melin felt like she was going crazy, gripping the sheets tightly and desperately pushing her hips back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander felt the Force within him growing, becoming even more excited, and he thrust deeply, rotating and stirring.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melin had fallen into a semi-conscious state, her breathing becoming increasingly rapid, her face growing redder, and her cries getting louder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even with the ward door tightly shut, the moans still echoed through the empty corridor...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Within three days, the plague in Loscity was completely quelled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But this disaster cost Loscity the lives of tens of thousands. If not for Alexander's antidote, the entire city might have been wiped out, and the plague could have spread, turning into a global catastrophe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander asked Anderson to block the media from reporting the news about him eliminating the plague.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Therefore, most people did not know that Alexander had developed the antidote.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Alexander's reputation in Loscity soared to unprecedented heights. All the influential figures in Loscity knew that it was Alexander who resolved the plague, and </span><span>their respect for the Ultimate Alliance grew even more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this very moment, deep within a secret underground base of the Sakra Society.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a luxurious office, Elaine, dressed in a seductively flamboyant manner, was reporting her research findings to Yinson.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. White, all the samples have died, but we've gained enough results. As long as we integrate the genetic modification technology of the power elixir, we are not far from achieving immortality."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yinson listened with great concentration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Sakra Society was not only the largest criminal organization in Risun, but it also secretly researched biochemical technologies that could achieve immortality.</span></p><div class="pagination">
