  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By around 10 a.m. the next day, Alexander finally left Ava's house, feeling completely refreshed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though Ava's period wasn't over, the two had explored every way to be close except for that final step.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Having a beautiful woman pleasing him left Alexander feeling incredibly satisfied and full of pride.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he arrived back at his Beverly Hills residence, he immediately noticed a familiar black sedan parked at the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Standing nearby were Andrew, Belinda, and Jane.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All three looked pale, with dark circles under their eyes, as if they hadn't slept at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, sorry to bother you again!" As soon as Alexander entered, Andrew rushed over, nodding and bowing with unprecedented humility and respect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What are you doing here again?" Alexander's tone was ice cold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We're here to sincerely apologize. Please, for the five years you were with Jane and for Ashley's sake, can you help us? If not, the Fairfax family will go bankrupt."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Andrew broke down, tears and snot running down his face as he pleaded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a desperate attempt to raise the 40 million, he'd mortgaged nearly everything the Fairfax family owned, only to be swindled out of it all by Jackson.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If they couldn't pay by month's end, bankruptcy was inevitable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander ignored him and headed for the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, Andrew and Belinda both took Alexander's arms and started crying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, we're sorry. We mistreated you. We were terrible people, blinded by prejudice. Please, forgive me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Andrew pleaded while repeatedly slapping himself hard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Belinda kept apologizing, her former arrogance nowhere in sight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane stood there in silence, looking uncomfortable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Andrew urged his daughter. "Jane, you're Ashley's mother&mdash;beg Alexander. He won't stand by and let Ashley's grandfather go bankrupt."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane hesitated, conflicted. After a long pause, she finally lowered her head deeply.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, I'm sorry. Please, help us..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She felt deeply humiliated and full of regret, but the looming threat of bankruptcy forced her to beg Alexander once more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Andrew quickly added. "Alexander, could we at least get a basic distributor role for your magic powder? Just enough to keep us afloat."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander looked at his fawning ex-father-in-law, then glanced at the tearful Jane, feeling both satisfaction and an inexplicable complexity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Fairfax family's downfall was the result of their own greed and lack of integrity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it weren't for Ashley, he would have slapped them even harder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander responded coldly, "Forget about being distributors. For Ashley's sake, I'll track down Jackson. He's not getting away with impersonating me and stealing money."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Alexander stepped into his villa, slamming the door shut.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Andrew and Belinda dared not stop him and could only wail.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane's face turned from pale to red, unsure what to think.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Watching her from the window, Alexander thought Jane wasn't worth any sympathy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She'd provoked him multiple times, and although he'd let it slide for Ashley's sake, he didn't forgive her entirely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander began planning his next moves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had Betty rename Wolf Gang to the Ultimate Alliance, not out of impulse, but to build a force he could fully control.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the magic powder as a foundation, he now had some major tasks lined up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>First, have Betty expand the Ultimate Alliance and establish its headquarters in </span><span>Loscity</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Second, gather materials to forge Lightsabers successfully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The gemstone auction Oscar mentioned was only a week away, so he'd need </span><span>to get </span><span>enough </span><span>money</span><span> ready by then.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Third, capture Sebastian and </span><span>make him</span><span> </span><span>tell where</span><span> Guzman</span><span> was</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for finding Jackson, Alexander wasn't concerned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Back at Astral Bistro, Alexander had left a Force mark on Jackson without him knowing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could still sense the general direction of the mark, indicating Jackson hadn't gone too far from </span><span>Loscity</span><span> and was hiding somewhere nearby.</span></p><div class="pagination">
