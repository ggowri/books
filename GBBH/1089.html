  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The room was in a mess, and Alvin and Maxine were gone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"It must be Silver Shield Security."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A murderous look flashed across Alexander's eyes, and he took Emma straight to the headquarters of Silver Shield Security.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the car, Alexander called Quentin and used the military's information network to quickly locate Jordan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jordan was in an upscale community in the western suburbs of Newbrook. He had a luxurious villa covering an area of ten thousand square feet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The villa had not only a garden and a swimming pool but also extremely strict security.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Security guards patrolled the gate around the clock, and there were the most advanced surveillance cameras, facial recognition, and laser scanning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With such strict security measures, it would take a lot of effort to break in, let alone sneak in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But for Alexander, it was a piece of cake.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was late at night. Alexander parked the car in a secluded grove and told Emma to stay in the car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Be careful!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Emma hugged Alexander tightly, reluctant to let go.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander smiled and touched her breasts, opening the car door and disappearing into the night like a ghost.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Emma quickly closed the car door and turned off the lights, waiting quietly while praying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the deep darkness, Alexander dodged the security guards and the infrared surveillance cameras like a gust of wind and sneaked into the villa without being noticed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He sensed Jordan's presence on the second floor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander went upstairs quietly and saw through the wall with his X-ray vision. Jordan was sleeping like a log in a luxuriously decorated room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>There were two naked young women lying beside him. Evidently, the three of them had a passionate time and exhausted themselves, so they were sleeping soundly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander snorted coldly and looked at the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He saw a secret infrared alarm device installed on the door. As long as Alexander appeared at the door, the alarm would go off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Normally, ordinary people were not able to detect this kind of secret alarm device at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander was a high-level Warrior, and his perception was far more acute than that of ordinary people.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before Alexander reached the door, he raised his hand and pointed at the alarming device.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The invisible Force destroyed it like a bullet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander turned the doorknob.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Crack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The sturdy lock was snapped off, and the door opened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Who is it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jordan woke up suddenly and sat up in fright, looking at Alexander in a daze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Where are Alvin and Maxine?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander appeared in front of Jordan like the wind and looked at him coldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When the two women were about to scream, Alexander slapped them on the head like a bolt of lightning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The two women rolled their eyes and fell down, motionless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You. What do you want? I warn you. I have more than 30 bodyguards here. You can't escape."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jordan threatened Alexander with feigned confidence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander sneered and grabbed Jordan's throat, tightening his grip.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ah! Help. Help..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jordan wanted to call for help, but he could hardly make any sound.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Due to the acute lack of oxygen, his face turned ashen, and his limbs were wriggling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>No matter how he struggled, he couldn't get Alexander to release him. Instead, he felt the grip on his neck tightening.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jordan made gurgling sounds and rolled his eyes. He was about to be strangled to death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Plop."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander threw Jordan to the ground like throwing away garbage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jordan covered his neck and panted heavily for the hard-earned air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander looked down at him and asked coldly, "Tell me. Where are Alvin and Maxine?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The muscles on Jordan's face twitched a few times, and he suddenly reached under the pillow and yelled, "Help! Help!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before he could finish shouting, Alexander grabbed his neck again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Don't kill me. No. Don't."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jordan couldn't breathe, and his face quickly turned black. He rolled his eyes and struggled in vain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'll tell you. I'll tell you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander loosened his grip, and Jordan collapsed to the ground, almost wetting his pants out of fright.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I don't want to die. Please don't kill me. In fact, I was forced to do this. My father ordered me to do this. I am the chairman in name, and my father is the largest shareholder of Silver Shield Security."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Alvin and Maxine were sent to my dad. Please. Don't kill me. Don't kill me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jordan knelt to Alexander, knowing his life was in Alexander's hands.</span></p><div class="pagination">
