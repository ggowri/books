The air itself seemed to thicken, pressing down on him with an almost physical weight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a flash, Shadow and the others watched as a black figure materialized behind Alexander like a phantom, its hand shooting out to grab his throat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though they stood hundreds of feet away from Alexander, everyone felt the violent ripple in space.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Faced with that horrifying black hand, no one could move. It was like being trapped in quicksand with tons of weight pressing down on them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Felix has made his move!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shadow's face went pale as he stared at the black hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill them!!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Red Umbrella Group's captives erupted in excited cheers at the sight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Finally, we're saved!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their voices rang out with triumph. "Victory will be ours! Treasure Island belongs to us!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their excitement was through the roof, pinning all their hopes on Felix.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander maintained a calm expression as he faced the giant black hand reaching for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He muttered under his breath, "Borrowed power is always just borrowed. Still, this evil Force is impressive. Clearly, there's a lot in this world I've yet to discover..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His voice brimmed with confidence as he added, "If this isn't even the true evil entity, what harm can it do to me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>BOOM!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The black hand lunged at Alexander but crashed against an invisible Force shield, unable to break through.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite his outward composure, Alexander's heart raced as he faced this unprecedented challenger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a flash, his Lightsaber ignited and wreathed in flames as the Force surged through it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The heat was so intense that Shadow and the others could feel it burning from hundreds of feet away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Evil will always be evil!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander gripped his Lightsaber, and his entire presence transformed dramatically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thrust his blade straight into the center of the black hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For a moment, the hand and Lightsaber were locked in a standoff. Then, the hand </span><span>began to crumble, disintegrating piece by piece until it vanished entirely in the pale flames.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gripping his Lightsaber with both hands, Alexander channeled every ounce of Force power he had and brought his blade crashing down toward Felix's head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Alexander's first time unleashing his full power. The Force stored within him burst forth like a flood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His level-two Lightsaber reached its maximum potential, blazing so bright it could blind anyone who dared look directly at it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Among the thousand people surrounding the plaza, most couldn't bear to look. Many felt their knees buckle, dropping to the ground with a thud.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's strike destroyed Felix's hand, while the Force engulfed Felix's body in searing flames that crackled and hissed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill him! Kill him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix's rage exploded as dark energy surged outward, extinguishing all the flames.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander struck relentlessly, his sword darting like lightning toward Felix.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix roared continuously, charging like an enraged bull, using his dark powers to defend himself while viciously ramming toward Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>BOOM!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two terrifying forces collided violently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Lightsaber wrapped in intense flames clashed against the dark energy. They compressed, devoured, and destroyed each other like water meeting fire, incompatible and locked in eternal conflict.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The entire plaza trembled as invisible ripples spread outward in concentric circles like stones dropped in still water.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, a piercing scream echoed from the plaza's center as the dark energy rapidly dispersed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix's furious voice rang out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kid, I won't forget this! You'll die by my hand eventually. When I truly enter this world, I'll skin you alive!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As his words faded, Felix crashed heavily to the ground, his body shattering into pieces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander wiped the blood from the corner of his mouth and gave a bitter smile. Though he'd killed Felix, he hadn't escaped unscathed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Against such supernatural evil, his power still fell far short.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Red Umbrella Group's captives were struck speechless with fear. With Felix dead, their only options were surrender or death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cloe moved in with her team, securing all the prisoners.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone looked at Alexander with complex expressions mixing excitement, awe, and deep anticipation for the future.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A thunderous roar filled the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sound of helicopter blades grew louder as they approached.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A black helicopter swooped in, landing swiftly in the plaza.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Shadow quickly straightened his clothes and said excitedly, "Mr. Hawthorne, the Godfather's here.
