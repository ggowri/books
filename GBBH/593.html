  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought Alexander had underestimated the enemy and would get hurt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Almost everyone thought that Alexander was going to lose. If his skin was scratched even a little by Patrick's nails, the poison would make his life a living hell.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A series of shattering sounds were heard. And black nail fragments flew everywhere.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Patrick covered his right hand and screamed. All the bones in his right fingers were broken and comminuted. His right hand was disabled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander looked at his fist and found it was unharmed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said, "Patrick, are you invulnerable to swords and guns? Why are you so weak?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bastard! What kind of power is this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Patrick cursed bitterly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His body was as strong as steel and invulnerable to swords and guns, but Alexander broke one of his hands with one punch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I want to see if the rest of your body is harder."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Speaking, Alexander kicked Patrick in the chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The speed was so fast that Patrick was unable to react. He flew backwards and fell heavily to the ground, vomiting blood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone was scared, and their legs trembled uncontrollably.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Patrick fell to the ground and fainted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is this the witch? It seems to be not that great."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander looked disdainful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone was stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They stared at Alexander in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander looked at them with a smile. "None of you can leave."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Run!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Some people turned around and ran. Ignoring Clay and Patrick, they fled frantically in all directions like frightened rabbits.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You can't get away."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smiled contemptuously and instantly appeared behind a runner.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man let out a shrill howl and fell heavily to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Others were even more frightened and fled desperately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander attacked repeatedly. And soon, all the people, including Clay, turned into flames and disappeared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Entering the hotel, Alexander went to see Ashley first.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ashley was taking a nap and sleeping soundly. He smiled with satisfaction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Ashley was out of danger, Alexander could return to Loscity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But since Alexander had come to Kingsdon, he must kill Felix.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He once swore in front of Ashley that he would become the Godfather's only heir.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Where's Rosalia?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander frowned. Rosalia had always been conscientious and responsible. She should be here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, Alexander heard a panicked cry coming from the next room. It was Rosalia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What happened?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander quickly went to the next room and kicked the door open.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosalia leaned back on the sofa and was covered in cold sweat, panting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She said, "Master, I seem to be poisoned!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Poisoned? Let me see."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander quickly examined Rosalia's body. And with his All-seeing Eyes he discovered that there was indeed poison in her body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He guessed she wasn't the only one poisoned in the hotel. No wonder he didn't see many people just now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ashley had taken the Kaylon Pill. Her body became highly resistant to toxicity and could even decompose toxins on its own.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It must be Clay and his gang's doing!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fortunately, Alexander was able to cure it. Otherwise, Rosalia would die.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosalia closed her eyes tightly. She became weaker and weaker, and her face became paler.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander quickly used the Force to treat Rosalia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In particular, Rosalia's plump breasts were the main target of massage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Alexander massaged and pinched her breasts, he couldn't help but become excited.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her breasts were soft and bouncy. And they felt great.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Alexander's timely treatment, Rosalia finally woke up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Master, I... I'm not dead?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She vaguely recognized it as Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smiled, "I would not let you die."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosalia looked down at her chest. Her bra had been unhooked, exposing her body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She blushed and said shyly, "Did you touch me just now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander couldn't help but chuckle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosalia licked her lips coquettishly, trying to seduce him.</span></p><div class="pagination">
