  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Rhodes Monroe, just you wait. If I, Alexander, survive today, I will avenge this!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander pulled out a bottle of&nbsp;Docpirin&nbsp;from his robe and downed the last two pills in one go. With a slight push off his toes, he shot up onto the stage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Below the stage,&nbsp;Julius&nbsp;twisted his face into a savage grin and burst into laughter. "Hahaha! He's done for!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rhodes smiled at Alexander and clapped his hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, you're truly a young hero. I admire you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's eyes burned with fury, while Rhodes' smile looked as sinister as a snake's.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His expression remained icy as he silently gathered all of&nbsp;the Force within him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Relax! Since you're only a&nbsp;level-three warrior, I won't take advantage of you. I won't use&nbsp;Dragon Sword!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Playing the part of a gracious opponent, Rhodes tossed&nbsp;Dragon&nbsp;Sword aside, letting it land far away on the stage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Throwing away your sword doesn't mean you're no longer a&nbsp;level-four warrior!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Below the stage,&nbsp;Logan&nbsp;shouted, drawing everyone's attention.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rhodes' face flickered with anger and embarrassment. He was about to end Alexander in a single move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, a middle-aged priest leaped onto the stage. Alexander and Rhodes quickly bowed in respect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The priest returned the gesture and said, "By decree, I have come to question Rhodes Monroe!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rhodes immediately straightened up, bowed, and said respectfully, "I am ready to listen!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Rhodes Monroe, when did you enter the&nbsp;Outer Court?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I have been in the&nbsp;Outer Court&nbsp;for eleven years."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Very well. You have been in the&nbsp;Outer Court&nbsp;for eleven years, while Alexander has only been here for six months.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Rhodes Monroe, what is your current level in martial arts?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I am a&nbsp;level-four warrior, at the peak of my mastery. I have already comprehended the true essence of martial arts."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The priest nodded in admiration. "Impressive! Rhodes Monroe, you truly are a martial arts prodigy!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, Rhodes trembled slightly, overwhelmed with excitement!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The priest turned to Alexander. "Alexander, what is your current level?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander respectfully answered, "I am a&nbsp;level-three warrior, at the peak of my mastery."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The priest fixed Rhodes with a sharp gaze. "Rhodes Monroe, can you win against Alexander in a sparring match?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rhodes' face turned red, his chest rising and falling rapidly. He lowered his head. "I... I can win the match..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, Rhodes hesitated. He had already accepted the gold and the estate. He couldn't return them now. He needed them too much...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gritting his teeth, he bowed deeply. "I... I will limit our match to ten moves!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The priest was silent for a moment, then nodded slightly. "Very well. A fellow disciple may issue a challenge, so ten moves it is." With that, he left the stage and walked toward the judges' platform.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rhodes burned with rage. This Alexander had caused the master to indirectly reprimand him. He would make him pay for that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Trying to appear magnanimous, Rhodes shouted, "Alexander and I hit it off instantly, so our match will be limited to ten moves!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smirked inwardly.&nbsp;"Ten moves, huh?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Did he think I am made of paper? With my golden energy, my muscles and bones are as strong as steel. I won't end up paralyzed like I was against Arturo."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes flickered as he took a step forward and cupped his hands toward Rhodes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Since you think so highly of me, why don't we add a little wager?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh? What kind of wager?" Rhodes asked, intrigued.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I have 200,000&nbsp;coins. If you can knock me off the stage or make me unable to stand within ten moves, the money is yours!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rhodes burst into wild laughter. Had Alexander lost his mind? He was already half a step into becoming a&nbsp;level-five warrior... ten moves? One would be enough!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He readily agreed. "Alright! I have 10,000&nbsp;gold coins&nbsp;and a prime estate in the southern part of the city, valued at 200,000&nbsp;coins. Let's make it fair!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hahaha..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two of them laughed heartily, each with their own schemes in mind. Below the stage, officials from the&nbsp;Ministry of Revenue&nbsp;stepped up to collect their wagers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The officials below the stage shouted excitedly, "Place your bets! Hurry up! A&nbsp;level-four warrior&nbsp;versus a&nbsp;level-three warrior..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julius&nbsp;was ecstatic. This was practically free money!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He grabbed one of the officials and roared, "Here's a 200,000-coin banknote! I'm betting on Rhodes Monroe to win within ten moves!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd surged forward like a swarm, with nine out of ten people placing their bets on Rhodes winning within ten moves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Logan, the&nbsp;Valdez brothers,&nbsp;Vegeta, and&nbsp;Nova&nbsp;pooled together 10,000&nbsp;coins&nbsp;to bet that Alexander would last all ten moves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander is at 1-to-10 odds! Let's go all in! Alexander, you got this!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Logan and his group were anxious, murmuring among themselves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the judges' platform,&nbsp;Fermin&nbsp;bowed to&nbsp;Fay Joel of the&nbsp;Ministry of Revenue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Joel, why are you even allowing this bet? Alexander is just a&nbsp;level-three warrior. Rhodes Monroe is guaranteed to win within ten moves!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
