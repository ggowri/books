  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, Alexander flicked his wrist. The Force wrapped around a nearby blade, sending it flying at the bald guy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The blade punched straight through the bald guy's chest, pinning him to the ground like a bug in a collection.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just like that, a crew of ruthless pirates lay scattered across the ground, and their blood turned the concrete into a crimson canvas.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander gave the scene one cold glance before texting William to send a cleanup crew.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cloe couldn't help staring at Alexander's profile. Something about him right now was just magnetic. Before she knew it, she was bouncing over to him with a grin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's get out of here and keep cruising!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander wrapped an arm around Cloe's waist as they hopped into the car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the beach, with the crystal blue ocean stretching out before them, Alexander and Cloe held each other close, and their faces were pressed together in a tender moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've missed you so much," Cloe whispered. She'd finally stopped crying, lifting her head just slightly to look at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm super excited that you'll be living on Treasure Island soon, but..." She bit her lip. "I can't help worrying about Ava. What if she doesn't want me around?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come on, you're overthinking it," Alexander laughed, planting a playful kiss on her soft cheek.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cloe snuggled deeper into his embrace. "Are you sure Ava won't have it out for me? I know she's the only one you really love. I'm just... passing through your life."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She tightened her arms around his neck. "But you know what? Just having had you at all is enough for me. I can deal with anything for you. Actually, just being in your arms like this... it makes me happy."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander gave a bittersweet smile, and his heart swelled with affection. A woman like Cloe was something special.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They stayed like that, savoring each other's warmth in comfortable silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Alexander was starting to lose his cool. Cloe's subtle perfume was driving him crazy, and even through her clothes, he couldn't help noticing how perfectly she curved against him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come on, didn't you miss me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cloe was still lost in the moment. After all, men and women often experienced intimacy differently. While men tended to focus on the physical aspects, women often found deeper meaning in the emotional bond.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander took one of her hands and shoved it toward his crotch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well? Do you miss me now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cloe's cheeks flushed, and she leaned into Alexander. Her right hand gently moved in his crotch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You have to promise me something. Even if Ava shows up on Treasure Island, you can't kick me out. I was never part of the Bryant family in the first place, and there's barely any of them left anyway..." Cloe sighed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander nodded, giving her head an affectionate ruffle. For someone so capable of running things on her own, she sure was emotionally dependent on him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, Cloe's breathing grew heavy. The cock in her hand radiated an intense, seductive energy, burning hot against her skin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In those few moments, her mouth went dry with desire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's left hand was squeezing Cloe's ass while his right hand was covering those soft breasts through her shirt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cloe gasped and held onto Alexander's shoulders, slowly pushing him down onto the bed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She could tell from the hardness just now that Alexander was enduring it, and she couldn't bear to let Alexander suffer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander lay down and closed his eyes with a smile, waiting for Cloe to serve him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cloe knelt beside her, stretching out her soft little tongue, licking carefully on Alexander's face, and gently biting his ears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander felt Cloe's sweet perfume as she kissed him, and her playful touch filled him with pure bliss.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking up, Cloe smiled, seeing the pleasure on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She buried her head in Alexander's neck and kissed him again, trailing lower until she reached his navel, and her tongue teased him with slow circles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander shuddered with satisfaction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, Cloe pulled Alexander's pants down with both hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She buried her cheeks in them, rubbing them greedily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's so hot!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cloe hummed softly and kept flicking her tongue over Alexander's cock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She opened her red lips wide before she was barely able to get Alexander's cock into her mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's hands weren't idle either, having stripped all of Cloe's clothes off with her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander looked at Cloe's upturned ass and smelled her pungent aroma. No man could look at it and not hold back a kiss. If there was, it wasn't a man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander, as a man, rolled over and pushed Cloe down and kissed her.</span></p><div class="pagination">
