  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elaine sneered enviously, "I think he is just pretending to be noble. Alexander will definitely charge royalties."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Experts immediately echoed this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, he doesn't charge the patent fee. Is he a fool?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Humph! I think Alexander is deliberately sabotaging us so that we won't have to pay him patent fees in the future. He is really a traitor."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The tone of some experts was filled with jealousy, and they wished they could become Alexander and have the ability to eliminate the plague.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander did not want to pay attention to these villains and said with certainty, "Loscity has suffered such a great disaster, and many people have lost their loved ones. If I still sell drugs at high prices at this time, am I still a human being?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've said it before, I will eradicate this plague, and I just want Loscity to return to the way it was before."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anderson excitedly led the applause.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eddy and other doctors and nurses were crying and looking at Alexander with admiration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"God bless you. Mr. Hawthorne must be sent by God to save us!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In this epidemic, most families in Loscity lost their loved ones and were deeply hurt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now that someone was finally able to eradicate the plague and had given up the huge patent fees to provide them with free treatment, it would be strange if they were not excited.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anderson handed the antidote to his men very solemnly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Go quickly and do as Mr. Hawthorne said, then notify the whole city and tell everyone to drink more water."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, Mr. Blunt!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Several guards left excitedly, holding a backpack of antidotes as if they were holding priceless treasures.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elaine snorted again, obviously still unconvinced, "Although Mr. Crawford seems to be better now, who knows if this medicine has any side effects? It may cause other harm to people."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as these words came out, some experts expressed their support.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, Dr. Bell is right. Although Mr. Archer is in good condition now, from a medical </span><span>point of view, we still have to treat it with caution. It must be clinically verified before it can be used on a large scale."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Blunt, we think you should consider this carefully!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anderson looked unhappy. He really didn't want to pay attention to these people. They were not experts at all but just lunatics.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Loscity had reached the most dangerous moment, but they were still doubting the effectiveness of the antidote, which clearly showed that they had bad intentions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elaine suggested and smiled, "Mr. Blunt, I think it would be better if Alexander handed over the prescription. Our expert group can verify it before we start using it for treatment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Otherwise, it will cause large-scale side effects, and Loscity will be even more dangerous. What do you think?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She looked confident that everyone would support this suggestion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The expressions of the experts present suddenly became complicated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Elaine didn't say it explicitly, everyone understood that they had to snatch Alexander's prescription, and after they verified it, they could sign their names on it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since everyone had signed their name on the prescription, they not only gained fame but also had the right to claim patent fees.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By that time, as long as they sued, everyone in Loscity would have to pay compensation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anderson had a gloomy face and said nothing. He was a smart man, so how could he not understand what these experts were thinking?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gideon couldn't help it anymore and said angrily, "You just want to steal Alexander's prescription. It's so shameless!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elaine pouted unhappily, "We are thinking about the health of everyone in Loscity. Are you thinking the wrong thing?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A bald man stood up to support Elaine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dr. Bell is right. We are all thinking about Loscity. Alexander must hand over the prescription for us to verify. Otherwise, I, Jake Deleon, will be the first to sue Alexander!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not only was Gideon very angry, but Melin, Eddy, and other people from Loscity Hospital also expressed their support for Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, everyone split into two factions and started arguing, making the situation a complete mess.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Quiet!" Alexander shouted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sound echoed in the room like a bell, and it was immediately silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander walked toward Jake.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jake felt a cold aura rushing toward him. Then, he shivered with fear and asked, "What...what do you want to do?"</span></p><div class="pagination">
