  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander chuckled darkly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You want to steal my magic powder formula, take my woman, and take down the Saint Group. Don't you know who my father is?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eddie's face turned pale, pointing at Alexander in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wait, you're... you're that old man's son?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How dare you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Eddie could finish, a sharp dagger was pressed to his throat, just inches from piercing his skin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two women screamed, backing into a corner in terror.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one else dared to move, fearing Alexander might kill Eddie with a single strike.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Wh</span><span>-what...what do you want?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eddie's eyes were wide with fear, and he was frozen in place, terrified of dying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander asked calmly, "Tell me, what's Satan's real name, and where is he?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're trying to find Godfather? Heh..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eddie sneered, slowly regaining his composure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, he was a seasoned boss, and the Cripples were a powerful force in the Underworld.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, I'll admit I underestimated you. Joseph and </span><span>Houtte</span><span> must've died by your hand, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Enough talk!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander moved the dagger, slicing a deep cut on Eddie's throat, and blood began to flow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eddie screamed again, clutching his neck with a look of agony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, don't think I'll betray the Godfather. I'll never tell you, even if it kills me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smiled broadly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Good, very good. For a gang leader, you're a loyal dog. In that case, I won't force you. I'll just send you to hell to meet Satan."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sharp blade pressed against Eddie's throat, ready to end him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The deadly killing intent made Eddie tremble uncontrollably. He wet himself in fear, and the sharp stench filled the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop! Let go of our leader!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Three bodyguards rushed at Alexander from different directions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One swung a machete, aiming for Alexander's head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The other two attacked from the sides, lunging at him like wolves, trying to pin him down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander didn't even blink, casually swinging his dagger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Slice!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The dagger, glowing faintly with Force, sliced through the machete and then effortlessly slashed across the attacker's chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without hesitation, Alexander swung the dagger back again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A faint glow of the blade swept over the two attackers from behind, and they froze as if under a spell, motionless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next second, a thud sounded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The three bodies dropped to the ground, cut cleanly into six pieces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blood gushed out like a spring, spreading a crimson bloom on the floor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two women screamed, clutching their heads before fainting in terror.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eddie trembled uncontrollably.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let me go. I'll pay you. Name your price."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, chaotic footsteps and shouting sounded from outside the hall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dozens of Cripples members swarmed in, armed with machetes, axes, and guns, surrounding Alexander with murderous intent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing his men finally arrive, Eddie was overjoyed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His expression turned, and he threatened viciously, "Alexander, you're surrounded. I don't care how good you are; how many can you kill? You'll die by my hand eventually, so I'd advise you to behave!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, you think you've got numbers? Why don't you look at who else I brought?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander gestured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Another wave of rapid footsteps came from outside the mansion as a hundred men in black stormed in, instantly encircling Eddie's men.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marvin and Logan led them, having rushed over at Alexander's command to surround the mansion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eddie and his men went pale.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander sneered. "You dared to lay a hand on my woman. Just for that, you deserve to die a hundred times!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A terrifying killing intent filled the air, making the room feel several degrees colder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eddie shivered </span><span>uncontrollably,</span><span> his face ashen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, the Cripples are under the protection of the Mafia. Our Godfather, Satan, is more powerful than ever. Don't dig your own grave!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
