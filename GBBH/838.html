  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The towering skyscraper was none other than the infamous Dragon Gang headquarters.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Over a hundred stories high, the building's fa&ccedil;ade was adorned with enormous LCD screens worth millions of dollars, streaming a continuous loop of movie covers and advertisements for Dragon Gang's film productions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Scantily clad, provocative women featured prominently in the ads, many of them top-ranked adult actresses in the industry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Just wait and see, I will definitely become rich. Then I will spend a fortune to invite you all over and have my way with you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Keith muttered to himself, his mind spinning with fantasies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But no matter how good his fantasies were, he had to keep going to work to survive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As the worst-performing salesperson in the company, Keith earned a pitifully low salary and was constantly berated by his supervisor. His colleagues looked down on him, ostracizing him at every turn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Keith! How many times have you been late this month? Bottom of the performance chart, and you're still late all the time. Do you even want this job? Get to my office later. I'll make sure you regret this!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His female supervisor harshly reprimanded Keith.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>To be honest, Keith thought the woman had a good figure, with big breasts and hips, and it would be comfortable to have her in his arms, but she was too fierce.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>During the company meeting, Keith sat in the corner of the office, watching the female supervisor while also checking out adult movies on his phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The night before, he'd stayed up late indulging in similar entertainment, even taking care of himself twice in bed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His escapades, however, left him drained rather than satisfied, making him oversleep and arrive late for work.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Plugging in his headphones, Keith immersed himself in the video with a subtle grin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Keith! What are you doing? Are you even paying attention?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Suddenly, the female supervisor roared angrily beside him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ah!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Keith jumped in shock, dropping his phone onto the floor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The headphones disconnected from the phone, and suddenly, the explicit sounds of a woman moaning and the unmistakable rhythm of passionate action blasted through the office.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ah... I can't take it... No!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>For a moment, the room fell into stunned silence. Then, the entire office erupted into laughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Keith's supervisor, humiliated and enraged, trembled with fury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Mortified, Keith scrambled to grab his phone and silence it, but the damage was done.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You... you disgusting pervert! Get out! Don't bother showing up again!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The supervisor shouted, like a mother tiger offended.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Without a shred of dignity left, he fled the office.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Moments later, he received the call he had dreaded. He was officially fired.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Keith wandered aimlessly down the bustling streets, his face downcast and his steps heavy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He reached into his pocket to find he had little cash left. His credit card was maxed out from paying rent. He couldn't even afford more than a few days' worth of meals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "Should I return to my parents or brother for help?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The last time he'd borrowed money, he'd been met with scorn and humiliation. He'd rather starve or sleep on the streets than endure that again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Why the hell do I even exist? What's the point of living this pathetic, useless life?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Keith shouted, dropping to his knees and clutching his head, his voice tinged with madness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Terrified pedestrians gave him a wide berth as he raged on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'll show everyone! I'll rise to the top! I'll become someone great!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I want to achieve my dreams! I will become the most badass man in the film industry!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The top ten actresses will all be my playthings. I will make you all kneel before me and submit!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Keith's outburst grew louder and more deranged, his face twisted with desperation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Some people even called the police, saying that on the busiest street of Azuran, there was a madman shouting about treating the top ten actresses as playthings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>From a distance, Alexander watched the scene unfold, a contemplative expression on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marvin, standing beside him, scratched his head awkwardly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Sir, I didn't realize my cousin had lost his mind. Please don't take this the wrong way."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander chuckled, his laughter deep and rich. His chiseled features, piercing gaze, and confident demeanor were magnetic. Women passing by couldn't help but steal glances at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This time, Alexander had only brought Marvin along, having promised him earlier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marvin had mentioned having a cousin in Azuran, though neither of them expected to meet him under such circumstances.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Keith, now slumped on the ground, was utterly defeated. Alexander strode forward with Marvin, heading straight toward Keith.</span></p><div class="pagination">
