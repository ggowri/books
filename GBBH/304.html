"Get out of here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, General."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His subordinates quickly retreated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Schroder sat there with a dark expression, silent for a long time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It must be Alexander causing trouble. That damn guy, I need that magic powder formula. He has to be eliminated."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He cursed Alexander, feeling an ominous premonition that more trouble was on the way...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next day, the sun shone brightly, and countless cheerful tourists flocked to the beach.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was the most famous beach in </span><span>Loscity</span><span>, bustling with visitors who either surfed in the waves or basked in the sun.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Many beautiful women paraded around in bikinis, their alluring figures drawing the attention of many, creating a scene of vibrant excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander, wearing sunglasses, appeared relaxed as he lounged on a beach chair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He held a pair of binoculars, observing a nearby villa with rocky exterior walls.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>According to his intel, that was Schroder's stronghold in </span><span>Loscity</span><span>, where Jane and her group were being held.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's physique was well-defined and muscular, perfectly balanced&mdash;not overly exaggerated like a bodybuilder, yet undeniably strong, with clearly defined abs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His sunglasses complemented his handsome features, and his tall, perfect build attracted many women's gazes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Some bold women not only stared but also flirtatiously tossed him coy glances.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While William discreetly protected Ava, Augusta, Marvin, and the recently released Logan from the hospital, along with thirty elite operatives trained in special forces, all concealed themselves among the crowd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They weren't distracted by the throngs of bikini-clad women. Instead, they kept a watchful eye on the villa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They surrounded Alexander, ensuring that any woman attempting to approach him was kept at bay.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"With that many bodyguards, he must be wealthy!" the onlookers remarked, their eyes on Alexander heating up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wow, what stunning beauties! Here they come!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, a man shouted excitedly, pointing in another direction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone turned to see the stunning Betty and Charlize strutting towards them in their sexy bikinis, radiating allure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They instantly became the focus of the beach.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not only the men but even the women present were captivated by their beauty, feeling momentarily inadequate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two beauties approached Alexander, flanking him, and no other woman dared to interrupt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, they drew envious and greedy looks from many men.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's everyone staring at? Get lost!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marvin shouted, brandishing his fist at the rude men, exuding an air of dominance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander chuckled wryly, realizing that allowing the two of them to come had created quite the stir, potentially alerting Schroder's men.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sure enough, he sensed a slight aura of hostility and immediately warned, "Everyone be careful. Disperse quickly&mdash;we've been compromised!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Augusta and the others discreetly signaled their subordinates to blend into the crowd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Alexander remained casually seated on his beach chair, his gaze sweeping around, quickly spotting several suspicious individuals approaching.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His remarkable hearing caught snippets of their hushed conversation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sam, are you sure that's Alexander? You're not mistaken, are you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Harper, I saw him clearly behind the general at the banquet."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is he here for a swim? Are we being too tense?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Regardless of whether he's swimming or not, this is a perfect opportunity to grab him and take him back. It would be a major coup, and the general will reward us handsomely."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing their conversation, Alexander smirked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had been contemplating how to infiltrate the villa, but it seemed they had walked right into his trap. If he took out these guys, it would significantly weaken Schroder's stronghold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Heh heh..." Alexander chuckled to himself, scanning the area to confirm the number of targets.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Over twenty sneaky individuals were edging closer&mdash;a considerable number.</span></p><div class="pagination">
