  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Chapman will definitely send someone to rescue us!" a team member called out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We just need to hold on and fight these monsters with everything we've got," another added.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The team members encouraged each other, their spirits lifting slightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hope remained as long as they could defend their position long enough.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing her team's renewed determination, Norah allowed herself a small smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, her expression changed. Her beautiful eyes widened in horror.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As a level-two metahuman, her enhanced vision let her see far beyond normal human capability. In the distance, she spotted a flood of mutant beasts pouring across the landscape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Holy carp! It's a beast tide!" she shouted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At Norah's warning, everyone turned to look. They froze at the sight before them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A dark mass had appeared on the horizon, stretching endlessly like a dam breaking. Countless mutant beasts surged toward them in a dense wave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This beast tide had to contain tens, maybe hundreds of thousands of mutant creatures.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone's faces turned pale. They knew they were so screwed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Norah took several deep breaths after her initial shout, forcing herself to stay calm and suppress her fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She stared at the approaching horde of monsters and spoke in a grim voice, "Is there any future left for humanity?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dozens of modified heavy trucks roared down the road, their powerful engines echoing in the distance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each truck had been reinforced with steel plates welded to its body. The front ends were shaped into sharp cones, boosting both defensive capabilities and ramming power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Besides the drivers, the trucks carried a hundred elites of the Ultimate Alliance, along with a stockpile of weapons and ammo.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander rode in the lead truck with Augusta and the others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the convoy sped forward, gunfire erupted nearby.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The landscape was overrun with mutant creatures. Even normally harmless animals like chickens and ducks had transformed into knee-high monsters that could fly like birds, complete with razor-sharp claws and fangs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cats and dogs had mutated into tiger-sized monsters that struck terror into anyone who saw them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Other mutations were just as bad&mdash;ants, rats, rabbits, monkeys, and even the actual lions and tigers from the zoo had transformed into something even more horrifying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All these mutant creatures had gathered together into one massive horde&mdash;endless like an ocean, sweeping across the world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even from over half a mile away, Alexander could see everything clearly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In his view, the mutant ants posed the biggest threat. Not only were there countless numbers of them, but each one had grown to the size of a regular rat, with what looked like rock-hard armor plating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The beast tide had formed, stretching as far as the eye could see, moving steadily toward the harbor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A group of over ten thousand mutant beasts had split off from the main force to surround a church.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inside, people were still holding their ground&mdash;the sound of gunfire echoing intensely from within.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander didn't know who was trapped inside, but there was no way he'd leave them behind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Still, trying to break through thousands of mutant beasts with his small team was a huge risk. Even if they survived, they'd take massive casualties.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander thought it over for a minute, and his serious expression cracked into a small smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He'd spotted something crucial&mdash;those mutant monkeys were crazy smart, actually directing all the other beasts around them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the main horde of mutant beasts moved away, over ten thousand creatures remained behind. Among them were about a dozen mutant monkeys.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These monkeys were commanding the other mutant beasts to charge forward&mdash;except for the mutant ants, which seemed to have their own unique communication and command system.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If they could take out those dozen mutant monkeys, they would basically destroy the command structure of this whole monster army.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander said gravely, "All the local comm systems are down. Get General Thompson on the satellite phone right now. Tell him about the situation at Louvian Port and request immediate air support.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Everyone get ready. We're going in for a rescue mission!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander barked out his orders.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words snapped the others out of their daze. The apocalyptic scene before them was beyond anything they could have imagined.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, aren't we way too outnumbered for this?" Augusta's face was tight with concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He would follow Alexander's lead without hesitation, but in this situation, they were basically walking into a death trap.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Augusta!" Alexander sternly called out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, sir!" Augusta's nervous expression instantly hardened into one of determination. All his doubts vanished as he stared intently at Alexander, waiting for the order to attack.</span></p><div class="pagination">
