They're extremely toxic. It's just one sting could kill an elephant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The shell doesn't usually break unless hit hard. We've reinforced it with special components to limit the wasps' movements, so it's safe otherwise."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barry explained in detail.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix nodded, feeling a shiver of unease but thankful to know about this weapon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Otherwise, he might've found himself caught off guard in his plans against Barry and Diego.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry; leave the backup plan to me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Good, very good!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barry nodded in satisfaction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're my brother now.
