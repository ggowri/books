  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sound of bones being chewed echoed through the forest, casting an eerie and terrifying atmosphere in the silent mountains.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander pursued the noise. The living dead were gone, leaving behind the mangled remains of Bruno's body on the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bruno's usually resolute face was twisted in a look of sheer terror as if he had witnessed something utterly horrifying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A helicopter lifted off from not too far away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander spotted three living dead hanging from a net beneath the helicopter, swiftly flying away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He recognized one of the passengers on the helicopter: Jake!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He remembered this guy. He was an expert who had come to Loscity Hospital with Elaine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed the appearance of these living dead was connected to the Sakra Society.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Mafia, City of Sorcery, Sakra Society. I won't spare any of you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander clenched Lightsaber tightly, his eyes fierce.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the helicopter, Jake wiped the cold sweat from his face, muttering to himself, "I underestimated him! Luckily, I got out fast. I didn't expect Alexander to be so formidable, not even the living dead could stand against him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The pilot, Landon, asked, "Mr. Deleon, we didn't complete the mission Mr. White gave us, and we lost three living dead people. What do we do now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jake rolled his eyes, annoyed. "Don't we still have three living dead? You don't get it. As long as we have one living dead, I can make it spawn an army."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Landon looked at him curiously. "How?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jake grinned smugly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Landon, if you get bitten by a living dead, within a few hours, you'll turn into a low-level zombie, fearless of death, without pain, and with only an instinct for blood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The only downside of a low-level zombie is that they can't obey my commands like the living dead. They can only be controlled through the command of the living dead."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Landon was shocked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stammered, "So... isn't that just like the Resident Evil? We'll be eaten by zombies!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jake chuckled evilly, "It's not the same. We can control the living dead to command the zombies, so the future of the world belongs to us, Sakra Society.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"When Mr. White truly masters the method of immortality, he's bound to initiate a great purge. There are too many humans on this planet, just wasting resources."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Landon's face turned ashen, unable to control his trembling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Deleon, what do we do now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jake pondered for a moment, then said, "Since Alexander is so powerful, a few living dead definitely won't be enough to eliminate him. Find me a remote village. I'll create </span><span>an army of fearless soldiers there, then lure Alexander in and make sure he dies without even a trace of bones left."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Landon's face grew even worse. He understood that the army Jake referred to would undoubtedly involve using live people to create zombies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you deaf? Did you hear what I said?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jake glared at him unhappily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Landon quickly nodded. "Yes, I heard you..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The helicopter flew away from Loscity, heading towards a small village at the foot of the mountains.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander returned to the Ultimate Alliance with a heavy heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone cheered when they learned that Bruno was dead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander couldn't bring himself to smile. He immediately called an emergency meeting with the top brass of the Ultimate Alliance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Betty, distribute the weapons. Everyone, stay alert and be prepared for any crisis at any time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Marvin, contact Augusta immediately and have him bring a thousand elite troops to Loscity. Speed is crucial.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Charlize, from now on, you and Rosalia will protect Ava and Ashley around the clock. Without my orders, you are not to leave their sides for a single moment."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, Boss!" Everyone agreed solemnly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Alexander didn't specify what would happen, the situation was definitely not going to be simple or easy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After the meeting, Alexander still didn't crack a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The terrifying faces of the living dead occasionally flashed through his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander had a premonition that the Sakra Society was about to unleash a disaster more terrifying than a plague.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Trouble seemed to follow trouble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, you're finally back!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander had just returned home when a beautiful figure threw herself at him, hugging him tightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Recognizing the familiar feminine scent, Alexander finally smiled. It was Rebecca.</span></p><div class="pagination">
