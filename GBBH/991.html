  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Oliver's face darkened as he thought for a moment before responding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He said, "Even if you've purchased the cemetery and have the necessary renovation permits, you still need the family's consent to touch this grave. Otherwise, forcibly digging it up is illegal!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Axel fixed Oliver with a sinister glare.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"So, can't we dig it up until they agree? This cemetery belongs to the Vance family now, and we're set on renovating it. This grave must be dug up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"These people are nothing but troublemakers! Not only are they obstructing our legitimate work, but they've also hired a sniper elsewhere to kill our men!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Benton, you claim to uphold the law, so why aren't you going after the sniper?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ryder immediately stepped forward, pointing accusingly at Ava and Lily. His tone was venomous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He said, "They're intentionally causing trouble to demand a huge payout! They hired the sniper! I saw them hire the assassin. I can testify that they're murderers!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Desperate to secure his position as the cemetery director, Ryder didn't hesitate to frame Ava and Lily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He falsely accused them of orchestrating the killings, trying to pin the label of murderer on them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Lily panicked, frantically waving her hands in protest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"We didn't hire any snipers! We didn't kill anyone... They're the ones trying to forcibly dig up the grave... This is my sister's grave... We don't want your money, and we absolutely won't agree to you digging it up!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"That's right! We don't want money. This is slander!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"We're here to protect the grave!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>More than a dozen relatives, their faces flushed with anger, shouted in outrage. None of them had ever encountered such shameless behavior from the Vance family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Oliver stared at Ryder with a blank expression and questioned him coldly, "You saw them hiring a killer? I don't believe it. This is your word against theirs unless you can provide evidence."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ryder was momentarily speechless. His accusations were fabricated. Of course, he had no evidence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, Asher's eyes gleamed as a plan formed in his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Benton, I have a way to prove that they arranged the sniper. My men were also killed by the sniper. I'll show you proof."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Asher pointed to one of his bodyguards and ordered loudly, "You! Take that shovel and start digging!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The bodyguard was stunned, his face turning pale with fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was clear that Asher intended for him to die. Anyone who touched the grave would be shot by the sniper.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne, I... I don't want to die yet..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The bodyguard stammered, his hands trembling as he begged.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Asher coldly threatened him. "Are you defying my orders? Disobedience will affect your wife and children. If you dig, you'll prove the sniper is theirs, and I'll give your family two million dollars in compensation."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The bodyguard, shaking uncontrollably, held the shovel but couldn't bring himself to act.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Dig! If you don't, you'll die, and your family will die too!" Asher roared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With gritted teeth, the bodyguard swung the shovel down toward the grave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Puff!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before the shovel touched the ground, a bullet pierced his chest, creating a gaping wound in his left side.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The bodyguard collapsed heavily to the ground, blood pooling beneath him like a crimson flower blooming in the dirt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Silence enveloped the scene. It was clear that anyone who tried to dig the grave would die.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Vance family's bodyguards turned pale, their bodies trembling involuntarily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Asher's actions chilled them to the core, filling them with fear that one day they might face the same fate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Hahaha!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Asher laughed maniacally, pointing at the twitching corpse, and said, "Oliver, did you see that? The sniper will shoot anyone who touches the cemetery, so the sniper must have been arranged by them. They are murderers!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He jabbed a finger toward Ava and her group, his accusations venomous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ava sneered disdainfully, "Asher, I'd say this is your scheme. You staged this whole scene to frame us so you can dig up the grave without resistance."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Oliver nodded repeatedly, his tone dripping with sarcasm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Well said, Mr. Hawthorne. Your accusations lack evidence. Two deaths don't prove anything. Perhaps you're the one who hired the assassin..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before Oliver could finish, Asher exploded in rage, cutting him off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Shut up! Shut your mouth, you idiot! You're doing this on purpose! You must have taken their bribes!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
