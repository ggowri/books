  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they made their way through the cave, the sight of Risunese corpses scattered all around was haunting. Among them lay Reece, marked by a grotesque black mole on his face. They had all met their end by a single stroke of a sword.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was taken aback by the sheer skill on display. "What incredible swordsmanship! Zain must be at least a level-four warrior," he thought to himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He patted Zamir on the shoulder. "Zamir, they're doomed this time!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Absolutely!" Zamir replied, excitement evident in his voice. Despite the cave's twists and turns, there was only one way out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Reluctantly, Zamir led the group back the way they came. They soon encountered Logan and the detectives tasked with guarding Alexander. Realizing the danger had passed, Zamir eagerly offered to guide everyone up the mountain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By the time they reached Walgus Church, dawn was breaking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon entering the church, they were met with chaos. Several Risunese and women were frantically trying to escape with their bags slung over their shoulders. The group killed all the Risunese. Several women were bound and taken away, accompanied by Raylan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zamir guided everyone into the woodshed cellar, where they managed to rescue dozens of women and found some clothes to cover themselves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Among those rescued, some were overjoyed, others seemed to have lost their minds and giggled uncontrollably, while a few emerged weeping loudly. A handful even came out screaming in distress.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Devil, give me back my child! Give me back my child!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing the bound Risunese and Raylan, they charged forward in a frenzy, poking eyes and biting ears in an uncontrolled rage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Some drew their swords, striking down the Risunese and Raylan, who screamed and writhed in pain as they were executed on the spot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The constable nearby frowned but made no attempt to intervene. Having heard Zamir and Alexander talk about the heinous acts committed by the Risunese, and now witnessing the harrowing scene in the cellar alongside the human bones in the kitchen steamer, his fury was palpable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zamir had already moved to the back of the mountain to rescue the imprisoned elders, while Alexander took Logan to Arturo's room. As Alexander cautiously searched under the couch, Logan rummaged around, knocking on various surfaces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Found it!" Alexander exclaimed, pulling out a small sandalwood box. Inside, he discovered two bottles of Docpirin, a stack of cash, half an eye mask, and three thin pages of yellowed paper.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>According to Zamir, Docpirin was made from thousand-year-old herbs. As long as someone wasn't dead, there was a chance to save them, and it could also increase one's original force. Each of them got a bottle, containing three pills each.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander eagerly counted the money.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It amounted to millions of coins, and his eyes sparkled with excitement. He could finally afford a big house in Darwin&mdash;and then he could spend every day with Isolde.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, are you stupid? Are you drooling or something?" Logan asked, bewildered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Snapping back to reality, Alexander retorted, "You're the one being stupid! You don't have to lick the lid while drinking yogurt!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Logan scratched his head in confusion. "Are you sure there's yogurt here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The half eye mask was peculiar. It was small, foldable, and made of sturdy fine steel. Its transparent curved glass lenses had ear protection at the back, with the word "Energy" engraved next to it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Curious, Alexander picked up the eye mask and tried it on. As soon as he did, numbers began to flash on the transparent glass.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"196!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Puzzled, Alexander wondered what the number meant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Logan took the eye mask off Alexander, put it on his own head, and glanced back at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"968!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why does the number change?" They stared at each other, perplexed, before setting the eye mask aside for now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander picked up the three pages of yellow paper and examined them closely. "It's all in the common language of the continent. One page details the formula for the Docpirin, while the other two describe techniques: Energy Wave Attack, Afterimage Technique, Energy Manipulation Technique, and Spirit Bomb. Mastering the Energy Wave Attack can lead one to become the legendary Super Saiyan."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They have Super Saiyans among the Risunese!" Alexander exclaimed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Logan grabbed the two pages and looked them over. "What the hell! This has to be a fake."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander took a deep breath and replied, "The second page is foundational for energy techniques. Whether it's real or not, we'll figure it out once we analyze it back home."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The official website claimed that a Super Saiyan's combat power exceeded 100 million, capable of effortlessly destroying anyone on Earth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thankfully, they had heard of masters who could contend with them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander and Logan fixed their gaze on the transparent eye mask.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Logan, give it to me! The combat power detector is mine!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"C'mon, Alexander, please! I just want to try it for a few days!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The room echoed with their sounds and Logan's exclamations.</span></p><div class="pagination">
