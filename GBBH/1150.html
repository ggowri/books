  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What are you two staring at? You're barely an improvement over that loser, but you're still losers," Stephen scoffed, his disdain palpable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tension filled the air as the two sides faced off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Karson was on edge, beads of sweat forming on his forehead as he watched Stephen intently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Alexander remained collected and unfazed as he leisurely continued to eat and drink.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, Stephen burst into laughter, shattering the tense silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He pointed at Karson and said, "Mr. Chapman, you've seen it, too. They're too scared to fight me. I'll give you one last chance</span><span>&mdash;</span><span>surrender Sunrise Group to me, and I might spare your life."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He turned coldly to Cesar and Travis, continuing, "You two should submit and become my slaves, and I might let you live."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for Alexander, Stephen dismissed him entirely, treating him like a fool for still feasting at a time like this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You've got two minutes to think about it!" Stephen arrogantly held up two fingers, dripping with disdain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Travis spat at Stephen's feet. "Who do you think you are?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His fingers cracked as he clenched them, and he had been utterly enraged by Stephen's arrogance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cesar's expression darkened; as a martial artist expert, he found it intolerable to be humiliated in front of so many people.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Go to hell!" Travis roared, stomping his foot hard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instantly, the floor beneath him shattered into pieces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He charged at Stephen like a cannonball, flames erupting from his head and palms, the intense heat warping the air around him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stephen wore a sinister grin, raising his saber high above his head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He showed no intention of dodging, prepared to stand his ground against Travis' onslaught.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When they collided, a sound akin to metal striking metal rang out, sparks flying like fireworks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, they were locked in battle. Flames roared in the hall as Travis unleashed his level-three fire power at full force, significantly amplifying his wrestling prowess.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he could just pin Stephen down, he would turn him into a charred corpse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Stephen was forced to dodge the surging waves of flame energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each punch and kick from Travis seemed capable of melting the air itself, causing the hard tiles beneath them to crack and melt as he passed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cesar found himself pushed back repeatedly by the raging flames while Karson felt the flames singe his hair and eyebrows.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Amazing! Truly amazing! If Mr. Stark catches Stephen, he's definitely done for," Cesar couldn't help but exclaim.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite being a martial arts expert, engaging with someone like Travis was far too dangerous; the combination of Travis' wrestling skills and Flame powers was lethal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cesar was getting on in years, and regardless of his expertise, he couldn't confront the flames head-on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In no time, the floor where Stephen and Travis fought was utterly destroyed, and the ceiling blackened from the relentless flames.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Travis put everything he had into his attacks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, there was a thunderous crash, and a figure was sent hurtling backward, hitting the ground hard before crashing into the wall and finally coming to a stop.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Karson and Cesar were taken aback. Travis had been defeated!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Travis had lost all the bravado he had just moments ago. His clothes were tattered, his body marred with deep knife wounds that exposed bone, and blood dripped continuously from his wounds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A particularly deep cut on his chest exposed his ribs, revealing his beating heart within.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Had he delayed even a moment longer, the blade would have pierced directly through his heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Travis screamed in agony as blood flowed relentlessly, transforming him into a bloody mess.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He attempted to rise, but no matter how hard he tried, he couldn't manage it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey, just two of you left now. Come on, let's wrap this up. I have to take control of Sunrise Group; I'm really quite busy." Stephen smirked malignantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't take Cesar and Karson seriously in the least.</span></p><div class="pagination">
