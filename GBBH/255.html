  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it!" Jamari put all his strength into his attack, but it was futile. Alexander sneered, and Jamari's fear grew. The sword was only centimeters from Alexander, but Jamari had failed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone in the Bryant family could see Jamari was in a bad spot. Suddenly, someone pulled out a gun and fired at Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bang! Bang!" The shots rang out, and Alexander released the sword to dodge. The shooter tried to pursue him, but Alexander landed a punch to his stomach, sending </span><span>him to the ground, bleeding and groaning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Freed from Alexander's grip, Jamari reassessed his opponent. Though Alexander had easily caught his sword with two fingers, Jamari believed he still had a chance. He figured he had just underestimated his enemy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Attack!" Jamari roared, stepping forward with a short knife in his left hand. With a sword in one hand and a knife in the other, he launched a frenzied assault on Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, a sinister force surged toward Alexander from behind&mdash;Guzman had cast a witchcraft curse. This supernatural power posed a real threat, forcing Alexander to retreat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the curse's grip was relentless, and Jamari's attacks were unyielding. Alexander was caught in a precarious position, battling on two fronts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Enough of this!" Alexander erupted with all his Force, using a technique known as Force Confinement. The room was instantly saturated with his power, even suppressing the witchcraft curse. Time seemed to slow, and everyone was taken aback.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander saw Jamari's movements as if in slow motion, exposing his vulnerabilities. He easily dodged Jamari's knife and landed a punch squarely on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bang!" The world snapped back to normal. Jamari was sent flying by the blow, his nose broken, his face bloodied. His weapons clattered away as he writhed in pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though victorious, Alexander was pale, having expended much of his Force. His strength wasn't enough to fully capitalize on Force Confinement, which only slowed others' actions. A more powerful warrior could have ended the fight instantly, pulverizing everyone else present.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn you, go to hell!" Alexander kicked Jamari, sending him crashing through the cabin glass into the sea.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the Force Confinement dissipated, Guzman regained his mobility. Shocked, he realized that even with his assistance, Jamari was no match for Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander advanced on Guzman, who stood still, seemingly paralyzed by fear. But Alexander noticed the cold ruthlessness in Guzman's eyes, unlike that of a normal person.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sensing danger, Alexander didn't hesitate. He punched Guzman in the chest, aiming to break his ribs. But Guzman's face darkened, taking on a ghostly appearance, prompting Alexander to retreat quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, Guzman's hand slashed through the air, black as ink, with skin like aged bark and sharp, claw-like nails. A pungent smell filled the room, sending shivers through everyone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Had Alexander been slower, he might have been caught by Guzman's terrifying black hand.</span></p><div class="pagination">
