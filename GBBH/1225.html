  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sheer power radiating from Alexander was enough to crush any hope Jonah had left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His face went pale as he felt the heat singeing his eyebrows and hair before the energy blast even reached him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No!" Survival instinct kicked in hard. Jonah pushed his abilities to the max, desperately trying to put some distance between them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But even at full speed, he might as well have been moving in slow motion compared to Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Alexander's Lightsaber was about to slice across Jonah's throat, it vanished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Jonah could process what happened, Alexander's hand cracked across his face like a whip.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The impact sent Jonah flying through the wall in a spray of blood, leaving him crumpled on the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander strolled over to where Jonah lay and looked down at him with pure contempt. "Still feeling like starting trouble?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jonah's face turned an ugly shade of purple as he struggled to get up, but his body wouldn't cooperate. There had never been any real contest. He knew Alexander had actually gone easy on him. If he hadn't, Jonah's head would be rolling across the floor instead of just sporting a nasty bruise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The hallway went dead silent except for the sound of everyone's heavy breathing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They'd all witnessed the fight. Despite Jonah pushing himself harder than ever before, unleashing power they didn't even know he had, Alexander had swatted him down like he was nothing more than an annoying fly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The weirdest part was that Alexander didn't give off even a hint of metahuman energy. How could someone with zero powers pull that off?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't just Ilona who was stumped&mdash;every metahuman in the room was scratching their head over this one.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fine, you win. I'll leave you alone." Jonah kept his head down as he forced out the words through gritted teeth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sure, his face showed he wasn't thrilled about it, but he knew when he was outclassed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if he somehow managed to reach level-five powers one day, he'd still be no match for a monster like Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jonah's mind was blown. How could someone as young as Alexander, with no powers at all, take him down so easily? And Alexander barely broke a sweat doing it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Good. You're smart to know when you're beat. Consider yourself lucky. I only let you walk away because General Thompson asked me to." Alexander gave a casual nod before heading towards Fernando's room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone was still processing what had just gone down. Jonah, the guy who always walked around like he owned the place and thought he was God's gift to fighting, had just admitted defeat in front of everyone. And he looked like he meant it, too.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd started buzzing with chatter, throwing around all kinds of theories.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sure, it had been one hell of a fight, but Alexander had made it look like child's play.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one was more pumped about it than Quentin, though. His face was practically split in half with a grin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander is just... superhuman. He's supposed to be just an ordinary guy, but even Jonah couldn't handle him. God, that's exactly the kind of man I'm into."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ilona's heart raced as she kept her eyes glued on Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She'd always been drawn to powerful people, but someone like Alexander was like finding a unicorn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What are you all standing around for? Keep searching!" Quentin barked at his subordinates, barely containing his good mood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They'd managed to take over Sakra Society's secret base without breaking a sweat, and there was a real shot at getting their hands on the pure Immortality Serum.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The whole operation had gone smooth as silk, all thanks to Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quentin had his men lock down the hallway, giving Alexander exclusive access to Fernando's room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment Alexander stepped </span><span>inside,</span><span> he could tell the place was a mess.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was pretty obvious Fernando had been caught sleeping when they'd stormed in. He must've bolted in a panic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's Enhanced vision picked up something off right away. There was a hidden passage under the bed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without hesitation, he flipped the bed aside and pressed his hand against a specific spot on the floor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The mechanism responded with a series of soft clicks, followed by the whir of gears turning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Several floorboards slid away, revealing a staircase about three feet wide that disappeared into the darkness below.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Did you find it?" Quentin could barely contain his excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If they could get their hands on the pure Immortality Serum, this raid would be a complete success.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But something was bugging him&mdash;Alexander had barely searched the room before finding this incredibly well-hidden passage. How the hell did he do that?</span></p><div class="pagination">
