  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What do you want from me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Loren's voice was hoarse, barely a whisper.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The longer he held his position, the more his nerves frayed, the quicker his strength drained, and the more his weakness became exposed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander remained unmoved, his face expressionless and calm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Yinson starts with the world leaders, causes global chaos, and then reactivates the Apocalypse Project. Am I right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Loren's eyes widened in shock. "How... how did you know?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander chuckled coldly, "Today's just not your lucky day. Go wait for Yinson in hell. He'll be joining you soon enough."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At that, Loren's heart twisted with fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Without wasting another second, Alexander unleashed his unseen Force, and with a single motion of his hand, the entire space seemed to freeze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Time itself felt suspended, everything around them frozen in place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Loren's eyes bulged as he struggled, trying to move, but his body was completely paralyzed under the pressure of Alexander's power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His right hand, which still gripped the dagger, was helplessly controlled, twisting until the blade pointed directly at his own heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Please... don't kill me! Yinson sent me... it's not my fault..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Loren's face contorted in a mix of fear and rage as he desperately pleaded for his life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The dagger, cold and sharp, pressed against his left chest, slowly sinking deeper.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"No! Please, I beg you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Loren's cries echoed with desperation, the sound so loud that Melin clamped her hands over her ears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Stop struggling. The more you fight, the worse it will get."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander sneered, his hand rising to strike again, the Force amplifying as he gestured with a single motion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Whoosh!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Blood splattered across the room as Loren's own dagger stabbed into his chest, driven by the immense force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At that moment, the excruciating pain jolted Loren's body back into action, and with sheer willpower, he pulled the blade away, ignoring the agony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The dagger hadn't pierced his heart, but it had sunk deep into his chest, blood pouring from the wound like a crimson fountain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Loren had been gravely injured but not dead&mdash;yet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ah! It hurts!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The pain seemed to push him over the edge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Loren's eyes burned with madness as he realized there was no escaping now. With a sudden, reckless motion, he reached into his pocket and pulled out a small vial of pale red liquid. He jabbed the needle into his arm, injecting the entire contents of the vial into his veins.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The color of the serum was familiar to Alexander, and his expression darkened instantly. This was a diluted form of the Immortality Serum.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It seemed Yinson had been busy, making new advancements in the serum's use.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The effects of the red serum were immediate. Loren's body seemed to surge with renewed vitality. His blood, once flowing freely from his wound, slowed to a stop, and his energy seemed to amplify.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His strength had skyrocketed. What was once a metahuman power comparable to level four had now reached an entirely new level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'll kill you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Loren roared in fury, hurling the dagger toward Melin with lethal speed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander caught off guard and yanked Melin out of the way just in time. The dagger tore through the air with a force so strong that it pierced the wall behind them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Without missing a beat, Loren leaped backward with a speed that defied belief, his body vanishing into the night like a phantom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander cursed under his breath, surprised by Loren's cunning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Melin dashed to the window, gun in hand, and fired.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Bang! Bang! Bang!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The deafening shots echoed through the building, startling everyone in the police station.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What's going on?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Who's shooting?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Suddenly, the blaring sound of alarms filled the air, and Oliver and his team rushed to the scene.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You take care of Melin. I'll go after the assassin."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With that, Alexander darted after Loren, following the trail of blood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He couldn't let the old man get away&mdash;not when Loren was so dangerous, stronger than Rosalia or Charlize.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the dark of the night, Loren's speed was remarkable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Despite his small, frail frame, he moved like a creature of the shadows, faster than Alexander had anticipated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Alexander was faster. He closed the gap between them, relentlessly pursuing his prey.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Realizing he couldn't outrun him, Loren swung around, tossing several small, black, spherical objects behind him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Grenades.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander dove behind a large tree just in time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Boom! Boom! Boom!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The explosions rocked the street, sending plumes of smoke into the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The shockwaves tore through the area, and several innocent bystanders were caught in the blast, their screams filling the air as blood stained the pavement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander's face twisted in frustration. "Letting that old bastard get away..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The situation was bad&mdash;Loren had used everything he had to escape, including the deadly serum, and now was out of reach.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Alexander wasn't disheartened. Loren had already taken serious damage, and there was no way he'd get out of this unscathed. He wouldn't survive long&mdash;especially after the red serum had given him a temporary boost.</span></p><div class="pagination">
