  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava pondered for a moment, then commanded, "Have people keep an eye on the airports, docks, and highways. We absolutely cannot allow the Red Umbrella Group to take Ashley out of </span><span>Loscity</span><span>."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosalia spoke cautiously, "Should we inform my master?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava gave her a complex look and suddenly asked, "When did you start calling him 'master'?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosalia's face flushed as she realized her slip.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava let out a soft sigh and changed the subject.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Since he's secluding himself for three days, it must be for something of utmost importance. So, we can't disturb him now, or it would be disastrous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Listen up, everyone. I'm issuing a bounty. Whoever rescues Ashley from the Red Umbrella Group will receive a reward of five billion dollars!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>An immediate uproar filled the room. Everyone was electrified. This was an astronomical reward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, the news of the Saint Group's president offering billions for Ashley's rescue spread throughout </span><span>Loscity</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Within half an hour, neighboring counties and cities had the news. An hour later, the </span><span>topic became a national headline.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not only were the Saint Group and Ultimate Alliance in motion, but families like the Hansens, the </span><span>Federers</span><span>, the </span><span>Kaylons</span><span>, and even assassins and bounty hunters from the dark web were all taking action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The police were fully mobilized as well. Eyes were on every airport, dock, and highway in </span><span>Loscity</span><span>, especially around the Red Umbrella Group's headquarters in </span><span>Loscity</span><span>, where countless individuals and groups were drawn by the reward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix smashed a glass on the floor, pointing at Kyle and swearing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kyle, how did you bungle this? Why did the news leak? Now everyone knows Ashley is with us. There are countless eyes on us now. Damn Ava. That woman is too ruthless! She's offering five billion dollars. Now we're the target of everyone!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kyle's face turned ashen. He moved his lips but didn't know what to say.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ella, standing nearby, revealed a rare smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What are you smiling at! Stop it. Damn you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix kicked Ella to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kyle, get a military transport plane from the department right away. I don't believe anyone would dare to stop a military flight."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Good idea, Felix."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kyle clapped his hands excitedly and hurried off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Alexander was busily crafting a Lightsaber.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He enveloped meteoric iron, mithril, and adamantium with the Force, melting them into palm-sized pieces, with all excess impurities refined away by the Force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This process of refining and fusing was incredibly draining on the Force. Alexander had to meditate three times to complete it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Next, he needed to carve this bimetallic material into a hilt and finally integrate the energy core to create the Lightsaber.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander began to meticulously carve with a knife, slowly shaping the incredibly hard material into the form of a hilt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unconsciously, the rudimentary form of the hilt appeared. Alexander then etched Esoteric Patterns onto it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These Esoteric Patterns would serve as an auxiliary to the Energy Convergence Matrix, helping the energy core gather power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander exhaled deeply. The Force was depleted again; he had to meditate once more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fortunately, he had reached the Intermediate Warrior level, or else he wouldn't have been able to complete such Force-consuming work.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Holding the knife, Alexander carved at a dazzling speed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Time passed from morning to evening, and Alexander finally completed the carving of the hilt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The gold and silver hilt was densely covered with Esoteric Patterns, constantly shimmering, exceptionally dazzling and magical.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Next, Alexander was about to start the most critical part&mdash;integrating the energy core into the hilt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He carved a depression that could hold a top-grade yellow gemstone, then embedded </span><span>the gem into it, enveloping the hilt with the Force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Force Burning!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A pale flame enveloped the hilt, burning with the Force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The scorching heat instantly filled the entire basement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The furniture nearby emitted a burnt smell, and even those guarding outside were sweating profusely, shocked and horrified.</span></p><div class="pagination">
