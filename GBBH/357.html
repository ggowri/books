  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those herbs were not worth much at all, and ten thousand dollars per bottle was quite good. As long as the production could keep up, the returns would be considerable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Besides the magic powder, it was another big money-making project for Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said sincerely, "Brittany, you will be responsible for the production and sales of the products, and we will each take half of the profits. How about that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brittany was stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The formula is yours. Are you willing to give me half of the profits?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a highly lucrative business. If it was promoted, it would definitely generate tens or even hundreds of billions of dollars in annual revenue.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, such a core product would bring huge attention and endless customers to the company's other products.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander nodded without hesitation. "Yes, I am!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He also had his own purpose. After all, Brittany was the granddaughter of a four-star general. He must maintain a good relationship with her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry. I will do it well."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brittany excitedly made a promise to Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, he picked her up and smiled, "Let's take a shower together."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're annoying!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brittany rolled her eyes at him shyly. "</span><span>So</span><span> you are also a lascivious man."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander carried her into the bathroom without hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ouch! Take a shower first. Don't be so impatient. The medicine may not have been fully absorbed yet."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brittany pinched Alexander coquettishly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He gently stroked her buxom breasts. She couldn't bear it at all. She was immediately turned on and couldn't even stand steadily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Please wait a moment."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brittany leaned weakly in Alexander's arms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Right here! There is a mirror. It's exciting!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander pressed Brittany in front of the mirror. She raised her full buttocks high and began to cooperate with him with a soft moan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A full hour passed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander finally released Brittany with satisfaction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She collapsed there joyfully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By the time they returned to bed and hugged each other, it was already dawn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brittany was exhausted from the sex and had fallen into a deep sleep.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander, however, was full of energy, feeling the growing Force within him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He took Brittany's virginity, which helped him digest and absorb a lot of James' Force this time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He gently wrapped his arms around her plump and charming body. What an </span><span>unforgettable experience!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander sent a message to Cloe, telling her that he would arrive at Treasure Island tomorrow. Then, he closed his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, in a clean white ward, the silver-haired elderly man lay on the hospital bed, his wrinkled face haggard and very weak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shadow in a black cloak stood nearby, head slightly lowered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Godfather, according to reliable intelligence, SATAN from the Mafia is gathering forces and may attack our headquarters at any time."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The elderly man coughed a few times and asked slowly, "Did Alexander ask Alice to warn us?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shadow nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But Anthony said nothing. It seems that he is very dissatisfied with me," the elderly man snorted, his eyes fierce.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shadow hesitated for a few seconds before saying in a deep voice, "Perhaps Mr. Anthony Hawthorne is too busy. The second generation of the power elixir is almost perfect."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The elderly man sighed, "Alas! The power elixir is ridiculous. It destroys the genetic stability of human beings. I am not optimistic about it. Maybe one day, he will cause a terrible disaster and even affect the entire human race..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shadow frowned deeply, not knowing what to say.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, the elderly man suddenly laughed happily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander attracts endless women. Compared to me back then, he is even more popular than I was! Maybe I can even have a grandchild soon."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shadow was speechless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were indeed countless women around Alexander, and they were all devoted to him. He was so charming that Shadow felt inferior to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next day, at noon, Alexander set foot on Treasure Island again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Compared with his first visit, his mood had changed a lot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although the Red Umbrella Group occupied a small area in the north of the island, the rest of the island belonged to him.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sooner or later, he would drive them away and dominate Treasure Island.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By that time, it would truly become a secret base under his complete control and would be his greatest backup and retreat.</span></p><div class="pagination">
