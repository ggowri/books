  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The crowd erupted in chatter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"She is gorgeous. If she were really a secretary, she'd make a ton of money every month, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Secretary? Alexander's just bluffing. He's full of it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Exactly! To find a woman that stunning and sexy for an act, she's probably just a call girl."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Not a single person believed Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander scanned the room with his deep, penetrating gaze and sighed silently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The kind-hearted classmates he once knew had changed, now shallow and materialistic, far removed from the innocent days of college.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Bobby sneered with a sarcastic grin, taunting Alexander. "How much do you even make? Why lie to us? You're the one who should be apologizing!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alice couldn't hold back anymore. With a sharp motion, she slapped Bobby across the face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The sound echoed in the room. Bobby stood stunned, clutching his burning cheek, his eyes spinning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I am the secretary to the chairman of the Saint Group. If you don't apologize, you won't live to see tomorrow!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alice's words, full of icy determination, sent chills through everyone. The room fell silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Saint Group was a household name in Loscity, and these small-timers knew better than to cross them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Bobby's face turned pale as he stammered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Alexander, why... why didn't you make that clear earlier? So she's really the chairman's secretary? My bad, really, I... I shouldn't have run my mouth!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Please, for Alexander's sake, don't take this to heart."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He added, slapping himself to show remorse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alice huffed, clearly unimpressed, before stepping back to Alexander's side after noticing his silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Alexander, I'm so sorry. Please, have a seat. Both of you are honored guests."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Bobby said with an obsequious grin, eagerly inviting them to sit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The tense atmosphere began to thaw, and everyone took their seats, though many continued to eye Alice with curiosity and doubt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The question lingered in their minds why would a high-profile secretary from the Saint Group be so deferential to Alexander?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Was this really true?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Bobby, trying to break the ice, raised his glass.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Let's toast to the success of this gathering!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After the toast, Bobby slyly asked Alexander, "So, are you working for the Saint Group now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He was fishing for information, clearly skeptical of Alice's claims.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander cast a cold glance at him. "I don't see why I should share my private affairs with you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Bobby rolled his eyes, assuming Alexander was unemployed. His confidence surged.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Grinning slyly, he turned to Alice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"So, Alexander, are you being kept by this lovely lady? You're a married man. How can you fool around like this?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Why not join my company as a security guard? I'll even pay you five hundred dollars more each month. That's a fair deal! I own two companies, you know. Even my security guards earn three thousand dollars a month."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A few classmates chimed in, laughing, "Bobby, you're too generous. Cheers to you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"An extra five hundred dollars a month, that's six thousand dollars a year! Alexander, if you're out of work and relying on her, maybe working for Bobby would be a better move."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Their mocking tone and greedy glances directed at Alice were impossible to ignore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They wondered why someone would as beautiful and alluring as her be with a so-called loser like Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The sycophantic classmates raised their glasses, flocking to Bobby and showering him with flattery, effectively sidelining Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They had clearly decided Alexander and Alice were lying, their attitudes flipping instantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>One woman, emboldened by Bobby's wealth, batted her eyelashes at him and sneakily ran her hand up his leg under the table. He was too rich.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander smirked, watching their antics like a crowd of clowns.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alice's chest rose and fell in anger. She wanted to lash out at their foolishness but stayed silent, waiting for Alexander's cue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But without Alexander's go-ahead, she held her tongue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A gaudily dressed woman squeezed closer, leaning her chest against Bobby with a shamelessly fawning expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She turned to Alexander with mock indignation. "Why aren't you saying anything? It's so rude! Bobby is offering you such a good job and salary out of kindness. Don't be ungrateful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"And your woman even slapped him! You two are putting on quite the act, pretending to be with the Saint Group. But we're not idiots. You can't fool us."</span></p><div class="pagination">
