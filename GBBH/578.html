  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix ignored him, surprised that someone dared bring the fight directly to the Morris family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anyone bold enough to confront the Morris family directly was certainly not an ordinary man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix followed Weston into the inner courtyard, occasionally noticing bodies sprawled out among the plants or on the pathways.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Felix's worry deepened, the scene before him opened up to a large clearing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the vast courtyard stood a well-built, expressionless man in his middle age.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His skin was softer and smoother than most women's, gleaming like flawless ivory.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man stood there casually, hands behind his back, yet he radiated a shocking, intimidating presence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Morris!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Weston bowed his proud head in reverence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was the Morris family patriarch, Frederick Morris.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Frederick gave a brief huff, waving his hand, and Weston quickly stepped aside to await instructions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix, usually full of confidence, now felt a growing unease, his heart racing. Frederick was nothing like he'd expected.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He'd assumed the patriarch would be a bloated, corpulent man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Frederick looked unassuming and radiated such an intense aura that even Felix, a level-three metahuman, felt intimidated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix reined in his energy and obediently lowered his head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His greatest asset was his sense of timing. He knew when to be flexible and adapt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Facing someone as terrifyingly powerful as Frederick, Felix knew he'd need to absorb many more elite warriors to match him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though Felix behaved meekly, he still held himself with composed dignity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Frederick narrowed his eyes, a little surprised. Felix's calm under his oppressive aura suggested he was no ordinary man, at least on par with Diego and Barry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix's strength was indeed beyond Frederick's expectations.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Red Umbrella Group's chairman was tougher than Frederick had anticipated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix took the opportunity to apologize, "Mr. Morris, I don't know something significant happened in the Morris family. I'm sorry. Please forgive me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Heh..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Frederick chuckled coldly, neither agreeing nor disagreeing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix seemed unaffected by Frederick's disdain and instead asked warmly, "Mr. Morris, who are these people, daring to provoke the Morris family?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Frederick gave Felix a long, hard look and slowly replied, "A bunch of clowns who won't be causing much trouble."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix smiled, curious about what Frederick had in mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a pause, Frederick's expression grew solemn as he asked, "You said that Barry and Diego are both dead?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix nodded. "Yes, killed by Alexander and the Kaylon working together."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Frederick's eyes flashed with a deadly glint.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Felix, how dare you lie to me! If they're dead, how did you make it back alone? You must have been involved!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix's body shook, his face showing shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Morris, my hatred for Alexander runs deep. I'd love nothing more than for him to be dead. Why would I help him kill your family?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Barry was set up in the casino and lost Joyce to the Kaylon. He and Diego tried a midnight rescue, only to fall into a trap.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I was their getaway driver and barely escaped. If you don't believe me, send someone to check with the Kaylon."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Frederick remained silent, scrutinizing Felix's expressions and mulling over every word he'd said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The silence was thick with tension, and Felix was ready to bolt at any moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, Frederick let out a cold laugh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That Alexander dares to join the Kaylon to harm my family! Anyone who dares to oppose the Morris family is signing their death warrant!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mighty as always, Mr. Morris!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix lowered his head respectfully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Frederick detected nothing suspicious about Felix. In fact, he seemed somewhat impressed by Felix's abilities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Since Alexander has managed to kill even Diego and Barry, it seems I'll have to </span><span>handle this personally."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A sudden surge of murderous intent filled the air, making Felix's back go cold. His body tensed like a spring, ready to flee at the slightest indication of danger.</span></p><div class="pagination">
