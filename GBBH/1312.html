  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donald's heart skipped a beat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ben, these two were originally Risun slaves. Out of the Head Priest Hezekiah's mercy, they were allowed to work in the church. But they haven't changed their ways. Their harvest was insufficient, and now they've stolen the Melon King. According to the rules, they should be expelled and sent to Darwin Court," Donald declared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ben's expression remained calm. "Donald, if I recall correctly, these two were only registered three months ago. Not everyone working in the church has the same aptitude. Some take longer to master the Energy-Gathering Technique. Isn't it customary that during their first year, they are only required to do chores and not grow melons?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donald said nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cleveland and Rory's faces turned pale.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ben continued, "If they didn't grow this Melon King, then where exactly did they steal it from?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donald's face twitched. He let out a cold snort but remained silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cleveland sensed trouble. He exchanged a glance with Rory, and the two began inching backward, trying to blend into the crowd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Where do you think you're going?" Nathan's voice boomed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nathan pointed an accusatory finger at Cleveland. "You heartless bastard. You sold your own sister to Donald! But she had too much pride. Today, she went to Darwin Court, cried out for justice, and then took her own life by ramming into a pillar! The judge has already issued an order. Cleveland, you're under arrest!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At his words, several fierce-looking officers stepped forward, their chains and shackles clinking ominously. They seized Cleveland, locking him in iron restraints, and dragged him away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His wretched cries echoed in the distance. "I'm innocent! I was forced! It was Donald! Donald made me do it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donald's face darkened, his expression twisting in fury. He forced himself to remain composed. "Since Ben insists the Melon King wasn't stolen, then let them go," he said stiffly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without another word, he turned and hurried away with his soldiers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ben's voice rang out behind him. "Donald, Mr. Webster has returned. He's heard about everything that happened. He wants you at Aureate Hall immediately."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donald stumbled slightly but did not turn back. He walked straight to the Teleportation Plate at the manor's entrance and vanished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rory tried to slip away in the commotion, but Alexander grabbed him firmly. "Where do you think you're going, Rory?" he barked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mercy! Mercy! I was forced!" Rory pleaded, his voice trembling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nathan sighed. "Rory, you've been expelled. Jedidiah, take him to the court. He can keep Cleveland company."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Bonnekamp. No, Nathan! Have mercy!" Rory wailed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the workers had already tied him up with coarse rope and dragged him away. His desperate cries faded into the distance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It turned out that Jalen was Nathan's grandson. Ever since Cleveland and Rory had destroyed Alexander and Logan's melon fields, Jalen had begged Nathan to help them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At first, Nathan had been reluctant to get involved. Cleveland was trouble, and Donald was even worse. But since Ben had personally sent Alexander and Logan, Nathan had no choice but to speak with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Ben refused to intervene, there was nothing he could do. Donald was involved, and Cleveland was not someone to be taken lightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, Nathan took Jalen with him to meet Ben and explained everything that had happened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though Ben was usually quiet and avoided interactions, he couldn't ignore the matter since Alexander and Logan had undergone a Spiritual Awakening under Head Priest Hezekiah's guidance. He had to act.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, he had to uphold Head Priest Hezekiah's dignity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cleveland's sister had a strong spirit. After suffering humiliation, she wept for days. When Cleveland was busy delivering melons, she seized the chance to escape. She fled to Darwin Court and pleaded for justice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She found Governor Jeffrey and told him everything. Then, before anyone could stop her, she took her own life before his very eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeffrey had always despised corruption and cruelty. As governor, he had punished countless criminals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, faced with such an atrocity, he was furious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The kingdom's laws, and even the Dominion Church's decrees, were clear. No one, friar or layman, was permitted to violate women at will. Without hesitation, Jeffrey dispatched his most trusted officers to make the arrest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The officers, however, could not simply storm into the Dominion Church. Instead, they sought out Nathan at the Management Center.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Nathan learned the details, he was delighted. He immediately led the officers to meet Ben, and together they made their way to Emerald Manor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, as the dust settled, Ben turned to the two Melon Kings. He examined them carefully, then looked at Alexander and Logan. A faint smile appeared on his lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You did well. This year, your melon harvest ranks among the top two. These Melon Kings will be sent to the Fathers. Each of you will receive a piece."</span></p><div class="pagination">
