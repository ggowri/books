Thank you, Mr. Cavill!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nathan stroked his beard and smiled at Alexander. "Cleveland has committed a crime beyond forgiveness. Emerald Manor now has a vacant overseer position. Would you be willing to take it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander lowered his head slightly and bowed again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With humility, he replied, "My brother and I have only been here for three months. We are inexperienced. It is only through everyone's kindness that we have a life like this now. I am not worthy of such a position."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Nathan could respond, Jalen jumped out from the crowd and shouted, "Who dares to object? No one but you has ever grown a Melon King!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's right! Growing a Melon King is no small feat!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Jalen leading the charge, the rest of the crowd had no choice but to chime in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, you're the best choice," Logan added, grinning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Very well," Alexander finally said. "Since you recommend me, I won't refuse. I'll take the position."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Having no other choice, he accepted the role of overseer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Good," Nathan said. "Now that the matter is settled, I have other places to be. I'll take my leave."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ben turned and headed for the Teleportation Plate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd had been busy all morning. Exhausted, they glanced at the sun, now high in the sky, and dispersed to have lunch and tend to their own affairs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At Dominion Church's Top Court, within Aureate Hall, a towering golden statue stood at the center. It was nearly thirty feet tall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The statue depicted both male and female figures. The male, with a golden war helmet, had a fierce expression with sharp fangs. He held the female tightly in his arms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The female, with seductive eyes and a curvaceous figure, faced him, her legs parted. She sat on his lap, her rounded hips resting against him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their four arms intertwined in an intimate embrace, their bare bodies pressed together in a pose of union.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beneath the statue, an elderly man sat cross-legged on a cushion. He was Lincoln Webster, the leader of Dominion Church's Treasure Sect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wore a yellow cap and a crimson friar robe. His lips moved in silent prayer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Webster."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donald entered the hall and gave Lincoln a deep bow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lincoln slowly opened his eyes. "Donald, do you realize your mistake?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donald immediately lowered his head. In a loud voice, he answered, "Mr. Webster, I do not know what mistake I have made!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lincoln's brows furrowed. His voice was steady but firm. "Donald, both our laws and the kingdom's laws are clear. No one, under any circumstances, may violate women!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donald's eyes widened. He suddenly stood up and shouted, "Mr. Webster, is it a crime to love women? You yourself&mdash;this must be the Great Sect trying to suppress us Treasure Sect followers!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lincoln's voice thundered through the hall. "Nonsense! How dare you speak like this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donald clenched his fists but said nothing. He lowered his head in submission.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lincoln sighed deeply. "Do you know why your master, Carlos, betrayed Dominion Church sixteen years ago?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donald's head snapped up in shock. "I... I don't know. I thought&mdash;it was the Great Sect who forced him&mdash;"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Donald, your master Carlos was extraordinarily gifted. He entered the church at the age of five and trained under me. By thirty, he had reached enlightenment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But he was arrogant. He indulged himself recklessly. In the end, he could not control his desires and committed unspeakable atrocities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He was lured away by the Risunese dark god, Enid Perkins. He fled to the Risunese lands, and it has been sixteen years since."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lincoln let out another deep sigh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donald's face was filled with disbelief. "Mr. Webster... So my master wasn't betrayed by the Great Sect?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lincoln's sharp gaze locked onto him. Slowly, he spoke. "Some call dual cultivation a path of demons. But that is only because they do not understand its true meaning."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The scriptures say: When one is poisoned, the right poison can drive out the venom. When one is consumed by desire, that very desire can be used to tame itself. But recklessness leads only to destruction."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donald remained silent, his head lowered. A spark of realization flickered in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Lincoln's voice grew louder, echoing through the hall. "Donald, when I look at you, I see Carlos. It is my failure that I did not guide you better. Now, do you understand your mistake?"</span></p><div class="pagination">
