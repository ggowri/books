  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The special steel door, nearly three feet thick, slowly descended, completely isolating the large shelter, which extended dozens of feet underground, from the outside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This shelter stored weapons, ammunition, and enough food and water to sustain hundreds of people for several years.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the middle floor, there was a soilless cultivation laboratory, which covered more than a thousand square meters, equipped with an artificial photosynthesis system and a small spirit-gathering array arranged by Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the bottom of the shelter was the living area. There was an air circulation system, and with the help of the spirit-gathering array, people wouldn't feel stuffy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although the rooms there were not yet completed, having a place to live at this critical moment was already a remarkable blessing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander... will be fine," Ava said, but she didn't have much confidence herself. Her sad expression had already betrayed her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The atmosphere was rather solemn, and even Augusta and a few of his friends kept straight faces and remained silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing this, Ava stood up, clenched her fist, and cheered everyone up. "Alexander will definitely come back! No matter what happens, we must survive for our families and ourselves."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this critical moment, Ava showed her rare leadership qualities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Ava's resolute expression and hearing her decisive words, everyone felt inexplicably more at ease.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yinson was furious. He stared at the huge screen. Dense red rays were emitted, heading towards various areas around the world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hundreds of blue lines launched from powerful countries like Raquel were rapidly approaching Risun, and the location where Yinson was located was the focus of dozens of blue lines.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The ear-piercing alarm and the data on the screen explained everything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it!" Yinson roared. He was well aware of the terrifying power of this destruction. He never expected that these people would actually have the guts to choose mutual destruction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In his prediction, no one would dare to court death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yinson could feel the breath of destruction. It was a power that made him feel fear and tremble. The headquarters of the Sakra Society was a key target.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the screen, a row of changing numbers appeared in the upper-right corner.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"4069!" It was the number of atomic bombs launched globally detected by the satellite. These bombs were enough to cover and destroy the earth. Everything seemed too late.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yinson never expected that the situation would develop into such an out-of-control state. He trembled slightly, and the only thought in his mind was regret.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Warning! Warning!" Suddenly, the piercing alarm in the base rang out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Red countdown numbers appeared on the screen. There were only sixty seconds left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the distant night sky, several fire-like meteors gradually appeared. These fireballs rapidly glided through the atmosphere, and there were dazzling spherical flames as if meteorites from space were crashing down toward the base.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yinson was shocked. He quickly fled, leaving behind Alexander in the nutrient tank.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't want to stay here. The atomic bombs in the sky terrified him. Moreover, it was far from just those few. More terrifying fireballs were rapidly approaching.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When the first fireball landed in the center of the base, the huge explosion could instantly deafen people.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>An orange-red mushroom cloud rose hundreds of feet high, releasing a violent and irresistible shockwave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The base was like a ship caught in a terrifying storm at sea. The hard ground was like a trembling carpet, and terrifying trenches, bottomless, appeared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not to mention monsters, even skyscrapers collapsed like building blocks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The night sky had been illuminated, looking like the afterglow of the setting sun.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Following the first round of explosions, mushroom clouds appeared one after another in Healiva.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The blinding light pierced through everything, and intense radiation burst out from the explosion center.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Huge mushroom clouds rose, and the churning red clouds in the night sky were like a demon ready to devour everything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The dazzling flash gave people the illusion that the Earth had become another sun.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The terrifyingly high temperature and strong radiation destroyed everything. Whether it was steel, buildings, or monsters and humans, they were all destroyed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dozens of atomic bombs with destructive power attacked Yinson's base. The dazzling white light and terrifying energy and radiation made Yinson feel a burning pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He closed his eyes and endured the last moments of approaching death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the raging, terrifying storm, his skin turned black. The smell of his roasted muscles filled the air, and even his bones and joints ached severely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The blood in his whole body seemed to boil. The intense high temperature made him feel as if his organs were being pricked by needles, and there was even a feeling of burning up and turning into ashes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yinson fell heavily onto the scalding ground!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mushroom clouds appeared one after another. The power stacked together was terrifying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Another warhead accurately hit the damaged base, creating a deep pit with a radius of hundreds of feet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yinson's body melted in the high temperature.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The violent airflow pushed this strange mass of light high into the air, and it rolled and finally disappeared in the night.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mushroom clouds rose one after another around the world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was a real night. The apocalypse came without any warning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one could predict what the future would be like.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one knew how long had passed. The sea of clouds churned, and a dim light faintly refracted through the gloomy sky.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sun could no longer be seen, but there was a bit of light, indicating that a new day was coming.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The ground was covered with weeds, mud, and sewage flowing like a small stream.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If people stepped a little deeper, they could smell the nauseating stink in the mud.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The prosperity of cities was long gone. There were only ruins, and even the thumb-thick steel bars were rusty. They could be broken easily with a little force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The land was a paradise for rats, cockroaches, and various insects. The rats were as big as cats.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cockroaches were not afraid of radiation. They were indestructible. With an extremely strong reproductive ability, a large number of cockroaches swarmed out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Some rats found a charred thing in the mud. Although it was charred, the sensitive rats smelled something different.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They circled around the charred object, and it seemed to find sweet food.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When a group of big rats managed to dig this huge charred object out of the mud with great effort, there was a click. The object suddenly exploded, scaring the big rats so much that they all retreated backward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Immediately afterward, there was a series of clear cracking sounds. Several cracks suddenly appeared on the surface of the charred object.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amid the series of cracking sounds, the charred object exploded. Its shell shattered, revealing a naked person.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man was hugging his knees with his arms like a baby. His skin was delicate and smooth, without any scars at all. He even exuded a faint, soft light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander opened his eyes, which were still clear and bright, but there was a hint of confusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He silently looked around. The first thing he saw was that group of big rats. He frowned and glared at them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These sensitive rats scurried away and disappeared in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This world was completely different from the familiar one in Alexander's memory.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Scenes of memory fragments emerged in his mind. It brought him back to his senses. He finally realized that he was still alive. "Ava, Ashley..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The smile of survival on Alexander's face disappeared instantly, replaced by a livid look.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A gray mist enveloped the earth, and a faint red light shone from the east.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although the thick fog in the sky never dissipated, and the sun couldn't be seen, Alexander vaguely felt a little warmer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His skin became even smoother. His body conformed to the golden ratio. His powerful muscles presented smooth and beautiful lines. His eyebrows were thick, and his eyes were bright, deep, and full of power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking around again, Alexander didn't find anything that could be used to cover his body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were only dilapidated buildings, mud, and overgrown weeds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing the lush weeds all over the ground, Alexander frowned. He thought, "Had a long time passed before I woke up? Otherwise, why would there be knee-high weeds everywhere?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander walked up to a broken pillar and touched the severely rusted steel bars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two-finger-thick steel bar broke like biscuit sticks when he exerted a little force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although the outer layer of the steel bar was rusted, there was a finger-thick part in the middle that was as new as ever and very tough, but it broke in Alexander's hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was just a casual break, but this terrifying power far exceeded the power Alexander had before he fell into a coma.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joy and excitement appeared on his face. He looked at the dim sunlight, identified the direction, and ran towards Treasure Island...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The End.</span></p><div class="pagination">
