  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dad, he beat me in Gemstone Street, and everyone saw it. If you don't help </span><span>me</span><span> get </span><span>revenge, how will our family manage Gemstone Street in the future?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angelica asked angrily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aiden looked at the bodyguard and asked angrily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's wrong with you? I asked you to protect Angelica? Why did she get beaten up?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The bodyguards blushed and lowered their head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sir, that guy is an expert. He took us down before we even made a move. We are no match for him at all..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Humph! Losers. How dare you claim to be the top fighters of our family! Bullshit."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angelica cursed with contempt. And the two bodyguards were angry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aiden muttered to himself with some emotion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You two are the top warriors of our family. Even in </span><span>Loscity</span><span>, you are considered pretty good. That guy was able to defeat you with just one move. It seems he is a real master!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aiden carefully selected these two bodyguards to protect Angelica. He knew best whether they were capable or not, but they were knocked down by the other party in one move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dad, replace them. I don't want such useless bodyguards."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angelica said very dissatisfiedly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two bodyguards said nothing, but they had already cursed Angelica in their hearts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aiden pondered. If that man was related to Xavier, could he be invited to compete with the Carter family?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he won, Aiden would retain control of Gemstone Street.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aiden sighed. Angelica had just offended Alexander, they could not ask him for help.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dad, Xavier has a good relationship with that kid. Could it be that Xavier deliberately asked him to beat me up?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angelica asked angrily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aiden was surprised. "Is Xavier really close to him?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, they have a good relationship. Dad, when did you take over Phoenix Gemstone Establishment? We can't let Julia and Xavier continue to be so arrogant."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aiden was silent for a while and finally made up his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Honey, please bear with this matter for now. I want to use him to defeat the Carter family and firmly grasp the control of Gemstone Street."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dad, what are you talking about! You should catch that guy and Xavier, teach them a lesson, and make them apologize to me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angelica was still shouting indignantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander returned home and bought a dozen gems of good quality from Phoenix Gemstone Establishment, preparing to continue practicing carving </span><span>Spellweave</span><span> Pattern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He first used a carving knife to cut open the yellowish stone. The stone was harder than steel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Alexander concentrated his Force on the carving knife and carefully cut open the </span><span>stone bit by bit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A piece of golden yellow gemstone appeared before his eyes, which was in no way inferior to the one that was auctioned before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander let out a breath excitedly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then he began to practice carving </span><span>Spellweave</span><span> Pattern with gems, striving to complete the carving of 108 </span><span>Spellweave</span><span> Pattern as soon as possible, forming Energy Convergence Matrix, and completing the energy core of the Lightsabers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was completely immersed in it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even when Ava knocked on the door, he didn't open it, but concentrated on carving.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a sleepless night without food or water, Alexander finally carved seventy-two </span><span>Spellweave</span><span> Pattern on a gem the next morning after he had destroyed most of the gems.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was filled with joy. His skills in carving </span><span>Spellweave</span><span> Pattern improved a lot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He felt that there was more Force in his body. He didn't expect that practicing carving </span><span>Spellweave</span><span> Pattern could also increase the Force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If I can </span><span>sex</span><span> more with Ava and the others and practice more </span><span>Spellweave</span><span> Pattern, the effect will be much stronger than just meditation."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking, Alexander should a meaningful smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he could control all the Force left by James, he could be promoted to an intermediate Warrior.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this time, Xavier suddenly called Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Xavier said, "Alexander, Aiden asked me to invite you to meet him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why? Does he want to fight me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's tone was cold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Xavier hastily denied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, Aiden said he wanted to apologize to you and asked you for something. He even prepared a top-grade ruby for you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander said, "Really? Is Aiden so kind?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This surprised Alexander.</span></p><div class="pagination">
