  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In no time, Rosalia's crazy moan echoed in the study.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Early the next morning, Alexander opened his eyes from meditation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Last night, he not only wore Rosalia out but also called Charlize to the study for a threesome game.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After having sex with them, Alexander's Force increased quite a bit, but he was still far from advancing to the "expert" level warrior.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Becoming an expert-level warrior required the Force like a huge lake.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And compared to that, the Force in Alexander's body was almost negligible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After enjoying sex with them, Alexander meditated until dawn so he felt no fatigue. Instead, he felt invigorated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He made a video call to Cloe, chatting about the progress of the construction on the </span><span>two islands while checking the actual situation via video.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cloe deployed a drone, sending the footage to Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under the golden sunlight, the southern part of Treasure Island, which had originally been a desolate mountainous area, had been completely transformed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Around the water source in the central area were blocks of farmland.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thanks to the magic circle arranged by Alexander on Treasure Island, the crops planted in these fields would not be destroyed by storms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were also towering wind turbines in the fields, with huge propeller blades spinning as they caught the sea breeze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cloe excitedly introduced, "Boss, these wind turbines can completely meet all our electricity needs on the island, and there is surplus power. We stored that, ensuring that even after a power outage, we have seventy-two hours of electricity supply."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well done. But you need to stock up on some maintenance parts. It might not be possible to purchase them later."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander praised first and then reminded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, don't worry. We have one billion dollars in special funds to purchase maintenance parts and bring in power talent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Our reserves are enough to ensure </span><span>that </span><span>the wind power generation on Treasure Island and Devil Island operates for over a hundred years."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander nodded in satisfaction and continued to enjoy the footage from the drone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beyond the farmland were houses of various styles arranged in a pleasing manner.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hospitals, clinics, commercial streets, squares, and even several small parks could also be seen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cloe quickly said, "We arranged important facilities such as freshwater purification plants, armories, pharmaceutical factories, and material warehouses underground."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smiled, "Not bad. Perhaps someone will attack us, so it's good to have important facilities underground."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The entire island had turned into a large construction site.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The port was expanded to accommodate cargo ships of ten thousand tons, with towering gantry cranes unloading countless containers and stacking them on the dock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, thousands of dock workers, driving bulldozers and trucks, worked day and night, transporting various construction materials, food, weapons, ammunition, and production equipment to their designated places.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From above, it looked like a dense ant colony diligently building their home.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And Alexander was the emperor of these two islands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander instructed, "Continue to expand the workforce and speed up construction. Don't be afraid to spend money. We need to spend more money to turn the islands into fortresses quickly."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although the development of the two islands was rapidly changing almost daily, Alexander knew that time was still tight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yinson might launch the plan any day now, and the vast majority of humanity would be infected and become living dead or zombies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that time, it would be the end of the world, and these two islands would be Alexander's assurance to protect his family and friends, as well as the last pure land in </span><span>this world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Cloe blushed and asked, "Boss, when are you coming to the island?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing her eager expression, Alexander understood that she was feeling aroused and couldn't help but laugh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I will come over soon to inspect things in person. That would feel more reassuring."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cloe's eyes lit up as she excitedly pumped her fist. "It's a promise. Come as soon as you can. I'll be waiting for you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander looked at Cloe. She was wearing a well-fitted professional outfit today, with the collar of her snow-white shirt unbuttoned, revealing her ample cleavage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The black pencil skirt accentuated her perky and rounded backside, making Alexander look forward to visiting Treasure Island even more.</span></p><div class="pagination">
