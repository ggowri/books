  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll take Ashley to the line first."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava was sensible enough to take Ashley away with her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dad, I'll wait for you. Come on, we're waiting for you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ashley waved at Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava looked mesmerizing as she slowly walked forward, holding Ashley in her arms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She attracted countless stares along the way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Watching Ava's back, Jane asked jealously, "Are you really dating Ava?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander nodded. "That's right. What do you want to talk about?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was impatient and didn't want to talk to Jane much because he would remember bad experiences before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, a man with a scarred face glared at Jane, obviously blaming her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane shivered and hesitantly asked, "My parents wanted to hang out with Ashley, but why did you say no?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander gave the man a look and snorted, "Maybe they weren't there to hang out </span><span>with Ashley. You should know better than I do exactly why, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane and the man look panicked at the same time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing how panicked Jane was, Alexander became even more certain of the Fairfax family's machinations.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He turned around and was going to leave, not bothering to pay attention to Jane because he thought it was more important to spend time with Ashley and Ava.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man came up to Jane's ear and warned menacingly, "Ms. Fairfax, you signed a deal with the Red Umbrella Group, and you had to get Ashley to our institute within a week. Two days have now passed!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane was shaking and stammered, "Mr. Vanderbilt, don't worry. I'll do it..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man eventually fell silent, but he glared at Jane.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane had no choice now. She had signed an agreement, and she received a hundred million dollars. If she didn't follow through on the agreement, the Fairfax family would have to pay a billion dollars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man with the scarred face was Simon Vanderbilt, director of the Red Umbrella Group's </span><span>Loscity</span><span> Institute, and he was there to keep an eye on Jane.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What should she do?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Should she tell Alexander and ask for his help?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, Jane felt confused. She knew something could happen to Ashley if she were sent there, and the Red Umbrella Group was definitely not that kind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Alexander's attitude towards Jane made her feel upset and indescribably lost.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at Alexander and Ava's backs, Simon sneered, "Alexander is so lucky. Ava is so much better than you, no matter her identity, status, appearance or figure."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane was instantly outraged.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Jane, I didn't realize your ex-husband found such a gorgeous woman, she does look better than you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Jane, has he been cheating on you for a long time? He took your money and got a mistress. Damn it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A few young people were talking about this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were all Jane's friends, and they used to look at Alexander differently, thinking he was a loser.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Alexander surprised them by bringing a woman as stunning as Ava.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing the words of the others, Jane looked even angrier and no longer had any thoughts of asking Alexander for help.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava was so fabulous, and she was the president of the Saint Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Alexander dated an ugly girl who was worse than Jane, she would still maintain a sense of superiority, but Ava was so much better than her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, what's so impressive about her? She's just a bitch who will seduce men. When I get a billion dollars and establish a partnership with the Red Umbrella Group, I'll be the richest woman in </span><span>Loscity</span><span>!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane's words shocked those young people.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Jane, are you going to work with the Red Umbrella Group? That's a top company!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Jane, please help us in the future and give us a chance."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They flattered Jane, which instantly made her, who was incredibly vain, feel much better.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane breathed a sigh of relief, straightened her back, and said, "Mr. Vanderbilt, I need to talk to Alexander about taking Ashley away, and I'll be right back in a minute."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Jane strode after Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Simon chuckled, and the ugly scars on his face distorted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He made a phone call. He made a phone call. Then, he turned and hurried toward a nearby building.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane caught up with Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop right there! Didn't you hear me calling you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane was furious. Alexander used to obey her, even if she did something bad, he wouldn't resist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unexpectedly, every dog would have its day. Alexander completely ignored her.</span></p><div class="pagination">
