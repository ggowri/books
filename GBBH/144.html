  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is it... you? Alexander!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lara</span><span> gasped as memories surged back like a flood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh! Did we..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her face flushed with embarrassment, and she could hardly get a word out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only now did </span><span>Lara</span><span> realize her strength was utterly spent. Over an hour of intense passion had left her exhausted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She felt soreness on her chest and other private areas, showing just how intense things had been.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They both remained silent, the room so quiet that </span><span>they can hear the</span><span> heartbeats.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, Alexander broke the silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry. Within six months, I'll help you officially become the head of the Hansen family. Also, I'll give the Hansen family the magic powder distribution rights for </span><span>5</span><span> states. The extra two states are my way of making it up to you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lara</span><span>'s eyes lit up, and she asked suddenly, "Have you ever done it with Ava?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The unexpected question caught Alexander off guard. Why was she asking this out of the blue?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a brief pause, he answered directly, "No, not yet."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You haven't?" </span><span>Lara</span><span> could hardly believe her ears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had only asked out of jealousy, but she never expected Alexander hadn't been with Ava.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Haha, looks like I got ahead!" </span><span>Lara</span><span> burst into a delighted laugh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was speechless. Women are impossible to understand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, </span><span>Lara</span><span>'s expression changed, and she asked cautiously, "What about that wizard?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>During the fight between Alexander and Drake, </span><span>Lara</span><span>'s memory had gone hazy, and she was unaware that Alexander had turned Drake to ash using the Force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Drake and his apprentice Jimbo are both dead." Alexander's tone was calm, but </span><span>Lara</span><span> felt a mix of gratitude, excitement, and deep concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was grateful for Alexander's life-saving help, excited by his incredible strength, and worried about retaliation from the City of Sorcery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alex, could you come over here for a second?" </span><span>Lara</span><span> suddenly called out in a soft voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander shivered. </span><span>Lara</span><span> used to disdain and resent him, but now she was calling him "Alex" and acting coy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Almost automatically, he got up and walked over to the bed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lara</span><span> pulled him close, pressing herself warmly against him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander felt a bit flustered but also responded naturally as any man would.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their previous </span><span>sex</span><span> had been influenced by that bug, but now, </span><span>Lara</span><span> was willingly in his arms, which made a world of difference.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lara</span><span> quickly sensed his reaction, blushing. She glanced down, both afraid and in awe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You really got a big boy down there!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander couldn't help but feel a surge of masculine pride.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lara</span><span> quickly added. "Don't worry, I won't tell Ava about us, but I will compete with her. I want you all to myself!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her declaration left Alexander both amused.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But it was a relief she wouldn't tell Ava. He genuinely didn't know how she'd react if she found out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I was so scared back there, afraid that monster would hurt me..." </span><span>Lara</span><span> suddenly began to cry again, her emotions clearly still unsettled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander gently patted her shoulder, comforting her. "It's over now. He's dead."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you, really!" </span><span>Lara</span><span> wiped her tears, snuggling even closer into his arms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Surviving such a close call and then sharing such passion with Alexander left her exhilarated and hooked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander dared not move. With such an alluring woman in his arms, he could barely control himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even a small movement brought him the delightful sensation of her breasts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unable to contain himself, he cleared his throat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ahem... you should rest. I have important business. Drake is dead, but Sebastian and Evan might flee. I can't let them go."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But I'm scared!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lara</span><span> clung to him even tighter, now seeming like a wife seeking her husband's protection, </span><span>completely different</span><span> from the spoiled and haughty young lady she used to be.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry, I'll have Charlize </span><span>protect</span><span> you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander clapped his hands, and Charlize entered the room, looking conflicted.</span></p><div class="pagination">
