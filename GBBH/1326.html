  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment Alexander saw the bronze warrior freeze up, he bolted down the corridor and made a break for the exit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as he burst through the doorway, a priest guard shouted, "Time's up! One incense stick burned!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The middle-aged guard did a double-take at Alexander. Nobody had ever lasted this long in the corridor, let alone passed the test. "Alexander... you passed!" he announced in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander let out the breath he'd been holding. That had been way too close for comfort, but man, was he relieved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the other candidates watched him with obvious envy, Alexander followed his priest escort toward the back hall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He'd barely left the trial chamber when he ran straight into Ben.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ben stared at Alexander in surprise. "Were you the one testing yourself in the corridor just now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander gave a respectful bow. "Yes, that was me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Go swap out the bronze warrior," Ben instructed the priest soldier and then turned back to Alexander. "I'll take him to meet the Masters."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Right away, Mr. Bonnekamp," the soldier replied before heading back to the main hall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ben led Alexander straight to where the three examiners were seated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Declan, Huxley, Mr. Schneier, this is Alexander," Ben announced. He then leaned in close to Declan and Huxley, whispering something in their ears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander looked up, taking in the three figures before him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The first master was casually fanning himself with a fan, his eyes sparkling with intelligence and a hint of mischief, his expression shifting between amusement and thoughtfulness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The second was built like a tank&mdash;all muscle and raw power, with massive hands gripping a ceremonial ring as he gave Alexander an approving smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The last was clearly a government official, with strong features, thick eyebrows, sharp eyes, and a long beard. He was studying Alexander with obvious interest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Declan lazily fanned himself and smiled. "Not bad at all! You're definitely living up to your reputation as the prodigy who got their Spiritual Awakening from the Head Priest Hezekiah."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Young man, you've got serious potential!" Huxley let out a hearty laugh. "Your natural talent and physical strength are off the charts. You're exactly the kind of recruit we're looking for."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm Fermin Schneier, Minister of the Ministry of Defense for the Hrodvik government." Fermin stroked his long beard as he addressed Alexander. "How would you like to join my personal guard?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though Alexander's heart leaped at the offer, he hesitated. "But what about my training at the Dominion Church's Outer Court..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come on, everyone knows the Dominion Church is great," Fermin cut in with a good-natured scoff. "Don't worry about it. You can focus on your training at the church most of the time. We'd only call you up if there's war. And hey, if you need to prioritize your martial arts training, you can always turn down the call."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then I'm in!" Alexander agreed, figuring that having his name on the military roster wouldn't hurt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, his real goal was to join the Dominion Church's Outer Court and master martial arts before thinking about anything else.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Huxley shot Fermin an annoyed glare. "Hey Schneier, you're pretty quick to snatch up the good ones! As head of the Outer Court, I'm not letting this kid go until he becomes a level-five warrior."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Declan felt a knot in his stomach. He worried that Alexander, young and inexperienced as he was, might rush headlong into battle. It was a decision that would surely end with him coming home in a body bag.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Declan's brow furrowed as he spoke slowly, "Alexander, walking the warrior's path is a one-way street. Once you start, there's no turning back."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander felt his stomach drop. "No turning back?" he thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Life throws eight different kinds of suffering at us," Declan continued. "Birth, aging, sickness, death, separation from loved ones, dealing with people you hate, not getting what you want, and the burning torment of existence itself. Getting stronger and becoming a level-five warrior, even achieving the Diamond Body&mdash;that's not the end goal. True freedom only comes when you break free from the cycle of life and death, when you reach the other shore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Once you're a level-five warrior, you've got to transform your core essence and unlock divine consciousness. Only then can you step into the Divine Transformation State. That's your shot at grasping the Ethereal Mind and claiming the title of Grand Archon. That's what it takes to break free from the cycle&mdash;that's real liberation!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Grand Archon? Break free from the cycle?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's brain was completely fried. This was way more than he'd signed up for.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander had thought being a level-five warrior was hot stuff. He could protect your homeland and slay countless demons.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, he'd heard about the Grand Archons. As someone living in a world of smartphones and social media, his brain just couldn't process it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Declan noticed Alexander zoning out, clearly rattled by everything he'd just learned. Satisfied his words had hit home, he turned to Ben with a slight smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ben, take Alexander to the Outer Court for registration. Tell them..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander forced down the chaos swirling in his gut and said goodbye to the two masters and Fermin. He followed Ben deep into the Outer Court, where they arrived at this absolutely massive mansion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Above the entrance, golden letters spelled out "Martial Virtue Hall".</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inside, they headed straight to the registration office, where staff helped Alexander transfer his credentials.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ben whispered something to this middle-aged clerk in white robes, who shot Alexander a surprised look before pulling out a silver badge and handing it over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ben gave Alexander a respectful bow. "May the God's blessing be with you. Both masters have high hopes for you, Alexander."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he turned and walked away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The clerk was practically bouncing with enthusiasm as he greeted Alexander. "Dude, you've got no idea how special that silver badge is!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
