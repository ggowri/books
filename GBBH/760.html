  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander put on a stern face and said gravely, "Since you won't listen, you can stay here and play with yourself. I'm leaving.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was about to let Rebecca down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No! I'll do whatever you say."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rebecca was genuinely panicked and quickly agreed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She clung tightly to Alexander, her suspended hips writhing desperately to intensify the pleasure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander chuckled. He had only meant to scare her, not expecting her to be so easily frightened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now that she had agreed, everything was settled. Alexander kissed her red lips, tenderly licking and sucking her tongue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Good girl, be obedient. I'll carry you over. You and Ava are so close. Her mother won't mind. We're all family. Wouldn't it be nice if we were all happy together?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander always used a hard-soft approach with Rebecca, and it worked like a charm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rebecca was well aware that she couldn't live without Alexander. No matter what he asked her to do, she was willing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though she was shy and a bit reluctant now, she dared not resist. She feared Alexander's anger and wanted to please him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the master bedroom, Lynn had already changed Ava's position.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava was wearing a revealing mini-dress. Lynn was beside her, nibbling and sucking on her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, footsteps were heard from outside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lynn and Ava froze, their expressions extremely flustered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If someone saw them, they would be utterly mortified.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava covered her chest, trembling as she asked, "Is someone coming?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lynn was initially flustered but suddenly laughed, pinching Ava's chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My silly girl, it must be Alexander. No one else can get in here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava immediately relaxed, her face flushing red. She didn't know how to explain the current situation to Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was indeed Alexander who entered, and he was carrying a completely naked woman with big breasts and wide hips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The woman was tightly hugging Alexander's neck, her legs wrapped around his waist, her plump buttocks fiercely battling the "dragon".</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With each step Alexander took, the "dragon" would attack, causing Rebecca to gasp.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Ava recognized the woman, she was stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Rebecca, is that you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ava... Lynn, I'm sorry. Alexander insisted I come..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rebecca was both embarrassed and annoyed, and the waves of pleasure were making her cry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lynn also stared blankly at Rebecca. She never expected Alexander to bring Ava's best friend over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, it was the first time she had met Rebecca naked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing the shocked expression on Lynn's face, Rebecca's sense of shame and pleasure peaked simultaneously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She hugged Alexander with all her strength, shivering uncontrollably.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander took the opportunity to lay her down on the bed, grasped her with both hands, and quickened his movements.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rebecca, overwhelmed by the pleasure, opened her mouth wide and fainted from pleasure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander patted Rebecca's cheek. Seeing no response, he smiled triumphantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He crooked his finger at Ava and Lynn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My big darling and little darling. You two are having so much fun without me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lynn glared at him, annoyed. "Who are you talking to?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander immediately found amusement in it. Lynn was quite jealous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He pushed Lynn onto the bed and leaned in for a kiss.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lynn moaned loudly. Playing with Ava earlier had already ignited her desire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She felt empty and needed to be fiercely filled by Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No electric toy could compare to Alexander. He was not only thick and straight but also warm, unlike the cold toys.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Lynn's alluring appearance, Alexander knew what she was looking forward to.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come on!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had Lynn lie flat and pulled Ava, who was watching the scene, over to Lynn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their ample bosoms pressed tightly together, creating enticing waves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The plump buttocks were even more tempting. Two beautiful, dewy secret gardens tempted Alexander to delve deeper.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The "dragon" struck directly, unimpeded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander felt like a sovereign ruler, able to do as he pleased, freely entering any secret garden he desired.</span></p><div class="pagination">
