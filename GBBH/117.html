  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander spent the entire night meticulously preparing the magic powder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava came looking for him. She knocked on his door, but there was no answer. When he didn't come to find her either, Ava stormed off in a huff.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the upcoming conference, tension gripped </span><span>Loscity</span><span>. Factions from all over had gathered here, each waiting for the right moment to make their move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Betty spared no expense by renting out </span><span>Loscity's</span><span> convention center as the venue for the gathering.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The event hadn't even started, yet crowds had already gathered around the venue, and luxury cars filled the streets.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Two hours before the event began, the parking lot was packed with high-end cars like supercars, Rolls-Royces, and Bentleys, all signaling that the guests in attendance were far from ordinary.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Alexander arrived in his old, battered Toyota, it drew scoffs and contemptuous glances.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the midst of all the luxury vehicles, that beat-up Toyota looked wildly out of place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Near the entrance, two groups were locked in a standoff.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On one side stood men from the Brilliant Group. Each of them was burly, clad in matching black suits and sunglasses, towering like sentinels.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Opposite them was a line of Hansen family men, just as large and intimidating in their matching attire, exuding a tense, aggressive energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In total, there were hundreds on both sides, and the atmosphere was charged with tension.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's going on? The conference hasn't even started, and the Brilliant Group is already at odds with the Hansen family?" someone murmured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sebastian and Orion are both claiming exclusive distribution rights for the magic powder. They each say they have Mr. Gellar's authorization," another replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is going to be interesting. Is that even possible?" someone asked, intrigued.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Where is Mr. Gellar anyway? This could turn into a fight. We should keep our distance," someone cautioned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd murmured excitedly, watching the spectacle unfold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Orion snapped angrily, "Sebastian, what is the meaning of this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian calmly pulled out a contract.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Orion, I signed a deal with Mr. Gellar and even paid a forty-million-dollar deposit. What about you? Do you have any proof?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Orion froze. He had given Jackson a twenty-million-dollar deposit but hadn't signed a contract. Panic spread across his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Orion's reaction, Sebastian let out a triumphant laugh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, his expression turned cold as he waved his hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"For anyone who dares obstruct the Brilliant Group's operations, we will kill them on the spot!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Over a hundred men in black roared in unison. Their cries sent chills through everyone present.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd knew well that the chairman of the Brilliant Group, Guzman, was a </span><span>ruthless drug lord.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And behind Guzman was a Godfather known as "Reaper," a figure who had instilled terror in countless people. No one dared to cross him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the support of the magic powder creator, Sebastian's power was formidable, and now, as the exclusive distributor, the Brilliant Group's influence would only grow stronger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The resounding roar of his men, like the terrifying howls of wild beasts, made Orion's courage falter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That damned Jackson...he dared to cheat me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cursing, Orion finally backed down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without the exclusive rights to magic powder, the Hansen family had no way of standing up to the Brilliant Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a smug grin, Sebastian announced, "Anyone interested in becoming a magic powder distributor, line up here and place your deposit."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Immediately, a long line formed before him. People pushed and jostled, desperate to get closer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Someone questioned, "Mr. Tate, wasn't Betty in charge of selling the magic powder? When did the Brilliant Group take over as the exclusive distributor?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian scoffed disdainfully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What do you know? Betty is just a sales rep under Mr. Gellar. Now that he's granted me the exclusive rights, the business is mine to handle."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This statement only deepened the crowd's belief. As the Brilliant Group's president, Sebastian wouldn't lie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone understood that even the smallest role as a magic powder distributor could yield massive profits.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Cripples, the Blood Gang, the Kaylon, various powerful families, and even Orion hesitated. The prospect of joining the line was tempting, and they, too, were considering stepping forward.</span></p><div class="pagination">
