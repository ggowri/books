A capable man like Alexander is indeed the best husband for every woman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you can be together, you will really be a perfect match. What a pity!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elaina asked expectantly, "Dad, why do you say it's a pity?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Orlando said very seriously, "I just asked someone to check the information about Alexander. He is a famous figure in </span><span>Loscity</span><span>, and he is the developer of magic powder and beauty ointments. His girlfriend is the president of the Saint Group!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A man like him might be out of our league."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Really? He's so amazing, and his girlfriend is the president of a billionaire group."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The blush on Elaina's pretty face immediately disappeared, and she turned pale.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She said to herself, "His girlfriend must be very outstanding. Otherwise, she wouldn't be the president of a billionaire group..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Orlando could only sigh secretly at the sight of her distraught look.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the hotel, Alexander had already fed the Kaylon Pill to Ashley.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her face was painted with several mysterious symbols, painted with Nancy's blood, which were said to attract the blessing of the dragon god.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The dragon bone fragment had turned into powder, and the essence had been absorbed by the Kaylon Pill.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander waited quietly, and Rosalia stood obediently beside him. They were both nervous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brittany still had company matters to deal with, so she didn't show up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosalia asked cautiously, "Master, will the Kaylon Pill be effective?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander glanced at the dragon bone fragment, pondered for a while, and </span><span>said</span><span>. "It is very likely to be effective. I hope Ashley can recover.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey! There's a change!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was suddenly surprised.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His All-seeing Eyes could see the changes taking place in Ashley's body. The cells that had been damaged by the genetic serum were repairing and regenerating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The cells that had become unstable due to genetic damage stabilized at a very rapid </span><span>rate and became healthier and stronger.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The change happened silently and quickly in Ashley's body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Nancy didn't lie to me. The Kaylon Pill is really effective. Ashley can recover."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander waved his fists excitedly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosalia hugged him and cried with joy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Ashley was not her child, the cute little girl had already captured everyone's hearts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a full hour, she finally opened her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her eyes were big, round, and extremely clear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Daddy!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ashley jumped up and hugged Alexander tightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Daddy, I thought I would never see you again."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How could that be? Ashley, you will always be with me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander comforted Ashley, tears welling up in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She nodded obediently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, I will always be with you and listen to you. When I meet Ava, she will definitely praise me for being a good child."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ashley, you are sweet!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander kissed Ashley on the cheek affectionately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He discovered that her physical functions had greatly improved. Although it was not obvious now, when she grew up, her speed and strength would definitely surpass those of ordinary humans.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was all the power of the Kaylon Pill, and it was thanks to Nancy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was filled with emotion, and his eyes grew deep.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ashley, I swear that I will never let anyone hurt you again!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Felix, you are doomed!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
