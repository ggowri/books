  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Samuel forcefully shoved Nick aside.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You absolute fool! You're fired effective immediately! If Mr. Hawthorne decides to pursue legal action for your public discrimination and personal insults, our bank will fully cooperate."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nick was left completely flabbergasted, at a loss for what to do next.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He mused, "What gives Alexander the right to be a diamond VIP? How on earth did that happen?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Is that old bat hiding something? Could she really be a billionaire and left everything to him? Over 100 million dollars&mdash;damn it!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Not only did Alexander get me fired, but he also swiped the fortune that should've been mine!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander didn't feel the need to waste any more breath on Nick. To him, Nick was nothing but a cockroach scuttling on the ground.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If it weren't for Lily, he could've made one phone call to have Nick dealt with.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With a broad smile plastered across his face, Samuel turned to Alexander.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mr. Hawthorne, I sincerely apologize for this incident. We'll get to the bottom of it. You came to withdraw money, right? Allow me to assist you personally."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Samuel ushered Alexander into a private VIP room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nick watched in utter disbelief, his expression darkening further by the second.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Just wait, Alexander. I'll find a way to reclaim what's rightfully mine."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Hey!" Nick was suddenly jolted by a hefty pat on the shoulder.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He jumped and glared at the security guard. "What do you want?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The guard shoved him again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You're no longer an employee here. Please exit the premises and stop interrupting our business."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nick felt his vision blur with rage.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He was used to barking orders at security, never expecting to be treated like this himself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mr. Portman, take care of yourself. I know jobs are tough to come by, but with your skills, you'll land something better," one colleague chimed in.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yeah, Mr. Portman, want us to throw you a farewell party?" another added, the glee barely concealed in his voice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nick, who had always been harsh and demanding with his colleagues, could see their delight. The happiness in their eyes only fueled his fury.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Damn you, Alexander! I'll make sure I get back what's mine!" he roared, dumping all the blame on Alexander.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">An hour later, Alexander arrived at the retirement home, carrying a bag filled with cash.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As he entered James' room, everything remained untouched, just as it had been the day James departed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander slowly sank into the couch, gazing at the rocking chair James used to love.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">For a moment, it felt as if the gentle old man was still there, sitting in the chair with his eyes closed and a faint smile on his face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Sunlight poured through the window, casting warm light on the scene, while the rocking chair swayed gently as if beckoning him to remember.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Unconsciously, Alexander lost track of time, spending hours in the quiet comfort of that room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When he finally stepped out of the retirement home, he felt different&mdash;somehow renewed, as if he had undergone a cleansing. A refreshing sense of clarity washed over Alexander, and he sensed that his connection to the Force had deepened, too.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A smile broke across his face. The trials of the heart were as crucial to a Warrior's strength as any battle fought; they were an essential part of growth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At the entrance of the villa, Ava was waiting for Alexander to return home.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Emma couldn't help but ask, "Ms. Blackburn, when you are negotiating with the Hansen family, why do you insist that Alexander attend?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava flashed a knowing smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Tomorrow marks the day of the magic powder exchange conference. Sebastian will undoubtedly pull out all the stops to snag the formula for the magic powder.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"While the Saint Group might not be in the magic powder business, we absolutely cannot let Sebastian get his hands on it!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"That's why we're teaming up with the Kaylon and the Hansen family and bringing Alexander into the mix. Even if Sebastian manages to strike a deal with the Cripples and the Blood Gang, he still won't stand a chance at securing the formula.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Alexander is an indispensable asset; his strength is unmatched in the Saint Group, and honestly, I'd say he's among the best in all of Loscity."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Emma raised an eyebrow, skeptical.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Is he really that tough in a fight? I can't see it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava let out a dismissive huff.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You came in too late to witness what he's capable of. As long as Alexander is on our side, we can keep Sebastian in check."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Emma nodded thoughtfully, then shook her head.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She hadn't seen Alexander in action, so it was hard for her to believe. It felt like Ava was seeing him through rose-colored glasses, overestimating his abilities.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When Alexander finally returned to the villa, Ava had been waiting for quite a while.</p><div class="pagination">
