  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The middle-aged man was dressed in luxurious robes, his head adorned with a silver crown. He sat in a grand rosewood armchair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a broad, rugged face and piercing eyes, his expression was dark and unreadable. His skin was unnaturally pale and flawless. Looking at him, one could sense the boundless power and authority he wielded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wherever he sat, an invisible pressure followed, making it impossible for others to meet his gaze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was Madden Wetherall, the man second only to the emperor in the Hrodvik Empire. A hereditary Duke Protector, Supreme Commander of the military, and a fifth-level warrior standing at the very peak of martial prowess on the continent of Sahasia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Madden slapped on the armrest and sprang to his feet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A loud crack echoed through the hall. The seemingly indestructible rosewood chair shattered into pieces, fragments scattering across the floor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Enough with the racket!" Madden roared. "You need to discipline Julius as well. Princess Isolde is one thing, but Jeffrey Dewey has gone too far. I'll make him pay someday."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Madden's fury, the beautiful woman fell silent and replied cautiously, "Madden, what about those two rogues?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Madden said, "Tell Finn to send out more men tomorrow to find them. I want them dealt with harshly."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you, Madden. Would you like me to attend to you tonight?" The woman knelt before him, her eyes filled with desire. She provocatively swayed her ample bosom and shapely hips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Madden's expression softened. He scooped her up into his arms and headed towards the inner chambers, leaving behind a trail of laughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Hrodvik Palace was ablaze with lights. The Rectitude Hall was a place where Quinton reviewed the official documents.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, a middle-aged man and a young girl were chatting casually on the bed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The middle-aged man was the Eternal Emperor, Quinton Kingsley. He wore a golden crown with a luminous pearl radiating at its center and was clad in a bright, luxurious robe. The robe was embroidered with a pattern of dragons soaring across the seas.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinton arched his eyebrows, his pupils shimmered warmly, and his nose bridge was straight and high. He exuded a vibe of majesty and nobility. A sage emperor who shook the world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The young girl was slender, wearing a white, floor-length dress adorned with blossoms. A light pink brocade wrapped around her ample bosoms. The hem of her dress was a thin layer of gauze as light as mist, and a golden belt was tied around her waist, making her appear elegant and luxurious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had an oval face with delicate features. Her eyes were bright, her nose was exquisite, and her rosy lips seemed to be dripping with moisture. She was none other than the white-clad youth who had argued with Julius.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinton stroked the girl's head and said, "Isolde, why did you go out and cause trouble for no reason? You should bring a few more guards with you next time."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isolde's eyes flashed with cunning. She grabbed Quinton's hand and acted coquettish. "Father, the world is now peaceful, and the country is prosperous. I've been having a great time every time I go out! And I've changed into scholar's attire. It's just that Julius was being insufferable. Father, you must punish him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinton sighed and said slowly, "Madden is good in every way, but Julius is his only son, so it's inevitable that he's a bit spoiled. I heard that Julius had his butt beaten to a pulp by Jeffrey today. Shouldn't that be enough to cool your temper?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isolde laughed. "He deserved it! I haven't asked him to compensate me for my Rejuvenation Pill yet."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinton said, "Rejuvenation Pill? Your mother especially asked for that from the Dominion Church for you. It can bring the dead back to life and help people break through the limits of martial arts."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, it is. He was injured while saving me, so I had to save him. At that time..." Isolde's eyes sparkled. She gestured and explained to Quinton what had happened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinton replied, "Oh? A teenager? A mere level-one warrior managing to withstand a strike from a level-three expert? Not bad. He's either trained by a renowned teacher or a martial prodigy."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for Alexander, ever since he was defeated with a single blow, he knew that there was always someone better out there and that he was nothing special. After returning to Emerald Manor, he was determined to improve himself, practicing martial arts even more diligently every day.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Time flew.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Dominion Church lay disciples selection is tomorrow, but I haven't even reached level-two warrior yet!" Alexander was anxious. His heart was heavy. He guessed the mysterious white-clothed youth's green pill miraculously enhanced the Force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ever since Alexander swallowed the pill, the efficiency of his daily practice of the Muscle-Tendon Classic to gather energy and form the Force had increased significantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His Force was advancing by leaps and bounds, and the Force mass in his core was already the size of a date, forming a constantly rotating Force vortex.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Judging by the sheer power of this vortex, Alexander should have long broken through to level-two warrior, perhaps even reached its peak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And yet, when it came to mastering the balance of hardness and softness, there seemed to be an invisible barrier, a thin veil he just couldn't pierce through.</span></p><div class="pagination">
