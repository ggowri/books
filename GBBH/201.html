  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They never wanted to experience that terrifying pain again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander nodded in satisfaction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Among the senior members was a bald, overweight man who suddenly stood up after thinking for a moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne, I'm Miguel Federer, responsible for the Federer family's accounts. I'd like to introduce you to our family's industries and specific situations."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He then spoke confidently, detailing the Federer family's key industries and annual net profits clearly and precisely to Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander patted him on the shoulder, wanting to reward this flatterer a bit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Very well. I think Miguel is a talent for the Federer family; he will continue to manage the family's accounts. For general matters, you can decide with Edward without needing to tell me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you, Mr. Hawthorne, thank you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Miguel immediately lit up with joy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although he previously managed the accounts, he was doing all the hard labor and held the lowest status among them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Who would have thought that a little flattery would elevate his position to be on par with Edward, allowing him to influence the Federer family's affairs? He truly turned misfortune into fortune.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The other senior members of the Federer family turned pale with anger; though they felt resentment, they were also envious of Miguel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander watched all of this with a quiet smirk.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Whether it was making Edward the agent or pairing Miguel with Edward, it was essentially to divide the Federer family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By encouraging infighting within the Federer family, Alexander could reap the benefits until they became completely reliant on him, and then let the Ultimate Alliance fully absorb the Federer family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"From now on, everyone should cooperate well. If anyone behaves like Gary again, I will show them what hell on earth looks like."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's sharp gaze swept over them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instantly, everyone felt uneasy, with cold sweat dripping down their foreheads and backs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They secretly rejoiced in their survival but felt an overwhelming sense of resentment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, thinking of Alexander's methods and seeing Miguel and Edward fawning over him, their anger seemed futile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With these two sycophants, the Federer family was doomed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander waved at Edward. "Come here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Edward froze for two seconds, then obediently bowed his head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander patted him on the shoulder, a hint of the Force hidden within him that hadn't yet activated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Edward sensed something vaguely and trembled in fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Remember, if you help me well, I won't let it activate. Otherwise, you'll end up like those guys did, in unimaginable pain."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Edward felt a chill all over, as if he were in an ice cavern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is this sorcery?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Or is it the Deadly Hex from </span><span>Soutaxia</span><span>?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Or is it the innate martial arts that my master mentioned, which are rarely seen in the world?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Edward's face turned ashen. He had once thought about finding an opportunity to kill Alexander, but now he was completely convinced.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne, don't worry. I'm willing to follow your orders."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander checked the time; it was already five o'clock, and the sky was beginning to lighten.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm leaving. If anything comes up, have Edward contact me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Miguel quickly nodded and bowed, seeing him off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The other members of the Federer family also smiled broadly as they sent Alexander off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne, Mr. Hawthorne, please wait a moment."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, Edward swiftly rushed to Gary's corpse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He searched through Gary's belongings and pulled out a golden bank card.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne, this is a gold card that Gary obtained privately. It contains all his savings. He set a fingerprint password, and I saw him using it for transactions."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Edward picked up a fruit knife and decisively cut off Gary's right index finger, wrapping it in several layers of paper, then respectfully handed it to Alexander along with the bank card.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander looked at the gold card; it sparkled brilliantly and required a transaction volume of over a billion to obtain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only those who owned such a card were true top-tier wealthy individuals, more prestigious than Alexander's diamond VIP status.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing that Edward had taken the lead, Miguel quickly flattered Alexander to take credit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne, I know what assets Gary has. Since he has been expelled from the family, he no longer has the right to enjoy these assets.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And since you are now the Chief Elder of our Federer family, you are qualified and entitled to manage these assets. I will send you all the information tomorrow."</span></p><div class="pagination">
