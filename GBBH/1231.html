  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Karson scanned the area, his face dark with worry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Louvian</span><span> Port was barely recognizable now. They'd built container walls on every side except the oceanfront.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The barriers stood about </span><span>30 feet</span><span> high, with three containers stacked on top of each other, and they'd set up firing positions along the top.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There had to be at least several hundred Sunrise Group workers and armed guards </span><span>stationed around the perimeter. Each one was packing an assault rifle, and aside from running low on ammo, one would think that would be enough firepower to stop any wild animal in its tracks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But everyone was on edge, weapons at the ready like they were bracing for hell itself to break loose.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Karson turned to his lieutenant, worry etched across his face. "This mutation in the wildlife&mdash;it's got to be connected to that living dead incident in </span><span>Loscity</span><span>. We've been trapped here for three days now. Without military backup, we're not going to last much longer."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His lieutenant nodded. "Mr. Chapman, we got lucky that our port was well-stocked. Plus, we've got those weapons the Saint Group was shipping to Treasure Island. That should help us hold the line.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The way these animals mutated&mdash;it came out of nowhere, and now they're moving in these massive, terrifying hordes."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Karson furrowed his brow, mentally running through a list of who might be able to help them out of this mess.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All the cell towers in the area had been destroyed, leaving their phones dead&mdash;completely cut off from the outside world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beyond the port area, the residential districts of </span><span>Louvian</span><span> had completely fallen. The poor residents were being hunted and devoured by these mutated beasts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"God help us all. Is this some kind of divine punishment?" Karson had lost all hope at this point.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the Ultimate Alliance headquarters, a blood-soaked man stood before Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The guy was in rough shape&mdash;his tactical gear was shredded, and his body was covered in deep gashes. Some of the wounds were already turning black.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What the hell went down at </span><span>Louvian</span><span> Port? How did we lose all our supplies?" Alexander's face was grim as he questioned the man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Augusta and his team had been busy with their meditation training lately, so they hadn't been leading the supply runs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead, they'd picked some of their most capable and loyal captains to lead the convoys, moving supplies to </span><span>Louvian</span><span> before shipping them out to Treasure Island.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Boss, it's a total nightmare over there," the man reported. "These animals... they've mutated into something else. They're forming massive hordes and hunting people down like prey. </span><span>Louvian</span><span> Port is about to fall."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He took a breath before continuing. "Karson&mdash;you know, the CEO of Sunrise Group&mdash;he's managed to pull his people together and set up some kind of defensive line. They're holding the port for now, but honestly?" He shook his head. "I don't think they can keep it up much longer."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The soldier had fought his way back here, and now he was shaking like a leaf as he gasped out his report, completely drained from the ordeal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We were short on ammo and guns... I'm the only one who made it back. Everyone else... they're all dead."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mutated beasts? A horde?" Alexander's already grim expression turned even darker.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew exactly what this meant. It had to be part of the Yinson</span><span>&rsquo;</span><span>s</span><span> Apocalypse Project. First, they'd tested zombie control in </span><span>Loscity</span><span>, and now they were experimenting with mutated animals in </span><span>Louvian</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's gut told him that Yinson targeting </span><span>Louvian</span><span> Port was a direct attack against him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He'd invested billions of dollars in supplies, production facilities, and weapons&mdash;all of which had to go through </span><span>Louvian</span><span> Port to reach Treasure Island and Devil Island.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After months of effort, he'd only managed to get two-thirds of the supplies to the islands. There was still a massive amount of equipment and resources waiting to be transported.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander couldn't even let himself think about what would happen if </span><span>Louvian</span><span> Port was destroyed. Yinson had really hit him where it hurt. They were trying to cut off his supply line completely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tell me more about these mutated beasts," Alexander pressed, leaning forward. "What exactly are we dealing with here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Everything around </span><span>Louvian</span><span> has gone completely wild. We're talking about every animal you can think of mutating. From rats and sparrows to wolves and foxes, even the lions and tigers at the zoo. Nothing's been spared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"All those house pets&mdash;you know how many folks in </span><span>Louvian</span><span> had cats and dogs? Well, those family pets turned into something straight out of a nightmare. They're as vicious as any wild predator now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But all these mutated creatures seem to be working together somehow. It's like they've developed some kind of intelligence, or maybe someone's pulling their strings behind the scenes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's all I managed to find out. I had to fight my way back through hell to get here... My friends didn't make it. I lost every single one of them on that road."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The big guy's voice cracked as tears rolled down his cheeks.</span></p><div class="pagination">
