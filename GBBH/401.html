I promise you won't regret it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander extended an official invitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mary was shocked and astonished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, you're the mastermind behind the Ultimate Alliance! I thought it was some mysterious tycoon, but it's you. How are you so capable?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was smitten with Alexander. He was impressive both in and out of the bedroom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's go; time to head back."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander grinned as he scooped Mary up and carried her out of the meeting room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mary's face was flushed as she pleaded, "You can't ever leave me.
