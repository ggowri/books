  <div class="container"><p style="text-align:left;">Stephen didn&#x27;t even spare Alexander a glance. To him, Alexander seemed utterly ordinary, and his calm demeanor was mistaken for sheer fright.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Without releasing his internal energy, Alexander looked just like anyone else.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Karson gritted his teeth and shouted, &quot;Stephen, stop being so arrogant. Let&#x27;s see who&#x27;s stronger after a fight!&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Stephen grinned mockingly. &quot;You want to take me on? You&#x27;re all just a bunch of losers!&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Who the hell are you calling a loser?&quot; Dariel snapped, his temper flaring.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Unable to hold back, he pointed at Stephen and declared, &quot;I&#x27;ve heard you&#x27;re the top expert in Sakra Society. I&#x27;ll take you down right now and show you what I&#x27;m made of!&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">With that, Dariel launched a punch.</p><p style="text-align:left;">As expected from a boxing champion&#x27;s disciple, his movements were exceptionally slick as he charged at Stephen.</p><p style="text-align:left;">He threw a powerful punch that created a fierce gust of wind, his fist flying toward Stephen&#x27;s cheek with lethal speed.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Having knocked out dozens of opponents and faced countless life-and-death situations in underground fights, Dariel was confident in his boxing skills.</p><p style="text-align:left;">He launched a surprise attack, disregarding any sense of fair play, simply aiming to eliminate Stephen quickly and claim the promised 30-million-dollar bonus from Karson.</p><p style="text-align:left;">In a fight, the winner took all, and morality or rules didn&#x27;t matter—victory was everything.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Against Dariel&#x27;s sudden assault, Stephen remained unfazed, a sinister smile creeping across his face, completely dismissing Dariel&#x27;s threat.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Loser,&quot; he said coldly.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Before Dariel could even process Stephen&#x27;s words, Stephen unsheathed a saber in a flash.</p><p style="text-align:left;">The blade gleamed ominously, slicing through the air with a chilling whistle, and a wave of icy menace sent chills down everyone&#x27;s spines.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Except for Alexander, no one saw how quickly Stephen drew his blade.</p><p style="text-align:left;">In the blink of an eye, Dariel screamed in agony and staggered back, blood spraying like a fountain.</p><p style="text-align:left;">As everyone looked closer, they realized Dariel&#x27;s right hand had been severed, lying on the ground while his fingers quivered slowly.</p><p style="text-align:left;">His face contorted in horror, his eyes wide as he grasped his right wrist with his left hand, staring at Stephen in disbelief.</p><p style="text-align:left;">If he hadn&#x27;t retreated fast enough, the blade would have taken not just his hand but his entire arm.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Dariel stumbled back several steps, his face ashen, utterly robbed of any fighting spirit.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;So fast...&quot; he stammered, fear stripping him of strength as blood poured from his wound.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Loser. I could kill you like squashing an insect!&quot; Stephen sneered, pointing the saber toward the ground. Drops of crimson blood dripped from the blade, pooling on the floor.</p><p style="text-align:left;">The metallic scent of blood filled the hall, both pungent and terrifying.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Travis furrowed his brow and asked, &quot;What level of metahuman are you? Do you possess speed power? Otherwise, you couldn&#x27;t have moved that fast!&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Stephen wasn&#x27;t just a metahuman with speed; his swordsmanship was fierce and precise, a renowned martial art emphasizing quick draws and immediate strikes.</p><p style="text-align:left;">The technique he employed was said to be capable of severing a bull&#x27;s head in one strike—an incredibly powerful sword move.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Dariel hadn&#x27;t anticipated Stephen&#x27;s prowess. He had cut through Dariel&#x27;s hand with the same ease a chef uses to chop a chicken wing.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;What&#x27;s wrong? Scared? Losers!&quot; Stephen scoffed.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Cesar and Travis fumed at being insulted as losers.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Karson glanced at them and declared firmly, &quot;I&#x27;ll double the reward if you can get rid of Stephen!&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Cesar and Travis exchanged excited glances.</p><p style="text-align:left;">But they knew that facing Stephen alone was a fool&#x27;s errand.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Dariel had just attempted a surprise attack and had lost an arm for his troubles; neither of them had the strength to match Stephen.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Cesar licked his lips, his heart racing.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Travis&#x27; small eyes were now wide open as he scrutinized Stephen.</p><p style="text-align:left;">The two men radiated an intimidating, murderous presence as they scrutinized Stephen, searching for any weaknesses, ready to change the tide of battle.</p><div class="pagination">
