  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marvin quickly chimed in, "Boss, if you take us with you, we won't slow you down, I promise."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A warm feeling washed over Alexander; it was good to know he had such loyal buddies by his side.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, we'll go together. The rest of you listen to Betty's orders. William will stay here to keep watch and prevent any surprises."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, Logan's eyelids fluttered, and his fingers twitched slightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, he opened his eyes, and the first face he saw was Alexander's.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Boss, I thought I was a goner... but I'm still here... thank you for saving me..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A faint smile broke across Logan's pale face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The room erupted in excitement, and Alexander couldn't help but beam back at Logan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But then Logan's expression darkened, a fierce glint flashing in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Boss, I didn't let them take the magic powder. I swear I'll make them pay for this!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Easy there, Logan. You're hurt and need to rest. The Fraternity's mess is my responsibility now. Just focus on getting better."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His gaze was filled with resolve; vengeance could only be cleansed with the blood of their enemies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thanks, Boss. Just be careful out there," Logan said, managing a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought to himself, "Messing with the Ultimate Alliance? They're asking for trouble. Those fools from the Fraternity don't know what they're up against."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After chatting for a bit, Logan's exhaustion caught up with him, and he drifted back into a deep sleep.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander instructed the others to keep the room secure before stepping out of the hospital ward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Boss, I've gathered all the intel on the Fraternity. I'm sending it over now," Augusta said, pulling up a document on his device.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Great, let's take a look."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander opened the file and quickly scanned the contents.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew that even a lion used all its strength to catch a rabbit; he couldn't afford to underestimate his opponents. Understanding the enemy was half the battle, especially since the Fraternity was a major player in </span><span>Loscity</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their leader, Ian Oldman, was regarded as a formidable figure in many circles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was determined to strike hard and uproot the Fraternity, leaving no chance for retaliation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The document spanned dozens of pages, but Alexander's sharp mind absorbed the information effortlessly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was surprised at how quickly he could recall everything, the key points flashing vividly in his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As his power grew, Alexander's abilities as a Warrior expanded, including an almost photographic memory. He was brimming with anticipation for the future.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Boss, is there something wrong with the intel? You finished that pretty fast," Augusta asked, a hint of confusion in his voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, all good. We'll hit the Fraternity's hideout tonight at the Magic Bar and take them down along with Ian," Alexander replied decisively.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's go in and wipe them out completely!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Augusta and Marvin were practically buzzing with anticipation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the clock struck ten, the Magic Bar was buzzing with activity, the peak of its nightlife.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>People streamed in and out, a mix of men and women, the atmosphere thick with excitement and a haze of smoke.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The pounding music rattled eardrums, overwhelming anyone not accustomed to the chaos.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Colorful laser lights danced across the room, illuminating the crowd as they waved glow sticks, lost in the rhythm of the night.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander noticed that nearly everyone had a blue drink in hand, which was undoubtedly spiked with magic powder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The magic powder undeniably provided an intense rush.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The three of them found a vacant table, ordered a few bottles, and settled in to observe their surroundings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Ultimate Alliance had mobilized fifty members, who were discreetly surrounding both entrances of the bar, waiting for Alexander's signal to close in and trap the Fraternity members inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Augusta leaned </span><span>in,</span><span> his expression serious. "Boss, even though Ian comes here regularly, do you think he might skip out tonight after they just attacked our headquarters?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander gave a composed smile. "If Ian truly respected us, he wouldn't have dared to storm our headquarters."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marvin fumed, saying, "We must dismantle the Fraternity! Let everyone in </span><span>Loscity</span><span> understand that touching our magic powder comes at a steep price&mdash;their lives!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Take it easy, there's still plenty of time," Alexander assured, confident in his prediction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He mused, "Once a habit is ingrained, it's hard to break. Ian will come.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Fraternity disregards both me and the Ultimate Alliance so blatantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If they didn't, they wouldn't have dared to amass over a hundred goons for such a grand assault."</span></p><div class="pagination">
