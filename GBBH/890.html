A real assassin doesn't waste words."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shadow's eyes burned with rage, and he wanted nothing more than to tear this bastard to pieces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He quickly searched Flame's body and found the antidote, swallowing it immediately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Swish!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shadow sliced off Flame's head, grabbed it, and ran toward Marvin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Huh, that useless Flame got himself killed."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A flash of lightning illuminated Shadow as he emerged from the darkness, bleeding heavily and holding Flame's severed head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Flame's lifeless eyes were wide open, filled with disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Locke's expression turned grim, his gaze fierce and cruel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marvin was overjoyed and quickly ran to join Shadow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Shadow's limp right arm with blood still flowing freely, Marvin frowned. It was clear Shadow had lost most of his fighting strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're too badly hurt..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Relieved to see Marvin unharmed, Shadow's tightly strung nerves eased a little.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry, the boss will be here soon..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, Marvin pressed an assault rifle against Shadow's head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shadow was shocked and furious. "What are you doing?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marvin's face was filled with pain and struggle, his strong body trembling violently as though resisting an invisible force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marvin stammered, "It's not me... They're trying to force me to pull the trigger..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he explained, he fought to move the barrel away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shadow quickly dodged, putting some distance between them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the shadows, the woman had closed her eyes, her hands outstretched toward Marvin as if manipulating him from afar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Welsh, that man is too strong. I can't fully control him or hold him for long. Hurry and finish this..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Locke nodded. "Your binding ability has improved&mdash;very impressive!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He turned to Marvin and Shadow, his fierce gaze brimming with murderous intent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shadow roared, "Marvin! Fight off her control and unleash your full strength. Hurry, you can do it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I order you to kill him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The woman's sharp voice pierced the air, screeching like an owl.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blood streamed from Marvin's eyes, yet he refused to give in. His face contorted in pain as he struggled to break free of her control.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I command you to shoot!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The woman continued her furious shouting, unwilling to give up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marvin's body trembled violently, blood now dripping from his eyes, nose, and mouth. Yet, he still refused to pull the trigger on Shadow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Locke chuckled coldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Impressively stubborn. Looks like I'll have to handle this myself."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He suddenly vanished into the shadows, followed by the eerie sound of a whistle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A rustling sound filled the air as countless venomous snakes slithered out of the forest, closing in on Marvin and Shadow under the whistle's command.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The mass of snakes flicked their tongues, all of them king cobras.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shadow and Marvin now understood why there were no guards on their way here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With so many cobras around, anyone foolish enough to intrude would surely be bitten to death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hiss!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The cobras lunged at them, some with their hoods flared, spraying venom in their direction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The snakes and their venom surrounded them, leaving Shadow and Marvin with no escape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shadow's face turned pale. Already gravely injured, he was powerless against such a dire situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Death was closing in!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that moment, Marvin's vision blurred, and everything around him seemed to freeze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sound of rain falling surrounded him, the cobras closing in, venom already raining down from above.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No! I can't die! Even if I die, I won't let Shadow die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marvin gritted his teeth, determined to break free from the powerful force holding him back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The attempt to force him to kill Shadow was unforgivable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marvin roared furiously, his heartbeat surging, blood pumping faster than ever.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A medical exam at that moment would reveal Marvin's adrenaline levels skyrocketing to dozens of times the normal amount.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adrenaline surged through his body, unleashing unimaginable strength.</span></p><div class="pagination">
