He was undoubtedly a master, yet Alexander had sent him flying with a single punch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The wall even cracked like that. Was this even possible for a human to do?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who dares to cause trouble at the Pegasus Club?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kyle's furious voice boomed from inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's harsh punishment of Brent and the others had finally alerted Kyle within.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kyle, disheveled and with a flushed face still glowing with excitement, had been in the throes of passion with two women, only to be rudely interrupted, his anger flaring instantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's eyes sharply scanned Kyle&mdash;the high-ranking member of the Vanderbilt family, Felix's uncle, and a metahuman with fire power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's All-seeing Eyes could see a surge of red energy within Kyle, harboring immense power. This was clearly his fire power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No wonder he had inflicted such severe injuries on Charlize!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kyle looked at Bradley, whose face was swollen on one side, bloodied and bruised.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though it looked terrifying, there was no danger to his life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unconscious Brent wasn't so fortunate. He lay there motionless, his breathing growing weaker by the moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Vanderbilt, you have to avenge me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bradley lay on the ground, trembling, the searing pain on his cheek nearly driving him mad.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kyle glared menacingly at Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you know that the Pegasus Club is a property of the Red Umbrella Group? Do you know who I am? You dare to injure my guests. Are you looking for death?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had only seen Alexander's photo and, in his rage, didn't recognize him on the spot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander ignored Kyle completely. Instead, he looked at the others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What... what do you want to do?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The rest were petrified with fear, all hoping Alexander wouldn't turn on them, scrambling to hide.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander pointed at the women and said calmly, "You all leave. This doesn't concern you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The women who had been coerced shuddered, tears streaming down their faces as they ran outside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anyone who tried to stop them was slapped away by Alexander, falling to the ground and spitting out blood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Whoever dares to block will be shown no mercy!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's domineering aura silenced everyone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All the women left without any objections or interventions, not even from Kyle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kyle gnashed his teeth, staring at Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I know who you are now. You're Alexander!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Finally, you recognize me? Your eyesight seems poor. Tell me. Where have you hidden my daughter?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's deep eyes were filled with ruthlessness and murderous intent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, the temperature in the room plummeted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Walls, sofas, tables, chandeliers, floors... A layer of icy frost covered everything in the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kyle and his friends shivered, their hair standing on end.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, so you're a metahuman with freezing power? You think that can suppress my fire power? Dream on!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kyle suddenly waved his hand, and a torrent of scorching flame erupted, ravaging the room and instantly melting all the frost.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I thought you were more formidable. Die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kyle laughed triumphantly and stomped his foot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The solid marble floor shattered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The powerful recoil propelled Kyle like a launched arrow, charging fiercely at Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kyle roared and punched Alexander's head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His </span><span>fist</span><span> was engulfed in flames, terrifying to behold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In fact, this punch had concentrated all of Kyle's fire power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Faced with a formidable enemy like Alexander, he had even exceeded his limits, his strength approaching that of a level-two metahuman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander had used the Force to simulate freezing, leading Kyle to believe he was a level-one metahuman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kyle thought this punch, if not able to shatter Alexander's skull, would at least force him into a desperate dodge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The flames howled!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His </span><span>fist</span><span> pierced through Alexander's head, but there was no expected splatter of blood and flesh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kyle's smile froze, replaced by horror.</span></p><div class="pagination">
