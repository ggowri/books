  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava smiled and said, "I'll choose Alexander!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Ms. Blackburn, I advise you to reconsider. After all, the new chairman..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Emma was interrupted by Ava before she could finish.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Enough, I've made my decision. It's Alexander!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Alexander was chosen by the Godfather to be my fianc&eacute;, so he should naturally be my dance partner. Even if the new chairman wants to support Ryan, would he dare go against the Godfather's orders?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Emma was left speechless by Ava's confidence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava continued with certainty.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"The chairman can support Ryan, but I can support Alexander.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Not only will I make Alexander my dance partner, but I'll also make sure everyone in Loscity knows that Alexander belongs to me!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Emma was stunned. She thought Ava had lost her mind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava waved her hand dismissively. "Get the car ready. I want to see Alexander."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Reluctantly, Emma had no choice but to comply.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At that moment, Alexander was meditating in the living room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Hearing the doorbell ring, he checked the security screen and saw that Ava was at the door, with Emma holding several large bags.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander quickly opened the door.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Ms. Blackburn, what brings you here?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He happily looked at Ava, who was dressed in a light purple gown, her skin smooth, and her smile radiant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava smiled back. "Why can't I be here? I bought you some supplies and food."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander was a little overwhelmed by the gesture and didn't know what to say. He thought, "Could Ava really have feelings for me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Seeing Alexander in his workout clothes, Ava asked curiously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What were you doing? Exercising?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I was meditating," Alexander replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava didn't pay much attention to it. Meditation was common among the upper class, along with yoga and other trends.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Emma dropped the numerous bags onto the table, panting with exhaustion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"So heavy. Ms. Blackburn bought all this for you. There's food and drinks, too."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander was deeply touched. "Ms. Blackburn, you're too kind to me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava giggled. "When you make it big, you'd better thank me properly."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander laughed heartily. "What if you made a mistake, and I never get rich, Ms. Blackburn?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I don't believe that!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava was full of confidence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"With your abilities, you'll be successful in no time. How about I introduce you to some important people? They've all got old ailments. If you can cure them, you'll gain a lot of support!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She looked at Alexander with bright, hopeful eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander felt a warmth in his heart, filled with gratitude, unsure of what to say.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Aside from Lily, Ava was the only one who treated him so well.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">During the years he was with Jane, she never cared for him and saw him as useless.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander said gratefully, "Ms. Blackburn, thank you for your trust, but I'm not really in the mood to treat anyone right now."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Emma wasn't happy about that and said with a pout.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Ms. Blackburn is giving you an opportunity, and you're just throwing it away? You're hopeless..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Shut up! Wait in the car."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava ruthlessly sent Emma away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Alexander, I'd like to invite you to be my dance partner at the Saint Group's ball. Will you join me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Without hesitation, Alexander nodded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Sure, I'll be there!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava suddenly grabbed his hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Come on. Let's go buy you some nice clothes for the ball. We need to impress at the ball."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Alright!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander held her hand tightly, his heart suddenly racing, feeling like it was his first love.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Hand in hand, they walked toward the shopping district, chatting and laughing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Emma followed at a distance in the car, watching the two of them so close together, completely at a loss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Ms. Blackburn is done for, duped by this scoundrel!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just then, two black business cars sped toward them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What's that guy doing in Bevery Hills?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Billy couldn't help but frown.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The bald man beside him said confidently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Boss, I've already looked into it. That guy is just a penniless nobody. He's probably working as a security guard or janitor here. There's no way he lives in Bevery Hills."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Billy let out a long sigh of relief. He couldn't afford to offend the people who lived here.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The bald man, excited, pointed at Alexander.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"That's him! Jane said if we bring him back, she'll give us fifty grand right away."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With that, Billy waved his hand, and the two cars blocked Alexander's path.</p><div class="pagination">
