  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Andrew gritted his teeth, finally conceding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fine! But I can't pull together that much cash right now. Mr. Gellar, could you cut us a break and accept a little less?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A satisfied smile spread across Jackson's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's all about your attitude. If you can scrape together a bit less, I might be willing to work with you. How much can you manage?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Andrew quickly dialed the bank manager, using the Fairfax family's fixed assets as collateral, along with a few million in their account. After a tense moment, he managed to cobble together 40 million.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Gellar, it's a bit rushed, but we can only manage 40 million at most. How does that sound?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jackson waved his hand dismissively.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Forty million it is! No more chit-chat&mdash;let's get that transfer done."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane, ever the quick thinker, pulled out a contract.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Gellar, since we've reached an agreement, let's make it official. You'll grant the Brilliant Group the exclusive rights to the magic powder, and once we sign, we'll transfer the funds immediately."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without a moment's hesitation, Jackson signed the document, barely glancing at the terms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Andrew felt a pang of reluctance as he finally transferred the money to Jackson's account.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He leaned closer to Jane, his voice low with concern. "Jane, are you sure there won't be any issues?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane rolled her eyes, excitement bubbling over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dad, what are you worried about? The contract is signed, so what could possibly go wrong? Big deals require big risks, and this amount is nothing to Mr. Gellar. He won't cheat us."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Right, right, you're right." Andrew finally relaxed a bit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jackson's eyes lit up as he received the 40 million.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There's just one more condition. Felicity must spend the night with me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She'll be my woman, and after tomorrow's conference, we'll have an engagement party. I'll gift Felicity 500 million dollars&mdash;she can buy whatever she wants. How does that sound?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Andrew gasped, saying, "Five hundred million? That's more than ten times what we just agreed to!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane, filled with jealousy, chimed in, "Felicity, look how much Mr. Gellar likes you! Five hundred million dollars just like that! Can you find another guy who's so generous?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felicity's face hardened, devoid of any smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't like him. Someone will come to rescue me soon, and you won't be able to stop him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jackson slammed his hand on the table, irritated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is it your boyfriend? I'd like to see who has the guts to compete with me. One phone call, and I could have him taken care of."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felicity felt a chill run down her spine. She was genuinely scared that Jackson might try to retaliate against Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She quickly got up, attempting to dash for the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hold it! Where do you think you're going? Do you even consider us your elders?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Andrew grabbed her arm firmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Belinda chimed in sarcastically, "Felicity, are you hiding a boyfriend from us?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Those guys are all broke and have no family background. We won't support you; we'll fight you on this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Only Mr. Gellar is acceptable. You must marry him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jackson smirked, reveling in the moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just a freshly graduated college kid, huh? I'll show him what real status looks like and make him feel small enough to back off..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, the door swung open, and Alexander walked in with an air of calm confidence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, save me!" Felicity exclaimed, rushing toward him and hiding behind his back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought, "I can't believe Alexander got here so quickly! Was that really him I saw earlier in the VIP corridor?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The expressions on Andrew and the others turned to shock, quickly morphing into rage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What the hell are you doing here? You scoundrel! How dare you try to seduce Felicity?" Andrew </span><span>shouted,</span><span> his face flushed with anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane shot daggers at </span><span>Alexander,</span><span> her glare fierce enough to feel like it could cut him in half.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jackson stood up, his demeanor shifting to one of hostility as he approached Alexander, sizing Alexander up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Felicity is my fianc&eacute;e. What do you want with her?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm not! I never agreed to that!" Felicity quickly shook her head, her eyes pleading as she looked at Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander returned Jackson's gaze, not impressed by the wiry man in front of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said, "So, you're the self-proclaimed magic powder developer?"</span></p><div class="pagination">
