  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Lynn felt a wave of guilt wash over her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What kind of mother was she, cozying up with her daughter's boyfriend?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She couldn't bear to think of where this might lead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, she felt Alexander's hand move lower, teasingly edging toward her skirt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, I must stop this! If Ava finds out, what will she think? Can I really face her?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Don't be so uptight! You know you enjoy being held. Isn't it thrilling?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This is wrong! You're a slutty woman!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shut up!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stop it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lynn felt as if two voices were arguing in her head, and she became flustered, a wave of dizziness hitting her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander quickly wrapped his arms around her waist and helped her to the couch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you okay? Do you feel unwell?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, I can't keep moving. I feel a bit lightheaded."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her cheeks flushed as she realized she was indeed tipsy, but she couldn't help herself and drained the rest of her drink.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander could clearly sense Lynn's agitation as he held her hand, gently caressing it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ava is the woman I cherish. It's my responsibility to take care of you both. You don't need to feel so guilty... I suddenly feel like I might be in the wrong!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lynn was taken aback by Alexander's unexpected admission.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What do you mean? What did you do wrong?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He brushed his fingers against her cheek softly. "It's all my fault. I've started to like you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop! Don't say silly things. You like my daughter."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lynn's face turned crimson as she held his face in her hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Remember, you're engaged to my daughter. I only have one daughter, and I don't want to hurt her. Besides, I'm not as young as I used to be; how could you possibly like someone my age?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander shook his head firmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're not old at all. Tonight, your appearance proves my point."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lynn said nothing, her eyes wide as she gazed at him. The warmth of their breaths mingled in the air, creating an electrifying atmosphere.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The desire arose again, this time with a giddy feeling of happiness, which made it difficult for her to breathe and kept burning in her chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What a wonderful man. Why can't I be as lucky as my daughter?" she thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they leaned closer, their noses almost touching, their lips brushed together, sharing soft breaths.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The fire in their eyes reflected a deep connection, and at that moment, they felt like just two ordinary people.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caught in the romantic atmosphere, Lynn closed her eyes, her long lashes fluttering slightly. She decided to let things flow naturally; whatever was meant to happen would happen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that thought, she leaned in to kiss Alexander, who responded with a soft kiss of his own, wrapping his left arm around her shoulder and another hand touched her breast.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmm..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lynn embraced him tightly, her right hand gripping his hair as she eagerly kissed him back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander found himself lost in the moment, impressed by her passionate kiss.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His right hand had already reached under the skirt, feeling a warm, wet, and charmingly smooth feeling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a while, Lynn leaned back, her breathing heavy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can't believe how good that felt...Alexander and I.</span><span>..what</span><span> am I doing?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a fleeting moment of clarity, she thought, "What am I doing? He's my daughter's man!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She couldn't believe what she was doing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately, her clarity only lasted for a moment, and her body was like a volcano before an eruption, unable to be contained even if she wanted to.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wanted to push Alexander away but ended up holding him tightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wanted to resist loudly, but when she opened her mouth, apart from lewd moans, all she could say were incoherent and unclear words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't! Stop..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Alexander misinterpreted her hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry. I won't stop!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The villa echoed with soft sounds of their connection, and after what felt like an eternity, everything finally settled into a calm silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lynn collapsed onto the couch, her body slick with sweat, her butt trembling slightly as she savored the lingering sensations of the orgasm.</span></p><div class="pagination">
