  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nicholas and his companion were entangled in a heated embrace. He gasped for breath as they made love.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She straddled his legs, swaying wildly under the influence of the drug. Her hair whipped through the air with each passionate motion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Both were lost in the throes of ecstasy, breathing heavily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She clung tightly to Nicholas, pressing his face against her boobs.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just as Nicholas was nearly suffocating in her plush boobs, a cold voice sounded behind him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Are you Nicholas Prescott?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nicholas was right at the critical moment, on the verge of climax.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He snarled viciously, "Who the hell are you? How'd you get in here? Get the fuck out!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander's eyes were cold as ice behind his silver mask.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You can wait for me in hell. Guzman will be joining you soon."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Before Nicholas could react, Alexander gripped his head and twisted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A sharp crack echoed through the room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nicholas's head rotated a full 180 degrees, his eyes wide with shock and disbelief.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the moment of death, the body tenses and contracts from the intense stimulus.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The young woman, oblivious to what had transpired, continued her movements.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Excited by Nicholas's sudden hardness and swelling, she straddled his lap and wildly moved as if possessed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander looked at the young girl with a complex gaze, pitying her deep addiction.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nicholas's body thudded to the ground, and the girl fainted at the peak of ecstasy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander took Nicholas's ID badge and then placed his palm on the corpse.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The powerful Force instantly consumed the body, igniting it in searing flames that engulfed the entire room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander vanished into the night like a phantom...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The Brilliant Group's Loscity branch...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Daniel frowned as he left the company, his hand pausing on the car door handle. He eyed a shadowy spot warily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He could barely make out a man standing there, wearing a silver mask that glinted eerily in the dim streetlight.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You're Daniel, the number three at the Brilliant Group's Loscity division?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander asked coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Who are you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Daniel clenched his fists as he sized up Alexander.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Either become my subordinate, or join Nicholas in hell."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander's tone was frighteningly detached.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Daniel was shocked to his core.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You dare touch Nicholas? Do you know we're with the Brilliant Group?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander sneered, "If you're so eager to die for Guzman, I'll grant your wish."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As soon as the words left his mouth, Alexander sprang into action.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His Force exploded with power as he launched himself like a cannonball straight at Daniel.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Daniel's eyes widened in disbelief. Though skilled himself, he felt like a fully loaded semi-truck was barreling towards him, the rush of air sharp as knives against his face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Daniel gritted his teeth and threw a desperate punch at Alexander with all his might.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander sneered, "An ant should know its place. You, however, seem to have forgotten yours."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Daniel's agonized scream pierced the air as he was sent flying, crashing hard onto the ground.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He lay motionless, his body a broken mess of shattered bones. His eyes were wide with disbelief and terror.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Crimson blood trickled from Daniel's mouth, pooling beneath him like a dreadful flower of death.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even in his final moments, Daniel couldn't fathom who his attacker was or why he'd been targeted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"So this is the best a head of security can do? He doesn't even measure up to Joseph."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander shrugged dismissively.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As before, he left only Nicholas's ID badge behind, then used The Force to incinerate the corpse.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Just one left. Betty!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander stared into the depths of the night, his eyes gleaming with icy determination.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Betty lived in an upscale neighborhood near Bevery Hills.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Two security guards were patrolling, chuckling about their plans to vacation in Soutaxia, where the women were "spicy".</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just then, a sleek black Mercedes came speeding down the street, pulling up in front of a villa with a pool.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A stunning woman stepped out, wearing a white off-the-shoulder gown that showcased her swan-like neck and alluring collarbones.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her ample boobs were particularly eye-catching, pushed up by her bra to create a mesmerizing cleavage that could make any man weak in the knees.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She carried a designer handbag and teetering on blinged-out stilettos, sashayed towards the villa's entrance, her curves swaying with each step.</p><div class="pagination">
