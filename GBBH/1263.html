  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ashley noticed Alexander staring at her. She reached up to touch his forehead and asked in her sweet, childish voice, "Daddy, why do you look so spaced out? Are you getting sick?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander couldn't help but burst out laughing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, he spotted Charlize at the end of the hallway. She was keeping watch while throwing intense glances in their direction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After telling Ashley to keep watching her cartoons, Alexander walked over to where Charlize stood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had to admit, he'd been neglecting her lately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment Alexander led Charlize into his study and closed the door, she threw herself into his arms. She wrapped her hands around his neck and pressed her lips against his.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander never lacked female attention, but Charlize had eyes only for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The chemistry between them was instant and explosive. Charlize could barely contain herself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander... what if Ms. Blackburn..." Charlize asked, her face flushed with embarrassment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Being more modest than Alexander, she felt self-conscious. Ava was busy in the kitchen, and Charlize couldn't bear the thought of being caught.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Alexander was already burning with desire, his body responding naturally to her presence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry, they just started cooking. It'll take them at least an hour, we've got plenty of time," Alexander reassured her, pushing Charlize down onto the desk so she was lying on her stomach. He quickly pulled her clothes off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inside was a strapless bra. Alexander ripped it off without a second thought. Charlize's plump breasts jumped out, bouncing and trembling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander immediately grabbed them and squeezed them hard, making Charlize moan and tingle, her body slumping on the table.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This wasn't their first time. Alexander thrust his cock into Charlize's pussy without hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They came out from the study half an hour later. Alexander had kept things brief, but Charlize was still reaching orgasm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After that, Alexander spent some time playing with </span><span>Ashley</span><span> before dinner.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At nine o'clock, he retired to his room early. He lay in bed scrolling through his phone while waiting for Ava.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava was in the bathroom showering. Soon, she walked out wearing an alluring nightgown.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's eyes lit up at the sight. She wore a black sheer negligee, the translucent fabric offering teasing glimpses of her fair skin as she moved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The contrast of black against white enhanced Ava's natural beauty, making her even more captivating. She radiated the allure of a confident woman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her delicate skin had a rosy flush from the hot shower, making her more lovely than any flower in bloom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander lay in bed, smiling as Ava came to his embrace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava snuggled into Alexander's arms and asked in a soft voice, "The trip to Louvian Port was dangerous, wasn't it? Here, let me give you a massage to help you relax."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's interest perked up immediately, and he stretched out on the bed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava slipped off her shoes and straddled his thighs, starting to work her hands over his shoulders and neck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was clear she'd had some training. Her delicate hands found just the right pressure as they worked their way across his shoulders, down his back, and to his waist. Alexander felt himself melting into the mattress.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mmm, that feels amazing," he murmured. "I had no idea you were so good at this. You'll have to do this more often."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's face showed pure contentment as he praised her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh yeah? I'm glad you like it," Ava said, beaming at his approval.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, her tone turned playful but with an edge of jealousy. "But hey, with all those women around you, you could probably set up a rotation and have someone different give you a massage every day, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Heh, is someone getting jealous?" Alexander couldn't help but laugh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava gave him a little pinch and rolled away, her face flushed. "As if I'd get jealous over you! Massage time is over!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She flopped down beside him and gave him the silent treatment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander didn't offer any comfort. Instead, he pinned Ava down, making her blush and tremble slightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing her reaction, Alexander chuckled with satisfaction. Their time together had made her more responsive to his presence, which pleased him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you won't give me a massage, I'll give you one instead."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Ava could protest, Alexander's hands were already at work.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava's cheeks turned crimson as she gazed at him with her glistening eyes.</span></p><div class="pagination">
