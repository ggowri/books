  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd exchanged glances, incredulous that anyone would consider a mere rock worth 10 million dollars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even among the wealthy attendees, no one was eager to drop that kind of cash on something they wouldn't use.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You don't have to buy it; I've got it covered..." Alexander began, but Ava interrupted him with a playful smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, if you're so determined to have it, I'll buy it for you as a gift. You can't refuse my generosity; it's the thought that counts!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A warmth spread through Alexander as he felt her kindness wash over him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Guests around them shot him envious glances, whispering about how lucky he was to have a woman willing to spend money on him. After all, ladies like Ava were a rare find.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>David's gaze turned icy as he watched Ava.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The auctioneer, clearly excited, called out, "Ten million!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We have a bid of ten million from this lovely lady. Is there anyone willing to raise the stakes?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>David hesitated, weighing his options.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Houtte</span><span>, seated beside him, leaned in and whispered, "Mr. Federer, if you drop ten million on a rock, some folks from the Federer family will definitely question your judgment. Don't worry; once the auction wraps up, I'll make sure Alexander knows who's boss."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, David took a deep breath, suppressing his frustration, and nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ten million, first call, second call, third call... sold! Congratulations to this lady for securing the meteorite at 10 million dollars!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The auctioneer's voice rang out with enthusiasm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Originally estimated to sell for six or seven million, the meteorite had fetched a staggering price. The auctioneer's commission would be quite the bonus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander glanced at </span><span>Houtte</span><span>, thinking, "This guy's been cozying up to Orion, and now he's whispering to David. He's definitely up to no good."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the auction continued, Alexander found little interest in the subsequent items and refrained from bidding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just when impatience began to creep in, the auctioneer presented a red tray.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the center of the tray lay a yellowish gemstone, roughly the size of a ping-pong ball.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Its rich, pure luster was interwoven with shimmering golden threads, a true masterpiece.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander felt a surge of excitement, sensing the earth's energy radiating from the gem.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was the kind of stone worthy of crafting a Lightsaber.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Next up, we have our most important item: a natural, top-quality yellow gemstone. The starting bid is set at 30 million dollars, with a minimum increment of 500 thousand!" the auctioneer announced, his enthusiasm infectious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The atmosphere in the room shifted, excitement palpable as the gemstone made its appearance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Such rare treasures were seldom seen and were often regarded as family heirlooms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The wealthy attendees were eager to bid, driven by both pride and desire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thirty-one million!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thirty-two million!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Forty million!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the blink of an eye, the price had skyrocketed by 10 million.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, Alexander remained calm, watching the proceedings without raising his paddle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava leaned in, puzzled. "Aren't you going to bid? You've been eyeing this for a while."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smiled serenely, glancing over at David's side of the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"David and </span><span>Houtte</span><span> are in the mix. If I jump in now, it'll only fuel their fire. No need to rush; let's see how this plays out."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, the price climbed to 60 million.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Many bidders began to drop out; even for the wealthy, 60 million was a hefty sum.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>David turned to Alexander with a mocking tone. "I heard you've had your eye on this gem for ages.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, I'm not letting you have it. Sure, you've got that magic powder, but with such a short sales history, you're probably looking at a profit of just over 100 million. You can't outbid me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In David's eyes, if the price got too steep, even Ava wouldn't back Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander watched him with a cold, detached gaze, a sneer of contempt appearing on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He finally raised his paddle, his voice calm but carrying an unmistakable weight. "One hundred million."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The jump of 40 million in one go left the room gasping&mdash;everyone sucked in a sharp breath. A collective murmur rippled through the crowd. They thought, "Is this some kind of joke? Who would casually throw around that kind of money like it is nothing?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But what they didn't understand was that this gem wasn't just another shiny rock. To Alexander, it was the key to unlocking a massive power boost. Once he had enough to forge the Lightsaber, his strength would soar to unimaginable heights.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This gem was priceless in Alexander's eyes, a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. If he missed out on it, who knew how long he'd have to wait?</span></p><div class="pagination">
