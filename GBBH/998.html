  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gavin stood </span><span>silently,</span><span> disbelief etched across his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, </span><span>Why</span><span> would Alexander, a man who clearly fears nothing&mdash;not even the Vance family&mdash;give up such a massive profit? Trading half the earnings from the magic powder for weapons, ammunition, supplies, medicines, and production lines? It doesn't make sense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Puzzled, he shook his head, deciding not to dwell on it. After all, he hadn't lost anything. If anything, he had gained immensely from this arrangement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, the cemetery exuded a solemn grandeur. Countless flowers surrounded Alexander's mother's grave, their sweet and heavy fragrance lingering in the crisp air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Axel and Asher knelt before the tombstone, their faces blank and devoid of any emotion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elite warriors stood in disciplined formation, their sharp presence complementing the black-suited members of the Ultimate Alliance. The synchronized sound of three salutes shattered the quiet as gunshots echoed in succession, heightening the gravity of the moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sheer scale of the memorial service moved many of Alexander's relatives to tears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily clutched Alexander's hand tightly, her voice trembling with emotion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is incredible, Alexander. You've really made it. I'm so proud of you..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander scanned the faces before him. His relatives displayed a spectrum of emotions: shock, awe, fear, joy, and admiration. The scene filled him with an intoxicating sense of power, knowing that he was now the focal point of this complex family dynamic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He smirked inwardly, certain that Elliot and Cameron would hear of this soon enough. When they do, they'll regret looking down on me. They might even crawl back, begging for favor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's thoughts turned cold. And when they do, I'll be ready to teach them a lesson they won't forget. I've endured their disdain for years, swallowing my anger and resentment. But now? Now, I can finally release it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"God </span><span>bless</span><span>!" Lily exclaimed, her excitement bubbling over as she began to pray. "Alexander, you've truly made it big..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava, standing nearby, watched Alexander with a mixture of admiration and unease. This man never ceased to surprise her, and his meteoric rise made her wonder about her place alongside him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One relative stepped forward, unable to hide their excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, I never imagined someone could take down the Vance family in </span><span>Kingsdon</span><span>. You're amazing!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Another chimed in, "We're so proud of you. Just don't forget about us when you're </span><span>sitting at the top!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As his relatives surrounded him, their words of admiration and excitement flowed freely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smiled graciously, nodding. "Thank you for your support. If any of you ever need help, don't hesitate to reach out."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The buzz of his relatives' chatter grew louder, but Ava's heart grew heavier. She thought, As Alexander climbs higher, will I be able to keep up? Or will we eventually drift apart?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander turned to Lennox, the cemetery director.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're an upright man," Alexander said. "From now on, this cemetery is under your care. Don't worry, your salary will be doubled."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Extending his hand, Alexander met Lennox's gaze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lennox grasped Alexander's hand tightly, gratitude shining in his eyes. "Thank you, Mr. Hawthorne. Thank you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Having worked at the cemetery for three decades, Lennox had seen countless memorials for the wealthy and powerful. But none had matched the scale or gravity of this event. Witnessing the Vance family humbled only solidified his respect for Alexander's unparalleled strength and ambition.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dad, hug me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ashley wriggled out of Ava's arms and ran toward Alexander, wrapping her tiny arms around his legs and pouting adorably.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander scooped her up effortlessly, planting a kiss on her cheek.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My dear, are you ready to go home?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Eww, stinky Dad! Your saliva is gross!" Ashley protested, scrubbing her cheek dramatically before wrapping her little arms around his face and licking him twice with playful defiance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander burst into laughter, and the surrounding relatives joined in, their laughter easing the solemn atmosphere.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Axel and Asher remained silent, their faces grim and tight with humiliation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Augusta," Alexander said, his tone sharp, "have Sir Vance sign the cemetery transfer agreement for free and collect the 100-million-dollar compensation."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carrying his daughter in one arm, Alexander joined Gavin in conversation as the group began to leave the cemetery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Augusta lingered, his sneer deepening as he stared down at Axel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Axel clenched his teeth, knowing he was in no position to argue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beside him, Asher's eyes burned with hatred, his thoughts dark with revenge. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll kill Alexander. He'll pay for this humiliation."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the dignitaries boarded their luxurious buses, a white-haired elder leaned toward Gavin and asked, "Gavin, are you really so optimistic about Alexander? Sure, he's got power and influence now, but he's got women around him, and he even has a daughter. Do you really think Grace should be involved with someone like him?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gavin let out a bitter sigh, his expression complicated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How could he intervene?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grace had told him everything. Last night, she had already been with Alexander and made it clear she would marry no one else.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gavin thought, Otherwise, I wouldn't have gone to such lengths to support Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, the elders&mdash;some of the highest-ranking figures in the Eagle Empire&mdash;remained reflective. For them, wealth was merely a number. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's willingness to surrender half his profits from the magic powder had caught their attention, but Gavin's personal endorsement of the young man carried even more weight.</span></p><div class="pagination">
