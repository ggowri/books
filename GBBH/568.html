  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, Barry was still worrying about how to get enough money for a comeback.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jaylon smirked and said, "How about this? You scrape together some cash, throw in that woman, and we settle this with a single hand. What do you think?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He pointed at Joyce.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What? A single hand to decide it all?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barry was stunned for a moment, then grew excited.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just a little cash and Joyce as a wager, and he could settle it all with one hand?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Right now, Barry definitely couldn't come up with five hundred million dollars!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jaylon eyed Joyce's slender, attractive figure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You could use this woman as your comeback bet. I think it's your only chance to win, so don't miss it," Jaylon said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jaylon and Finley exchanged a look, both grinning slyly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barry's group, including Felix, all had a change of expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Diego, who had always had a tense relationship with Joyce, looked furious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix, however, looked smug, never expecting that they'd be bold enough to go this far. He thought they'd be satisfied with draining Barry's money, but here they were, eyeing Joyce as well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was nothing more humiliating for a man than having his woman taken, and now Jaylon and Finley were openly trying to claim Barry's woman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joyce's face was pale, her body trembling with rage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wasn't a member of the Morris family, but as Barry's secretary, she held a high-ranking servant's position within the family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Given the Morris family's influence, nobody dared mess with her, even though she was technically a servant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even wealthy and powerful people outside the family would respectfully call her name, and no one would dare lust after her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Joyce knew Barry all too well. He was a reckless gambler down to his last. When Finley and Jaylon made their proposal, her heart sank completely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Barry agreed to their demand, there was a high chance he'd lose. Joyce would have no way to resist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The casino was ruthless; you play, you pay!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And with The Kaylon backing this casino, even the Morris family wouldn't go against such a powerful force for the sake of a mere servant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, it was just a matter of whether Barry would agree.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You bastards are crossing the line. Do you think I won't kill you?" Barry spat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barry stood, slamming his hands on the table, his eyes brimming with murderous intent as he glared at Finley and Jaylon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His powerful killing aura seemed to lower the temperature in the VIP room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finley and Jaylon shivered uncontrollably, their faces turning pale.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But they were seasoned enough to handle it, and they had powerful backing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finley fought the urge to run, gritting his teeth as he said, "This is The Kaylon entertainment center. You can't just do as you please here! If you keep threatening us, we'll have The Kaylon handle it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sir, please control yourself!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The beautiful dealer had already placed her hand on the alarm, ready to summon security if Barry made a move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barry sat back down, his face dark with anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clearly, he had no desire to offend The Kaylon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Barry back down and suppress his anger, Finley and Jaylon grew bold again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jaylon gave him a sideways glance, sneering, "Barry, are you still in or out? This single hand could be your last shot at a comeback!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you're too scared to play, then today's game ends here. You'll just be the unlucky fool who lost over half a billion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hahaha, no wait! I got it wrong. You're just a broke, spineless coward afraid of losing."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Enough!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barry's anger showed in the veins bulging on his forehead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He clenched his fists and finally gritted his teeth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fine, I'll take your bet!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diego grew anxious before Barry even finished speaking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Morris, isn't this a bad idea?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joyce fell to her knees in front of Barry, pleading.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Morris, have you given up on me? Don't use me as a wager. You'll lose..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joyce's eyes filled with tears, her lashes damp as her delicate frame trembled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Barry had absolute control over her, and she couldn't resist, even if she wanted to.</span></p><div class="pagination">
