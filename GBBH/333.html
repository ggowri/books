  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander saw Scott, whose whole body was dark, and he was immediately furious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I told you not to take off the necklace! What's wrong with you? You broke my necklace."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quentin quickly apologized, "I'm sorry. It was Madison who broke it, and I've asked them to get out. Mr. Hawthorne, please help me and save Scott. Whatever you want me to do, I'll do it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, he kept begging and didn't look like a four-star general at all. Quentin just looked like a pitiful old man who was worried about his juniors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's expression softened, and he waved his hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Forget it. Fortunately, I came back in time. If I had been a little later, he wouldn't have been saved."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you, Mr. Hawthorne. Thank you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quentin kept expressing gratitude.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brittany's eyes were red from crying, and she looked at Alexander with gratitude.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, in her mind, he was so tall and trustworthy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander quickly took the purchases out of the shopping bag.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It turned out to be a large piece of honeycomb, and there was still some honey on the honeycomb that had not been removed. It was sticky and no wonder he took so long. This thing was not easy to deal with.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone was confused and wondered why Alexander bought this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Later, he placed his hand on Scott's forehead, activated the Force, and then placed the honeycomb in front of Scott.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the Force continued to be input into Scott's body, the dark air on his face gradually faded away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, thin, dark lines emerged from Scott's nostrils, ear holes, and corners of his eyes and gathered toward the honeycomb.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The originally brown and yellow honeycomb was stained with dark spots, which became more and more dense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quentin curiously took a few steps closer and carefully observed the changes in the honeycomb.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although he was a four-star general, he was so scared that he screamed, "Ah! They are all little bugs!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone could see clearly that these dark lines were made up of countless dark insects.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was hard to imagine that there were so many terrible bugs in Scott's body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The room was silent and suffocating with terror.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone's face turned pale, and they were trembling with fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the Force continued to be input, beads of sweat appeared on Alexander's forehead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The honeycomb had turned dark, and finally, no more dark lines came out of Scott's body. All the witchcraft insects were firmly stuck to the sticky honeycomb.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay, there's no danger anymore," Alexander smiled with satisfaction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this time, Scott's skin color had completely returned to normal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quentin suppressed the fear in his heart and asked carefully, "Mr. Hawthorne, is Scott </span><span>really</span><span> okay?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander nodded and said, "It's okay. I've already driven out all the witchcraft insects in his body. These witchcraft insects not only parasitize the human body but also like to eat honey.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tell someone to burn this honeycomb immediately. Don't let it touch people's skin directly, or people will get infected."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, Quentin quickly asked someone to do it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Walter and a few of his companions used shovels to pack the honeycomb into the box and seal it. They put on thick gloves before they dared to lift the box out and burn it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"After the witchcraft insects parasitizes the human body, it will hollow out and eat the whole person from head to toe, leaving only an empty human skin."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Alexander's tone was calm, everyone was so frightened that their faces turned pale, and they couldn't recover for a while.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this time, Scott woke up again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Scott!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brittany rushed over in surprise and joy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quentin burst into tears and was full of gratitude to Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone looked at Alexander in awe and never dared to look down on him again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander asked Scott, "Mr. Scott Thompson, think back, have you ever come into contact with any bad people or things?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quentin said quickly, "Scott, Mr. Hawthorne is your savior. If you have anything to say, just speak honestly."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Scott was lost in memories and stood there for a moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, right! I remember..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He suddenly slapped his head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I met a mysterious man in a dark cloak at the bar. He said he wanted to discuss a business deal with my grandpa and asked me to help him contact you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course, I refused this kind of inexplicable thing!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then, the guy tapped me on the shoulder, and I felt something was wrong. It is a spooky feeling..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone listened to Scott's narration in silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quentin's expression was very gloomy. This mysterious man must be a dark wizard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What did he want to talk to him about? He was afraid it was not a good thing!</span></p><div class="pagination">
