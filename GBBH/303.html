  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Whether gentle or forceful, the Force flowed into Ava's body, bringing undeniable sensations of excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That feels so good..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava clenched her fists, unable to contain her admiration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Alexander's massage, and under the effect of Force, she felt as if she was </span><span>floating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, her mind went blank, and she found herself breathless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She gritted her teeth, desperately trying not to make any sounds of embarrassment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smiled smugly. The treatment was already complete, but he didn't stop.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead, he encouraged Ava to lie on the bed, her curves accentuated as she did, the design of her outfit enhancing her figure...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander greedily licked his lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wondered who had invented such an outfit. It was truly a distraction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You said you were just helping me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava turned her head back, her cheeks flushed with annoyance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, it was as if a switch had been flipped. Alexander could no longer contain himself and moved closer...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a sleep that felt like an eternity, Alexander suddenly felt a tickle in his nose.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With his eyes still closed, he rolled to the side, landing right on top of Ava.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Startled, Ava laughed and shouted, "No, please... let me go..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Alexander opened his eyes, he found Ava playfully brushing her hair against his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing him awaken, Ava pouted. "Charlize is waiting for us. Now I feel embarrassed."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then you should rest well. I'll arrange her work."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander patted her before getting dressed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he headed downstairs, he found Charlize sitting on the couch, her face flushed, her legs tightly crossed, lost in thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's on your mind?" he asked, gently touching her cheek.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Charlize jolted back to reality and turned away, ignoring him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander chuckled. "Are you jealous?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmph! I'm not jealous. What's there to be jealous of? You're not my man," Charlize replied with a hint of acidity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Today, she wore a cropped top that revealed a generous view of her collarbone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander couldn't help but become erect. Ever since he had harnessed more Force, he felt his desires intensifying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No wonder some warriors fall to the dark side and become Corrupted Warriors due to their desires.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Didn't you just finish? Why are you... uh!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before she could finish, he silenced her with a kiss.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They entwined in a deep kiss, parting only after a long moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Charlize nestled against him, captivated by the rhythm of his heartbeat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's heartbeat slowly, unusually so, leaving her puzzled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not only was it unusually slow, but it was also wea. Charlize estimated his heart rate was barely twenty, which was simply unbelievable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's strange. I never noticed how bold you are," she remarked, playfully pinching him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, his phone buzzed, interrupting their moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing it was Augusta, he quickly answered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Augusta excitedly reported, "Boss, I've found Schroder's base in </span><span>Loscity</span><span>. Jane and the </span><span>others are likely being held there..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander asked, "How many members have completed the training?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thirty have passed and are ready for special operations."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Good. Have them prepared; we leave tomorrow."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After hanging up, Alexander teasingly pinched Charlize again, grinning. "Tomorrow, I'll take you all to the beach."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Charlize asked, puzzled, "The beach? Aren't we going to rescue Jane?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smiled mischievously, leaving her in suspense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, in a seaside villa, Schroder was seething.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Smash!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He threw his cup against the floor, berating his subordinates.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Useless! You all are useless! Over twenty people, and you let the </span><span>Fairfaxes</span><span> disappear? How can you still call yourselves a special force?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You have twenty-four hours to find them, especially that Rosen. I want him alive or dead!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
