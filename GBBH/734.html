I'll take Rosalia to Loscity Hospital to get some of the patients to test it out," Alexander ordered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, Mr. Hawthorne!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosalia agreed excitedly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Charlize curled her lips in displeasure, and she missed another opportunity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Loscity Hospital had become the eye of the storm for this disaster.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Loscity used to be a beautiful and charming place. The streets that used to be clean and tidy were now a mess everywhere, and there were emergency vehicles speeding by every now and then.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>People fell down on the side of the road from time to time and never got up again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as people saw someone collapsing, they immediately fled in panic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone was wearing protective masks, but there were still many people coughing, who were obviously infected.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The piercing sound of sirens echoed through the city, mixing with cries for help, as if they had come to hell.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since Loscity Hospital was the hardest hit area, half of the hospital staff had been infected and were unable to protect themselves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This plague was so horrible that the mortality rate was as high as ninety percent or more, and even those who managed to survive would become vegetative.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was the most horrific nightmare!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melin was still guarding the hospital gate diligently and responsibly to maintain order in the hospital.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Watching the dying patients, each one looking wiped out, coughing terribly, and someone collapsing every now and then, made her very anxious and uneasy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't just because of the terrible plague, but Melin hadn't seen Jeff in hours.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Where did he go? Why can't I get in touch..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melin muttered worriedly, thinking, "Did something happen to Jeff?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking about it, Melin was wary in her mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Ward, we still haven't found Jeff."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Several team members came over to report, and they all looked haggard, obviously all reaching extreme fatigue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melin sighed deeply, revealing an extremely reluctant smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You guys should go get some rest, and Jeff will be fine."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Melin, so there you are!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Blaze walked over quickly, waving and exclaiming excitedly at Melin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melin frowned, and a hint of veiled disgust showed in her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Look, I brought you something delicious."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blaze walked over holding a pizza.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The outside of the pizza box was wrapped in several layers of plastic wrap.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under the effect of this terrible plague, any food was under strict seal to prevent being infected.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Melin, who was pretty and charming, Blaze kept glancing at Melin's plump boobs with greedy eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melin got even more skinny from exhaustion, looking incredibly sexy with her unusually plump boobs and slim waist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hurry up and eat it. I got this with great difficulty, and I couldn't bear to enjoy it all </span><span>by myself, so I brought it over to eat with you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blaze handed the pizza over flatteringly, wanting to take the opportunity to touch Melin's hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melin retracted her hand quickly and smiled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dr. Bates, thanks. I'm not hungry at all right now, and I can't eat anything. You can stay and eat yourself."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melin rejected it coldly and bluntly, and Blaze was instantly so embarrassed that he turned pale.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He suppressed his anger and forced a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I know that you're upset about Jeff's disappearance, but have you ever thought that maybe Jeff isn't missing?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melin asked suspiciously, "What do you mean?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blaze rolled his eyes, came over to her, and said with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Maybe Jeff was too scared to stay in a high-risk place like a hospital, so he snuck away..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shut up!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melin chortled angrily, interrupting Blaze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Blaze, look, don't slander Jeff. If he wanted to run, he would have absolutely done it a long time ago, and he didn't have to wait until now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She glared at Blaze angrily, her tone quite harsh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blaze hadn't seen Melin get angry yet, and he subconsciously took a step back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't be angry. I was wrong. I was just saying, but why are you so upset?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blaze smiled helplessly and gave himself an out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Good news! Good news! The expert group and the rescue team are here, and there are so many renowned experts coming. We're saved."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A doctor in a protective suit came flying in, shouting excitedly as he ran.</span></p><div class="pagination">
