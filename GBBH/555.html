  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smiled, "Do you still want to see Nancy again?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"N-No, I don't."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clay trembled with a ferocious expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He bit his tongue hard and spat a mouthful of black blood onto Alexander's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The blood actually whistled through the air like a black, sharp arrow.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander dodged at lightning speed, and Clay took the opportunity to break free and rushed away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a bang, the black blood arrow missed its target and hit the wall hard, quickly corroding a large hole in the hard concrete wall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Obviously, this was also a kind of weird witchcraft.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone was shocked. Clay was really powerful, but Alexander was even more terrifying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was too late for Alexander to catch up with him because Clay was indeed fast.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, you are lucky today. Just wait and see. I will definitely kill you one day!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clay's cursing voice came from afar, betraying his intense hatred of Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Orlando didn't come to his senses. Clay, the pupil of the great elder of the City of Sorcery and the future star, just fled away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Orlando hadn't seen it with his own eyes, he wouldn't have believed it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He quickly reminded Alexander, "Mr. Hawthorne, you must be careful in the future! Clay will definitely take revenge, and the City of Sorcery is not easy to mess with..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He frowned deeply and said no more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander waved his hand nonchalantly. "I offended them a long time ago. It's no big deal."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Orlando hesitated for a long time before sighing, "Mr. Hawthorne, Elaina would be in danger without you. Thank you, Mr. Hawthorne."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smiled, "Mr. Gomez, we have agreed that you must give me the dragon bone fragment."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He gazed at Orlando with deep eyes to see if he would go back on his word.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes. Well, I'm forgetful. I'll get it right away!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Orlando nodded repeatedly and rushed out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The bodyguards all returned to guard the door, and the doctors glanced at each other in shame.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elaina was already well. Feeling redundant and embarrassed, the doctors all left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the blink of an eye, Alexander and Elaina were the only ones left in the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was quiet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elaina was still thinking of the fight between Alexander and Clay. This fantastic duel was something she had never seen in person except in the movies, and it had a tremendous effect on her.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After coming to her senses, she immediately expressed her gratitude to him again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you for saving me, Mr. Hawthorne!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elaina peeked at the handsome Alexander and felt her plump breasts tingle with an indescribable strange sensation.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She behaved herself, never dating a man or going to a bar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although it was for medical treatment, she couldn't get over the fact that Alexander had touched her breasts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're welcome. It's just a fair deal. I had to touch your breasts during the treatment just now. I hope you don't mind."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander had already figured out what was on Elaina's mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her face blushed even more, and she felt inexplicably lost deep in her heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was silence again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Orlando finally ran in, holding a box.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne, this is the dragon bone fragment!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He handed the box to Alexander respectfully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander opened it, and inside was a palm-sized piece of pale bone, which faintly exuded a sense of oppression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps because of the remoteness of the time, the oppression had become extremely feeble, but he sensed it.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though Alexander was a Warrior, his heart skipped a beat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't imagine how powerful the creature would be when it was alive. Did dragons really exist in ancient times?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you, Mr. Gomez. Goodbye!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander got the dragon bone fragment and was eager to go back to treat Ashley.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elaina stood beside Orlando and watched Alexander leave in a daze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was the only child of the Gomez family, a famous beauty in </span><span>Kingsdon</span><span>, and the heiress to a </span><span>family fortune worth tens of billions of dollars</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The men she had met in the past were enthusiastic about her and pestered her relentlessly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But in the course of her time with Alexander just now, Elaina had clearly sensed his cold attitude.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wondered if she should chase after him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She felt shy and inferior at the same time.</span></p><div class="pagination">
