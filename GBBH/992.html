  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Oliver sneered, unwilling to waste any more words with Asher. With a swift kick, he sent Ryder, still clutching a shovel, sprawling onto the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Get lost!" he barked. Turning to his officers, he commanded, "Protect this grave! No one touches it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Yes, Commissioner!" the officers replied in unison.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dozens of officers surged forward, forming a protective perimeter around the grave, shielding Lily and the others. The tide of the confrontation shifted in an instant. Ryder's group, once so aggressive, seemed to deflate, their morale crumbling. Even Asher's bodyguards exchanged uneasy glances, their loyalty faltering under the weight of the situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Lily and Ann exchanged relieved looks, their despair giving way to cautious hope. What seemed like a dire situation was now leaning in their favor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Hmph!" Axel's cold laugh cut through the air, his expression a storm of anger and defiance. "Very well. A mere police commissioner of Loscity dares to challenge the Vance family? Let me remind you&mdash;West Cemetery belongs to us now. Even if God Himself descends, this grave will be dug up today!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"And you think a handful of officers can stop me?" He swept his arm toward the snipers hidden in the shadows. "And those cowards too scared to fire another shot? You've underestimated the Vance family!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Axel's brazen confidence sent a chill through the air, leaving Ava and Oliver frowning deeply. It was clear the Vance family was prepared to escalate this conflict to any extent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Asher, bring them in!" Axel commanded sharply.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"On it!" Asher barked, pulling a signal gun from his belt. With a loud pop, a red flare shot into the sky, exploding like a fiery beacon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Moments later, the thunderous roar of engines shattered the uneasy silence. Military vehicles and light armored carriers stormed the cemetery, the vibrations shaking the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Swish!" Dozens of soldiers leaped from the vehicles, each armed with fully automatic assault rifles. Some carried advanced tracking equipment capable of pinpointing sniper positions from bullet trajectories. Mounted grenade launchers and heavy machine guns loomed ominously, ready to unleash devastation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A reinforced company of more than a hundred heavily armed soldiers formed up, their precision and power undeniable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Axel's triumphant laugh echoed across the cemetery. "Hahaha! Oliver, did you really think you could stop the Vance family today? This grave will be dug up, and you? You'll be stripped of your title as commissioner! Mark my words&mdash;your career ends here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Asher, emboldened by the show of force, drew his pistol and pointed it at Ava and the others. "What now? Got your precious snipers? Let them fire&mdash;I dare you! If they shoot, every last one of you and your families will be wiped out!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His voice boomed with arrogance as he addressed his men. "Get ready! If those snipers fire, kill them all!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Tension hung thick in the air, a suffocating silence pressing down on everyone present.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Oliver's grip on his weapon tightened, but his hand trembled as he aimed. Sweat dripped from his brow. He was outgunned, outnumbered, and painfully aware of the vast influence the Vance family wielded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Regret gnawed at his resolve. Where are Alexander and Gavin? he thought desperately. If they don't show up soon, this situation is going to spiral out of control.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Suddenly, a thunderous roar pierced the air, faint at first but quickly growing louder. Heads turned as people scanned the horizon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ashley's small voice broke the tension. "Planes! Look, planes!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Several black dots appeared on the horizon, swiftly growing larger as they approached. The distinct shape of black helicopters emerged, their sleek frames cutting through the sky in perfect formation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ashley's eyes widened with excitement as she began counting aloud, her tiny fingers pointing upward. "One, two, three, four, five..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The count continued as dozens of identical black helicopters roared overhead, their powerful rotor downdrafts sending grass and trees into a wild frenzy. The scene was surreal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Axel and Asher froze. These helicopters were not theirs, which could only mean one thing: reinforcements had arrived&mdash;and they weren't on their side.</span></p><div class="pagination">
