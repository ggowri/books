  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh? What's so special about it?" Alexander asked, his curiosity piqued.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The clerk couldn't hide his envy as he explained, "Most Outer Court disciples get bronze tokens, you know? There are only a few hundred people with silver ones like this, and you've gotta be either a level-four warrior or some kind of prodigy to snag one."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He continued, getting more animated, "With a silver token, you automatically rack up a thousand martial virtue points every month, plus there are all these other sweet perks you'll figure out once you hit level four."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Martial virtue points?" Alexander leaned in. "What can I do with those?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The clerk was happy to spill everything he knew. "Man, you can trade them for all sorts of stuff. Hit up the Treasure Hall for weapons and armor, swap them for martial arts manuals in the Manual House, or even get yourself some sweet spiritual mounts from the Beast Lodge. If you're just after cash, the Finance Office will give you twenty coins per point..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How do I earn these points?" Alexander asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, there's tons of ways," the clerk replied. "Breaking through to new martial arts levels, helping people out like a hero, defending the nation, conquering the Thirty-Three Stage, ranking high in tournaments... Heck, you can even straight-up buy them with enough money or treasures."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they walked through the Martial Virtue Hall, the clerk pointed out a massive stone tablet that stretched several stories high along one wall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"See that? That's the Martial Arts Ranking in Outer Court," he explained, gesturing enthusiastically. "Lists the top hundred disciples by power level. The higher up your name is, the more powerful you are!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He smiled and explained smoothly, "Every new Outer Court disciple can claim their welcome package from the Manual House and Treasure House."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander figured it was getting late anyway. The welcome goodies could wait until another day&mdash;no rush there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Right now, he needed to head back to Emerald Manor before Logan started worrying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He gave the clerk a quick, respectful bow and made his way home.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, at the examination hall in the Dominion Church's Outer Court, things were getting interesting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A young man showed up with an elderly attendant in fancy clothes. The young man was wearing this expensive silk robe, but he looked rough&mdash;pale as a ghost, with beady eyes, droopy eyebrows, and a flat nose. It was Julius Wetherall, the precious young sir of the Marshal's Mansion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Finn, hand over our golden pass," Julius ordered his well-dressed attendant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Right away, sir."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finn immediately pulled out a palm-sized golden token from his robes and presented it to Declan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Declan checked it out. The front had this incredibly detailed engraving of soldiers marching to battle, thousands of troops looking all majestic and stuff. On the back, there was just one character carved deep into the metal&mdash;Exempt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After looking it over, Declan passed it to Huxley and Fermin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Declan and Huxley shared a knowing look, then glanced at the sickly-looking rich young man. Both of them let out heavy sighs before standing up and heading for the door without another word.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wait, where are you going?" Julius panicked, shouting after them. "Sir, please come back! Sir?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Keep it down!" Fermin snapped. "This isn't someplace where you can just cause trouble. The sign means you can enter the Dominion Church's Outer Court&mdash;nothing more, nothing less."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julius shot Fermin a sideways glare. "Listen up, Mr. Schneier," he said. "My father shed blood on the battlefield and barely escaped with his life to earn this golden pass from the King. It gets me out of trials, death sentences, and any punishment you can think of. You wouldn't dare touch me..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a cold snort, Julius turned on his heel and walked away, Finn trailing behind him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fermin let out a heavy sigh. "Man, the things parents do for their kids..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The whole mess started when Julius nearly got his head blown off, followed by that humiliating beating from Jeffrey, the governor of Darwin Court.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sure, his family had enough medicines to heal him up in a day, but the incident left some serious emotional scars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Something about that experience must have flipped a switch in him. Now he was suddenly all about proving himself and bringing honor to the family name.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When the Dominion Church's Outer Court announced they were recruiting lay disciples, Julius jumped at the chance to join the selection process.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His father, Marshal Madden Wetherall, was over the moon, convinced his son was finally getting his act together.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What parent wouldn't support their kid trying to better themselves? Especially since Julius was their only heir in three generations.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Madden knew the truth. Julius had only managed to become a level-one warrior thanks to their family's top-tier instructors and a mountain of magical medicines. There was no way Julius could handle the Thunderclap Bronze Men. Madden was seriously worried his son might not make it out alive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After much deliberation, Madden went all in, pulling out the world's only golden pass to secure his son a spot in the Dominion Church's Outer Court.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander had just stepped out of the Teleportation Plate when he spotted a huge crowd gathered at the front gates of Emerald Manor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leading the pack were the three supervisors&mdash;Nathan, Logan, and Jalen&mdash;with a swarm of workers buzzing behind them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yo, it's Alexander!" Jalen shouted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Logan rushed forward and wrapped Alexander in a bear hug. "Dude, you're back! Word is you crushed that selection process!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
