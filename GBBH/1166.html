  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"First, you said this bar was yours, and now it belongs to the Ultimate Alliance? You really thought you could act tough in front of me? Bad move!" Alexander pressed his foot down harder, making Preston scream and beg for mercy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Preston lay there paralyzed from the beating, writhing and moaning on the floor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone around them just stared, </span><span>stunned</span><span>. Alexander was brutal, and he clearly didn't give a damn about the Ultimate Alliance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The bar went dead silent except for Preston's agonized groans.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander looked down at Preston, his eyes cold as ice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Preston could feel the killer intent rolling off him and started screaming.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Please don't kill me! I was wrong. I'm sorry! Please, let me go!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's lips curved into what looked like a friendly smile, but to Preston, it was like the Grim Reaper beckoning him closer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is it. I'm done for," Preston thought. </span><span>He trembled so hard</span><span> that</span><span> he wet himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander grabbed a bottle from nearby and smashed it in half with a loud crack, ready to destroy Preston's arm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop!" The shout rang through the bar, followed by a crowd bursting through the entrance. The bar patrons erupted in cheers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Lancaster's here! And he brought Ultimate Alliance backup!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"With all these guys here, that punk is toast."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Preston's face lit up when he spotted the middle-aged man leading the charge. "Dad, help me! Please, help!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tristan Lancaster cut an imposing figure in his crisp black suit and white dress shirt, his polished leather shoes gleaming as he strode in with dozens of men at his back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he saw the </span><span>state</span><span> his son was in, rage flashed across his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Someone had the nerve to start trouble in this bar on Ultimate Alliance territory? They must have a death wish.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The dozens of burly men following Tristan were Ultimate Alliance foot soldiers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even as low-ranking members, each one radiated menace, their muscled frames and intense expressions marking them as well-trained fighters.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ha! My dad's here now. You're dead meat, you piece of trash!" Preston sneered at Alexander. "Nobody messes with Ultimate Alliance in </span><span>Loscity</span><span> and gets away with it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In one swift motion, Alexander jammed the broken bottle into Preston's right arm, then sent him flying with a powerful kick.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Preston went flying like a kicked soccer ball, tumbling several times before coming to a stop at Tristan's feet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ugh! Dad, get him! My arm's broken!" Preston wailed like a beaten dog.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sight was gruesome</span><span>&mdash;</span><span>a broken bottle had impaled his right arm completely, with white bone fragments visible through the bloody mess.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You bastard, how dare you</span><span>&mdash;</span><span>" Tristan roared as he charged at Alexander, but his words died in his throat. He froze, staring at Alexander with pure shock on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Preston, clueless about what was happening, shouted urgently, "Dad, what's wrong? Teach that guy a lesson now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A hard slap landed across Preston's face. He was so stunned he actually forgot about the pain in his arm. Holding his stinging cheek, he asked, "Dad, what are you hitting me for? He's the one you should be hitting!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Terror and rage crossed Tristan's face. Right now, he wanted nothing more than to kill his own son.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He'd recognized Alexander. His idiot son was practically begging for their whole family to be destroyed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Some son you've got there," Alexander said, his voice ice-cold. "Threatening me, harassing my woman. Don't you think he deserves what's coming to him?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tristan's whole body trembled in fear. He grabbed Preston by the collar and started slapping him repeatedly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You idiot! What have you done? Are you trying to get our whole family killed?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dad, I swear I didn't do it! This is all just a big misunderstanding. I never touched that woman. She's lying about me grabbing her!" Preston protested desperately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Plus, this guy isn't just insulting you. He's trashing the Ultimate Alliance. You need to teach him a lesson! Why are you hitting me instead?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tristan felt like he was about to cough up blood from rage as if the leader of the Ultimate Alliance needed to make up lies about his son.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Plus, he knew exactly what kind of person Preston was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In one fluid motion, Tristan pulled the dagger from his waist and slashed it deep into Preston's already injured arm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Preston's mouth dropped open, and his scream came out like an opera tenor hitting a high note.</span></p><div class="pagination">
