  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You can hypnotize?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The woman was taken aback, quickly biting her tongue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sharp pain jolted her awake, and with a deadly focus, she unleashed a terrifying killing intent that soared into the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The invisible aura surged like a tide, crashing over Alexander in waves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh? What kind of technique is this? Intriguing!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was intrigued and curious to see what this woman could do when fully unleashed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He became slightly more alert, acknowledging her pride.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Resisting is futile. Surrender and join me, and I'll let you go."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander offered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shut up! I, Rosalia Sugarman, must complete my mission!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosalia's katana suddenly gleamed, her invisible aura making the blade shimmer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a fierce cry, the blade was upon Alexander, faster than lightning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The razor-sharp edge seemed to slice through the air, cutting flesh. Even a Shadow Warrior like Augusta would struggle to withstand this blow, facing either death or severe injury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Not bad!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's eyes sparkled, and his desire to recruit Rosalia intensified.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The blade's arc stirred his hair, yet he remained casually standing there as if stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though Rosalia doubted Alexander would surrender, seeing him in this state filled her with joy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No matter his tricks, she would simply slice him apart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the last moment, Alexander finally moved, grasping a fruit knife from the table.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Using it like a sword, he thrust at Rosalia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was Alexander's first time employing a Warrior's technique. The Force surged powerfully, shattering the blade's arc and striking fiercely against her katana.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clang!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her katana snapped in two.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rebecca's hand throbbed painfully from the impact, trembling uncontrollably.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Incredible strength!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosalia stared in disbelief. No one from the Red Umbrella Group had ever broken her attack so easily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bang!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While she was still dazed, Alexander struck her again, sending her crashing to the ground, unable to rise for a long while.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was Alexander holding back; otherwise, she would have been gravely injured or worse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her mask had fallen away, revealing a stunningly beautiful young face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was a true beauty, with features that seemed painted, her shock and disbelief adding to her allure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander couldn't help but admire. Her charm was deeply intoxicating, every move capable of stirring a man's desire, even more so than Mary Moore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Impossible! I don't believe it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The stubborn Rosalia was still unyielding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smiled, beckoning her with a finger. "Not satisfied? Come at me again."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her eyes were filled with fury and determination.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, she leaped into action, the remnants of her katana glowing again, and then she vanished like a ghost.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When she reappeared, she was already behind Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a roar, her blade tore through the air, striking fiercely at Alexander's waist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosalia was elated&mdash;had she won?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But in the next moment, her expression changed drastically as she faced the phantom-like Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It turned out she had only struck a shadow. His speed had reached an unbelievable level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander sent her flying again with a powerful palm strike.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, he still held back; otherwise, Rosalia would have definitely been left injured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even so, she was in a sorry state, her once-pale face now flushed a bright red, momentarily unable to continue the fight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The remnants of her katana had flown into a corner, embedding deep into the floor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now it's your turn!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander turned, grinning at the two gray wizards.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One of the older wizards chuckled nervously, saying, "Mr. Hawthorne, please don't misunderstand. While our City of Sorcery has an alliance with the Red Umbrella </span><span>Group, we are not here to harm you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander laughed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You sneak into my home at this hour and say you're not here to harm me? What do you want then? I don't take in drifters."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two wizards felt awkward at his words.</span></p><div class="pagination">
