  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cloe furrowed her brow and ignored Alfred.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Bright, you were too late, and it delayed our meal."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfred smiled and said, "Yes, that was my fault. If I had known you were coming, I definitely wouldn't have been late. How about this, to show my apology, I'll treat you all."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He also glanced at Alexander, sizing him up from head to toe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do we need your charity? You'd better leave quickly," William scoffed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfred's expression immediately clouded over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One of Alfred's companions stepped forward and shouted angrily, "What do you mean by that? Mr. Bright kindly invited you to dinner, and you're being so rude. This is too much.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you think we'll be intimidated just because you are from the Brilliant Group? Mr. Bright's father is a shareholder of Sunrise Group. Without </span><span>Louvian</span><span> Port, Treasure Island can't ship goods.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"With just one command from Mr. Bright, your little island might not even receive basic supplies."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The guy's voice was loud enough for everyone to hear clearly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this point, William fell silent and looked at Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although he wanted to teach Alfred a lesson, he didn't dare disrupt Alexander's plans. If they offended a big shot from Sunrise Group, they would be in trouble if they couldn't use </span><span>Louvian</span><span> Port.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander couldn't help but laugh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Isn't Sunrise Group part of the Chapman family? The chairman is named Karson, which has nothing to do with you, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sarcasm in Alexander's tone was obvious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfred frowned and asked, "Who are you? Who gave you the right to speak here? My dad is a shareholder in Sunrise Group. Don't you believe me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's gaze turned icy. "We're here for food, not for your boasting. No matter who you are, get out of Treasure Island."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfred trembled with anger. He had never been publicly insulted like this before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're seeking death! Ms. Cloe Bryant, teach this guy a lesson immediately until I'm satisfied. Otherwise, I'll have my dad prohibit any ships heading to Treasure Island </span><span>from docking at </span><span>Louvian</span><span> Port."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He yelled at Cloe, sounding like a cat whose tail had been stepped on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The hall fell silent, and everyone's attention focused on Cloe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alfred, you really are an idiot," Cloe scolded, a sharp glint flashing in her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfred, enraged, reached out to grab Cloe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Cloe Bryant, I warn you not to speak carelessly. You better think it through. Offending me means offending Sunrise Group, and then your Treasure Island is finished."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop! Who allowed you to touch Cloe?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander struck like lightning, gripping Alfred's wrist firmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfred winced in pain but forced a laugh. "Haha, no wonder you're so arrogant. You actually know some moves. Too bad you met me. I.</span><span>..ah</span><span>!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before he could finish his threatening words, a sharp pain shot through his right hand as Alexander twisted it into an unnatural position.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It hurts! Let go. Let go of me! How dare you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfred screamed while swinging his left fist to hit Alexander's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander laughed. "With your level, you dare to attack me? Kneel down."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He kicked Alfred's knee, causing him to drop to the ground, howling in pain immediately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My hand. My leg. It's broken."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfred was drenched in cold sweat, beads of perspiration rolling down his forehead. he was in so much pain that he could hardly speak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who are you? How dare you hit Mr. Bright?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't you know that all the supplies for Treasure Island must pass through </span><span>Louvian</span><span> Port?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfred's companions finally reacted and hurried to support him while pointing fingers at Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander shook his head, finding these people exceedingly foolish.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even if Karson were here, he would have to bow down to me, let alone you insignificant underlings."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's tone was intimidating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those who had been shouting were stunned, thinking, "He is young, but how can he boast so much?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander took out his phone and called Karson, inquiring whether there was someone surnamed Bright on their board.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After hanging up, he smiled at Alfred, "You're Alfred, right? Your dad is indeed an executive at Sunrise Group, but unfortunately, with his meager shares, he can't even enter the board of directors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And soon, your dad won't even be a member of Sunrise Group."</span></p><div class="pagination">
