  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander glanced around the casino floor, a confident smile playing on his lips. His sharp eyes quickly sized up the action, effortlessly discerning who was destined to win and who was set to lose.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Every alluring female dealer had her own arsenal of tricks&mdash;some relied on skillful sleight of hand, while others leaned on advanced technology hidden in plain sight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was no secret: most gambling was rigged. The house always ensured its bottom line. Occasionally, though, a true gambling prodigy would appear, winning big before slipping away. And then there were the legends&mdash;those rare, masterful gamblers capable of taking down an entire casino.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Casually, Alexander draped his arm over Norma's waist, his hand resting comfortably on her soft, curvaceous hips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Norma's smile was tight, masking her discomfort. She needed Alexander's help and didn't dare let her irritation show.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander chuckled inwardly. Norma was cunning, sly as a fox. But even the craftiest fox couldn't escape the hunter's trap.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Having pieced together bits of Norma's true intentions, Alexander let his guard down slightly, amused by the game they were both playing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Just then, a man rushed over, his face flushed with urgency.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Boss! That guy is back. He's on a winning streak again&mdash;already taken two hundred million dollars. And this time, it looks like he's not stopping. What should we do?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The man hesitated, then added in a hushed voice, "Should we... take care of him?" He made a throat-slitting gesture.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Norma frowned deeply.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"A gambling master?" Alexander asked, raising an eyebrow with an intrigued smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Norma's expression shifted. Her face flushed momentarily, then returned to its usual composed demeanor. She let out a slow breath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne, I apologize. Something urgent has come up that requires my attention..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"No need to apologize," Alexander said smoothly, his tone laced with curiosity. "In fact, I'd like to see this gambling master in action myself."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Norma hesitated for only a moment before nodding. Together, they entered a private elevator and ascended to the casino's top-floor surveillance room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The walls were lined with dozens of LCD screens, forming an expansive mosaic of live footage from every corner of the casino.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"In this casino, we have over a thousand surveillance cameras," Norma explained as they entered. "They provide round-the-clock, comprehensive monitoring of every guest and every inch of the property."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander smirked slightly. If this opponent was truly a gambling master, no amount of surveillance would reveal their methods.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As Norma stepped into the room, everyone inside rose to their feet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Good evening, Boss!" they said in unison.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Have your seats and get back to work," Norma said briskly, her commanding tone leaving no room for delay.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Norma led Alexander to the largest screen in the room, which displayed a live feed from one of the casino's VIP suites.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne, I might need your advice on how to handle this situation," she said, glancing at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The staff exchanged curious looks. Their boss rarely treated men with such deference. Who was this Alexander that he warranted such courtesy?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Norma gestured toward the screen, her expression growing serious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This is one of our VIP rooms," she explained. "To even qualify as a VIP, a guest must spend at least one million dollars. It's no exaggeration to say that each VIP here is worth hundreds of regular customers."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The screen showed a room so lavish it could rival the finest presidential suites in the world. In the center was a luxurious card table surrounded by seven men engaged in a high-stakes poker game. Each was flanked by a glamorous, provocatively dressed woman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander's gaze swept across the scene, lingering briefly on a few familiar faces&mdash;a famous actor, a chart-topping singer, and a prominent entrepreneur. He hadn't expected to see them here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Norma pointed at the screen, her tone sharpening. "That white-haired man at the center is the one causing all the trouble."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her playful, coquettish demeanor from earlier had vanished, replaced by a tiger-like ferocity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander leaned in, studying the man on the screen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At that moment, the actor, singer, and entrepreneur threw their cards down in frustration. They rose from the table, their expressions sour as they stormed off, clearly having lost heavily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander's interest deepened.</span></p><div class="pagination">
