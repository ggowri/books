If she was not careful, people would be able to see under her skirt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then he saw her slender waist and plump breasts, which made men salivate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This woman not only had a sexy figure but also had delicate and beautiful facial features.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If he were an ordinary man, he would be very excited and thrilled at this moment, but Alexander was very calm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This woman seemed very polite, but Alexander could see at a glance that she was a little arrogant, as if she looked down on him a little.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander was even more confused because every woman who saw him today respected him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But this woman seemed so superior; there must be a reason for that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This woman faced Alexander fearlessly, raised her chin slightly, and smiled proudly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Sir, I'm the manager of this store, Sofia Morgan. If you need anything, you can tell me directly."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Sofia's attitude was neither humble nor arrogant, and there was a hint of coldness in her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander said expressionlessly, "I want to see your most expensive perfume. Money is not a problem. But your staff needs to be better trained. They wasted my time."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Sofia said to herself, "The most expensive perfume?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Yes, the most expensive one. You are not going to waste my precious time too, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing Alexander's impatient words, Sofia looked at him twice, and the contempt and displeasure in her eyes became more obvious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Sir, it's not that I don't want to show it to you, nor am I afraid that you can't afford it. It's just that the sales of that perfume are too good, and it has been out of stock for a while."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander snorted coldly and said, "In this case, I won't buy anything."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He turned around and was about to leave. There was something wrong with this store, so Alexander decided to go back first and then send someone to investigate it thoroughly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Sofia suddenly looked surprised and ferocity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She had been feeling that Alexander looked familiar, but she couldn't remember where she had seen him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The moment Alexander turned around, Sofia suddenly remembered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was Alexander!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He looked the same as he was in the photo she had seen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He now had a better temperament and his words and deeds were more casual, so although she was well-trained, she didn't recognize him at first sight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Sir, please wait a moment!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Sofia trotted to stop Alexander, and the smile on her face became very gentle and kind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Sir, please wait a minute. I can get you a bottle from another store. Please wait a moment."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After that, she turned around, took out her phone, and started sending messages.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Sofia deliberately showed off her sexiness in front of Alexander, twisting her waist and swaying her round buttocks rhythmically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She was like a ripe peach, tempting men to take a bite.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander sneered secretly. He wanted to see what Sofia was up to.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Sir, our other store has a more complete range of styles, and there are many perfumes that are not available here. How about I drive you there to buy them?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As Sofia explained, she approached Alexander with a smile, using her charm to seduce Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her charming smile and eyes seemed to tell Alexander that as long as he followed her, he would have a romantic encounter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander was secretly disdainful in his heart but pretended to be very interested.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Okay, then take me there."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He now wanted to see Sofia's background and what tricks she was playing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Sir, please follow me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Sofia happily led the way in front, deliberately twisting her waist greatly, causing her plump and round buttocks to swing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She came to Loscity to find an opportunity to get close to Alexander and was making a plan. She never expected that Alexander would come to her on his initiative.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The most expensive perfume was modified by her to have the effect of charming men. It was very good in testing, but it did not last long enough.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The two of them came to the underground parking lot one after another and got in the car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander didn't say anything but closed his eyes to rest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Sofia drove to another store, but the door of this store was tightly closed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander sneered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was business hours now, and it was too early for this store to close. It must be arranged by Sofia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But why did she do that?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Was she looking for an opportunity to seduce him?</span></p><div class="pagination">
