  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The air vibrated with a unified, thunderous declaration that left every ear ringing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Astonishment swept through the crowd. The enigmatic figure behind the mask was none other than the new chairman of the Saint Group.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Hadn't Ryan secured the chairman's favor and been appointed as the vice president?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Had Ryan deceived them all?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Eyes filled with furious betrayal turned towards Ryan and Jane.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jane stood frozen, her eyes wide with incredulity. Yet, the reality unfolding before her was undeniable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ryan's mind was a void. His voice was quivering as he confronted the truth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You're the chairman? But Ms. Hollister told me I was to be the vice president. Why do you tease me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At this juncture, his mind was a whirlwind of countless questions.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Anne offered a scorn. "When did I ever say you were vice president?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ryan was choked into silence. The bitter truth dawned on him; he had been outmaneuvered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The entire room erupted into an uproar. A wave of fury swept through the crowd.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">These were the elite of Loscity's high society, yet they were collectively duped by none other than Ryan.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Many had lavished Ryan with gifts to win his favor.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Liar! You're nothing but a fraud! Return my gifts!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"How dare you invoke the name of the Saint Group chairman for your fraudulent schemes? You must truly have a death wish."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Amidst the uproar, Alexander raised his hand, and silence fell like a curtain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The crowd watched him with reverence in their gaze. None dared to meet his eyes behind the silver mask.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A supreme aura surrounded Alexander, whose presence seemed to suffocate the air around him. It was as if he were an emperor perched on high.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"As of this day, I decree a ban on the Hawkins family, driving them to bankruptcy. Let it be known, anyone who engages in commerce with the Hawkins family will be considered an adversary of the Saint Group!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The declaration caused another wave of murmurs.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Everyone was in solidarity to fight against the Hawkins family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ryan's emotions spiraled into a mix of anxiety and rage. His family's fortune had only just surpassed the 100 million dollars mark. How could they possibly endure a boycott from such a coalition of power players? He feared that within a mere month, his family would be utterly ruined.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He pleaded, his voice breaking, "I've done you no wrong. Please, spare my family..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander snorted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I promised to see your family in ruins. I'll let you taste the bitterness of loss and watch you writhe in despair. Only then will my vengeance be sated!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The revelation hit Ryan and Jane like a thunderbolt. Those words echoed from a past they couldn't quite place.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Anne rose, flinging a dossier at Ryan.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I've dug up all the dirt on you from over the years: tax evasion, setting others up, reckless driving, and deliberate harm to others. There's enough here to lock you away for decades.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Once you're in prison, someone will ensure you're well taken care of. That's why our dear chairman graciously provided you with this coffin in advance. I hope it meets your approval."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her smile, laced with malice, nearly stopped Ryan's heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ryan's body shook uncontrollably as fear gripped him. With a voice quivering with dread, he asked, "Have we met before? Do you hold a grudge against me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander's voice was frost as he replied, "Max, deliver him, his coffin, and his crimes to the authorities. Inform our friends inside to extend their 'warmest' welcome."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes, sir!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Max's voice boomed as a grim smile played on his lips. He waved at his subordinates.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Seven guards swarmed, forcing Ryan into the coffin, sealing the lid, and carting him off.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Boom!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Help! Jane, save me!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Inside the coffin, Ryan pounded his fists in desperation, and his frantic pleas echoed within the wooden confines as he begged for mercy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jane's once radiant face had drained of color, now ghostly pale. She gazed at Alexander with a mixture of shock and awe.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She thought, "Alexander had indeed spoken of the same words!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Could he be Alexander?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">No, it couldn't be!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This enigmatic chairman, with his supreme presence and a terrifying aura, could surely not be that loser Alexander!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She shook her head fiercely, convinced Ryan must have crossed the chairman of the Saint Group in some forgotten past.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander turned his gaze towards Jane. His icy eyes betrayed a flicker of complex emotions within him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He thought, "Despite the fact that the bond between Jane and I had withered away, there remained Ashley, our daughter, and my solemn vow made to Sir Fairfax."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His voice was devoid of warmth. "Why are you still here? Do you wish to share Ryan's fate?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jane felt as if she'd been struck by lightning. Her body swayed with the shock of her shattered expectations.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She had arrived with dreams of glory, only to leave with her world in ruins.</p><div class="pagination">
