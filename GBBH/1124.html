  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"T-They seem bigger..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lynn was panting and obviously aroused.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You are </span><span>amazing</span><span>. No wonder it takes so many women to satisfy your lust. Ava told me that women can help you improve your strength."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My long absence from Loscity keeps me from helping you. Let me help you today."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lynn's tone was seductive, and her pretty face flushed. She raised her face slightly and fixed her beautiful eyes on Alexander. Her gaze was captivating.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He held her in his arms and kissed her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their lips touched closely, and their tongues tangled...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Diaz, I know you like bathing in hot springs. This spa has just opened. It's quiet and not crowded, so it's perfect for you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A flattering voice rang out from not far away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon after, there was a chaotic sound of footsteps. A few people made their way over, surrounding a middle-aged man, Waylon Diaz, who had a large belly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey! Why is it him? Waylon Diaz... He is a client of mine in business. He has always had a crush on me and often pesters me..." Lynn explained, subconsciously hiding behind Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He patted her shoulder and comforted her, saying, "I'm here. Don't be afraid."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Waylon caught a glimpse of Lynn and exclaimed in joy, "Ms. Lynn Blackburn, why are you here? I've been looking for you for a long time. It turns out you are in Loscity. It is so difficult to find you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Waylon and his men strode over quickly and sized Alexander up wickedly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Diaz, do you know this beautiful lady?" a man asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Waylon nodded with a stern face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes. I have been pursuing Ms. Lynn Blackburn for a while, but to my surprise, she pretends to be serious but actually keeps a gigolo in Loscity!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The men around him burst into laughter, but the sight of Waylon's dark face immediately prompted them to put on a fierce look.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Lynn Blackburn, are you free tonight? How about having dinner and drinking with Mr. Diaz? Don't worry. We will be kind to you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah! Don't you sell jewelry? We'll buy all your goods!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Several men grew excited and stared at Lynn lustfully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Waylon approached her, as if trying to get a better look.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lynn immediately wrapped herself in a bath towel, which was wet and stuck to her body, revealing her curvy figure. Her long, smooth legs were completely exposed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sensing their malicious gazes, she quickly hid behind Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You are disturbing us. Get lost!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's tone was extremely icy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No man could stand to be disturbed at that time and see those men ogling his women.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who the hell are you? Do you know who I am?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Waylon shouted arrogantly, "I am the chairman of the Universe Group, with a net worth of tens of billions of dollars. I have a close relationship with the leader of the Ultimate Alliance, who dominates Loscity. Are you courting death?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander </span><span>suddenly l</span><span>augh</span><span>ed</span><span> out loud.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Y</span><span>ou have a close relationship with the leader of the Ultimate Alliance? </span><span>That</span><span>'</span><span>s a good one</span><span>!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Waylon flew into a rage and roared, "What are you laughing at? Believe it or not, I can get the people from the Ultimate Alliance here with just one phone call."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander restrained his laughter and yelled coldly, "You are not welcome in Loscity. Get out of here before I make a move!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fuck, you are so arrogant!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No woman that Mr. Diaz likes can refuse him. You'd better be sensible and leave now, or you will get beaten."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>W</span><span>e'll kill you and bury you somewhere where no one can </span><span>even </span><span>find your body!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those lackeys threatened Alexander, and their breath reeked of alcohol, which suggested that they had drunk before coming.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They </span><span>kept </span><span>fix</span><span>ing</span><span> their evil eyes on Lynn</span><span>, their smell enveloped them</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ignore them. Let's go."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lynn was about to leave with Alexander, but Waylon stopped her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He approached her and teased with a wicked grin, "Ms. Lynn Blackburn, you can't escape today. I used to believe that you were pure and different from other women. However, you are also a slut!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Accompany me obediently today, or both of you will be in trouble."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With a lewd expression, Waylon reached out for Lynn's plump breasts.</span></p><div class="pagination">
