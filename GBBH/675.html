  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a while, Beverly woke up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She looked at Alexander in horror. "You... You just promised not to kill me..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander looked at her coldly and said nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beverly got more scared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Please don't hurt me. Don't kill me. I'm willing to do anything, really!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beverly cried.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander pinched her chin and forced her to raise her head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said, "You are in league with the Mafia and want to kill me. I don't think I should let you go."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beverly said, "I'm sorry! If I knew you were so powerful, I would not form an alliance with Paxton. I'm sorry..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beverly burst into tears. And her plump breasts trembled continuously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She said, "Please... I can do anything you ask me to do..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander said, "Anything?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander pressed one of her breasts. There were red finger marks on her breasts from the exertion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beverly immediately understood. Instead of being afraid, she burst into tears of joy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was afraid that Alexander would not accept her body. As long as Alexander needed her, Beverly would be willing to be treated like a slave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander sat down on the bed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said, "Beg me! I may take you as my slave and then you can be free. If you </span><span>don't</span><span> please me, I will torture you in ways you can't imagine and make your life a living hell."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beverly was shocked and knew that Alexander was serious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had long been aware of being a slave and quickly knelt in front of Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Master, please sleep with me," she said, trembling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You don't show any sincerity at all. Haven't you watched movies or TV?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander looked at her coldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't kill me. Give me another chance, and I will do better."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beverly shivered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander said, "Okay, this is your last chance. Think about what you should do. If I'm still not satisfied later, I will be rude to you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beverly frantically tried to recall all the </span><span>most obscene</span><span> words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You haven't figured it out yet? Are you trying to test my patience?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was obviously impatient.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beverly said, "Master, please teach me a lesson. I am a slut. I want you! I was born for you. I'm willing to let you treat me like a toy!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She blushed and said these shameless words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, her heart beat faster, and she became excited.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beverly thought, "If I can say such despicable words, what else can't I do?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She knelt in front of Alexander and kissed his feet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander chuckled and reached out to pinch her breasts with such force that Beverly almost cried out in pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she forced herself to endure it. And gradually, she felt a strange kind of pleasure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was filled with violent emotions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ever since he improved the Force through working with women, a lot of negative emotions had slowly accumulated in his heart. If he didn't vent them, he would become depraved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Alexander was very gentle to the women around him and would not bully them, including Rosalia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Beverly was different. She was his enemy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander had always adhered to the principle of removing the source of the trouble. Since he made an exception and did not kill her, he must charge some interest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beverly had to selflessly sacrifice her body and endure Alexander's venting of negative emotions in exchange for staying alive. This was the interest she had to pay.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander pressed Beverly's head. She was holding his genitals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It made Beverly retch continuously, but she had to endure it. Even with tears, she could only maintain a smile and responded actively.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, Alexander let her go with a chuckle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beverly burst into tears, but she had no resistance at all. Instead, she felt a strange pleasure in her heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How was it? Was it fun?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander asked proudly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Beverly's head was buzzing, and she hadn't recovered.</span></p><div class="pagination">
