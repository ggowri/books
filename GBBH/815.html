  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ava also sensed that something was wrong. Although she didn't have children and wasn't a doctor, the way the baby was crying was clearly not right.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The cafe staff gathered around, comforting the woman, Phyllis, and asking if she needed to go to the hospital.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ava asked with concern, "Ma'am, do you need me to take you to the hospital?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, the baby's face turned black, and she began to convulse violently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Phyllis was in a panic, screaming frantically, "My baby, what's wrong with you? What's happening?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander's eyes flashed with confusion as he placed his hand on the baby and channeled the Force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He could see that there was a surge of black blood within the baby.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But this black blood was different from any poison or witchcraft insects he had seen before; it clearly had nothing to do with witchcraft.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "Is it caused by some disease?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>While using the Force Cure, Alexander was deeply puzzled, pondering the situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ma'am, has your daughter recently been injured or eaten anything she shouldn't have?" he asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Under Alexander's treatment, the baby girl gradually stopped crying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Phyllis, seeing the effectiveness of Alexander's treatment, became very happy and quickly replied, "She's been fine recently... But this morning, on my way from the suburbs, I accidentally fell and there was a pool of foul-smelling black blood on the ground."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Could it be that my daughter touched a bit of that black blood? Is that why she's showing these symptoms now?" she added.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After she finished speaking, everyone except Alexander and Ava was so frightened that they quickly moved away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Since the plague, the people of Loscity had become much more vigilant. It was clear that the baby girl had been infected with something.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"A pool of black blood in the suburbs?" Alexander pondered, gradually connecting this incident to the living dead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "Could that pool of black blood have been left behind by the living dead?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Phyllis asked anxiously, "How is my daughter? Is there anything seriously wrong with her?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander remained silent. He had expended quite a bit of Force to eliminate that black blood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The infant girl also returned to normal and fell into a deep sleep.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He said, "Your daughter is fine now. Just be more careful in the future."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Phyllis was overwhelmed with gratitude and bowed repeatedly to Alexander in thanks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander smiled and waved his hand, then he returned to his seat and sat down, his mind preoccupied with the matter of the black blood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At the same time, Ava blushed and felt embarrassed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She realized she had misunderstood Alexander and felt terrible about it, wishing she could slap herself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With this little incident, people around were curiously discussing Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ava couldn't help but ask, "What is black blood? Is Loscity going to have another epidemic?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander thought for a moment and ultimately decided not to reveal the matter of the living dead, not wanting to scare Ava.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He had been quietly preparing, and if that day ever came, he would definitely be able to protect the people he cared about.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As for the rest, he was not God and couldn't save everyone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing that Alexander didn't say anything, Ava thought he was angry and quickly went over to pout. "I'm sorry, I misunderstood you just now. I thought you were a pervert, looking at a woman breastfeeding her baby."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander couldn't help but laugh and pinched her firm, round butt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Hey! People are watching us." Ava pouted, her pretty face flushed, making her even more alluring.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After finishing their coffee, they came out and were about to get into the car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A group of five or six young men with red or yellow hair, wearing various strange accessories, approached, holding bottles of alcohol and reeking of it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Their faces, necks, and arms were covered in tattoos, and they walked with a swagger, behaving as if they were invincible, much like crabs moving sideways.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This girl is quite attractive. Why don't you come with us? We'll make sure you have a good time." The lead man stared at Ava, his eyes filled with greedy desire, wishing he could drag her away immediately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander frowned. Running into these hooligans really ruined his mood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He said coldly, "Piss off before I decide to take action!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Do you know who I am? This street is under my control. I'm from the Ultimate Alliance. Do you know the Ultimate Alliance?" Sanchez loudly threatened Alexander, his attitude extremely arrogant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His several companions also surrounded Alexander menacingly, ready to beat him up at any moment.</span></p><div class="pagination">
