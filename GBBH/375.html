  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A warm rush flooded between Ava's legs as the sound of staff voices and footsteps echoed from outside, making her wish she could sink into the ground from embarrassment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Knock, knock, knock!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Open up! Open the door!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bernard banged on the door furiously, yelling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander held Ava firmly, chuckling. "Ignore him. Someone outside will take care of it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You little rascal, stop... What if someone comes in?" Ava whispered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Torn between worry and anticipation, Ava felt an even stronger wave of pleasure surge through her, leaving her completely flushed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smirked mischievously, squeezing her curves. "Right here..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Little rascal, you're always bullying me," Ava pouted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava blushed deeply, feeling shy and flustered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Bernard's voice echoed from outside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ow! Ow... My leg! I hurt my leg. It hurts! Hurry, take me to the hospital..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The staff seized the opportunity and helped Bernard away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Knock, knock, knock!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Someone knocked on the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Blackburn, are you alright in there?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava replied sweetly, "I'm fine. You all can get back to work."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The people outside murmured an "oh" and then muttered among themselves before they finally left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They couldn't shake the feeling that something was off. Ava's voice sounded so different. It's none of her usual authority, more like a kitten in spring.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava decided to turn the tables, leaning down in full surrender...making Alexander shiver with excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander held her close, picking up the pace, his breathing turning heavy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a long moment, Ava raised her head, gazing up at Alexander with a sultry, slightly reproachful look.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, are you going to keep bullying me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander chuckled and gently dabbed at the corners of her mouth with a tissue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You were so good... Did you enjoy it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava's face flushed, and she playfully bit him in response.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You little rascal! I'm done playing with you. I have tons of documents to sign!" Ava blushed as she got up, nudging Alexander aside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Red-faced, Ava stood and pushed Alexander to the side.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander wasn't going to let her go so easily. He wrapped his arms around her lush hips from behind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, alright, I won't bother you. You work on your files, I'll...keep myself busy."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop it! How am I supposed to work with you doing this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava found herself pressed over the desk as Alexander held her firmly in place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her black skirt slipped to the floor, revealing her pale, full curves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're really out of line...I'm going to punish you..." Ava huffed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was flustered yet indignant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander, unable to hold back any longer, moved over her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava breathed heavily, her movements in sync with his.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Little rascal! Why...why do you smell like another woman's perfume? Did you see someone else before coming here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander hesitated for a moment, then quickened his pace and grew more intense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Gentler...you'll break me..." Ava whimpered, her body tingling from head to toe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava's body felt electrified as she collapsed onto the desk once more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm warning you... If you ever dare abandon me, I'll make sure you regret it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, is that so? Going to take me down? We'll see who takes who down today."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander flashed a devilish grin and channeled the Force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, Ava felt her entire body go numb and unable to move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her eyes sparkled with moisture, her face full of sweet resentment as she kept muttering, "Little rascal..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Over an hour later, Alexander was finally satisfied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava lay collapsed on the desk, her pale, curvaceous body flushed and glistening with dewdrop-like beads of sweat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander cradled her in his arms, reassuring her, "Don't worry, I'll never leave you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava shot him a half-scolding look.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You men are always eyeing one thing while thinking about the next. Not one of you is any good," Ava teased with a playful sigh. "But don't even think about ditching me because..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Because why?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander asked with a grin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmph! I won't tell you now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava just smirked proudly, keeping to herself the fact that the Godfather had already arranged for her to be Alexander's fianc&eacute;e.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Honestly, I'd love to get rid of that thing of yours, keep you from causing trouble for other women."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She playfully grabbed him below, giving a few teasing pinches.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander grinned mischievously. "Go ahead, if you really can bear to do it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, enough of that... Let's get serious for a minute," Ava sighed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava let out a small sigh, her expression growing stern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bernard dared to come after me because he's got the Red Umbrella Group and Satan backing him up. We need to be careful."</span></p><div class="pagination">
