  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Following the stream, Alexander began digging. In no time, he had carved out a large pit several yards wide and deep.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Next, he lined the hole with plastic sheeting, layering it four or five times. He covered the bottom with stones, then added several more layers of plastic on top.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rainwater quickly began to fill the pit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He laid a dozen logs across the top and spread another sheet of plastic over them, forming a makeshift cover.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, using some pipes he had found in a grocery store, he inserted a drainage outlet at the lower end of the pit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Water flowed smoothly through the pipe. He attached a spigot, and their simple reservoir was complete.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander also fashioned a basic filtration system using mesh screens from the store. Rainwater, once filtered, became noticeably clearer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He dropped purification tablets into the bucket. Before long, the murky rainwater transformed into clean, usable water.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't drinkable yet, but once boiled, it would be safe for bathing, washing clothes, and even drinking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't throw away the empty water bottles or jugs," Alexander said. "With this reservoir, as long as it rains, you can keep boiling water and refilling them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This way, you won't run out of water for a long time."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He turned to Sally with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She froze for a moment, feeling both grateful and heartbroken.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She knew she couldn't make him stay. No matter how much she wished otherwise, she understood that he would leave her sooner or later.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had done so much for her, and she had no idea how to repay him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The rain continued for an entire week.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luckily, the air-raid shelter was on high ground. Otherwise, it would have been completely flooded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Watching the relentless downpour, Alexander couldn't help but worry. This wasn't the rainy season, yet the weather was behaving strangely. He had no idea what was causing the anomaly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He pondered it for a long time but found no answers. With a heavy heart, he turned back into the air-raid shelter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In one corner, the glow of electric lights pushed back the darkness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sally was busy working on a set of leather armor, cutting and shaping the thick hide Alexander had prepared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But mutant bison hide was incredibly tough. Ordinary needles couldn't pierce it. She had to use a hammer and a metal punch, striking the same spot a dozen times just to make a single hole.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, she threaded the pieces together with electrical wire. The finished armor looked crude and misshapen, but it was incredibly durable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>During the rainy week, Alexander had made several more supply runs. He had raided nearly half the stock from a local grocery store.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, one corner of the air-raid shelter was piled high with tools and materials. He had also found a temporary shelter at a construction site and hauled it back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After setting it up outside the air-raid shelter, he dug a simple septic tank and installed a squat toilet inside. At least the sanitation problem was solved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This rain has been going on for a full week..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Standing at the entrance, Alexander sighed as he gazed at the endless downpour.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sally's cheeks turned slightly red. She secretly prayed that the rain would never stop.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This past week, being with Alexander had been the happiest time of her life. She had found comfort, both emotionally and physically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What do you think? Doesn't look too great, does it?" Sally said, slipping on the leather armor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The oversized armor hung loosely on her, making her look like a child wearing a grown-up's clothes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was not only too big but also stitched together in a crooked, clumsy fashion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander chuckled, "Looking good isn't the point. Protection is what matters."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he swung his sword at her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sally let out a terrified scream. She had no time to dodge. The blade struck her squarely in the chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sword left a faint white mark on the armor but didn't even scratch the surface.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Not bad!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander nodded in satisfaction. He silently praised the mutant bison. Not only had it provided an abundance of meat, but even its hide was proving invaluable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Of course, he had held back. If he had used the Force, he would have cut through both the armor and Sally in one swing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That scared me... Scared me to death!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sally clutched her chest, breathing heavily, her ample curves rising and falling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, she grinned, running her hands over the armor. With this protective gear, her chances of surviving the apocalypse had just increased significantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even a mutant beast would struggle to claw through this hide.</span></p><div class="pagination">
