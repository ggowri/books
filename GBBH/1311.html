  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two melons were three to four times the size of ordinary Verdant Crown Melons. Typically, even the largest melons weighed around fifty pounds. Together, these two should be no more than three or four hundred pounds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cleveland felt relieved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He pointed at Alexander and shouted, "Just these two melons? Hah! The church requires each person to submit at least five hundred pounds of Verdant Crown Melons. Do you know that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We do," Alexander and Logan nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donald burst into laughter. "Ha! Since you know, you still dared to come? You two are unbelievably arrogant."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cleveland's face lit up. He bellowed, "Guards!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The soldiers immediately moved to seize them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's eyes flashed. He stood tall and shouted, "Wait!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Logan swayed slightly and said, "These aren't ordinary melons. According to the Energy-Gathering Technique, these are Melon Kings."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Melon King? Impossible..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There hasn't been a Melon King in years. The last one was grown... way back then."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd erupted in a frenzy. If not for the soldiers maintaining order, they would have rushed forward to see for themselves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You can check for yourselves."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donald's expression darkened. He turned and ordered the soldiers to weigh the melons.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Two soldiers stepped forward. As soon as they lifted the wooden crate, they staggered under the unexpected weight, nearly dropping it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Two more soldiers rushed in to help. Together, they pulled the Verdant Crown Melons from the crate and placed them on the scale. The first, slightly larger one, weighed 1,120 pounds. The second, slightly smaller, weighed 1,062 pounds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gasps filled the air. Then, cheers erupted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Melon King! Melon King! The Energy-Gathering Technique states clearly, any melon over a thousand pounds is a Melon King!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd surged forward, hoisting Alexander and Logan into the air and tossing them up in celebration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Children danced around, chanting, "They grew a Melon King! They grew a Melon King!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander and Logan grinned from ear to ear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cleveland's face turned ashen, his hands trembling. "A Melon King... A Melon King..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donald's features twisted in a fury. His eyes burned as he bellowed, "What do you think you're doing?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Reluctantly, the crowd set Alexander and Logan down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander pointed at Cleveland and said, "These are Melon Kings. Each weighs over a thousand pounds. Their effects are at least twice as strong as normal Verdant Crown Melons. Doesn't that meet the requirement?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donald shot a glance at Cleveland. Then he snapped, "There's no way you two could have grown a Melon King! You must have stolen them!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cleveland stammered, "Yes... You must have stolen them! Otherwise, why are there only two?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's right! You stole them! If not, tell us, how did you grow a Melon King?" Rory shouted at Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander fell silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After becoming a Level-One Warrior, his Force had grown stronger. While using the Energy-Gathering Technique to cultivate, the light from his emerald hoe had extended from less than a foot to a full foot and a half.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, he and Logan had worked tirelessly to ensure they could submit their harvest. Since they only had two melons, each absorbed a tremendous amount of Force. The more Force a Verdant Crown Melon absorbed, the heavier and more potent it became.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But most importantly, Alexander had noticed something unusual. The white glow from his emerald hoe contained faint streaks of gold. They were nearly invisible unless observed carefully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It turned out that after advancing to Level-One Warrior, his Force, combined with the golden energy in his chest, could refine metallic elements, strengthening his body. This meant that in the future, his muscles and bones would be tougher than those of others at the same level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the foot of the mountain, the two plots of melon fields had always been filled with hard stones rich in metallic elements. Verdant Crown Melons were highly sensitive to metal and had struggled to grow in that soil.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Through Alexander's daily cultivation and his Force's purification, the metallic impurities were gradually extracted from the stones. That was how these two Verdant Crown Melons had grown into Melon Kings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But revealing this secret would mean exposing the golden energy in his chest. He couldn't risk that. So, he remained silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Logan lost his patience. "We only have two melons because Cleveland and Rory used iron spears to stab the rest of our crop!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donald's eyes widened. He roared, "Nonsense! Bind them!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The soldiers charged forward. Alexander and Logan immediately took their stances, preparing to fight using Arhat Fist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cleveland and Rory beamed with satisfaction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A commanding voice rang out from the crowd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jalen emerged, accompanied by an elderly man and a young man. The newcomers were Nathan and Ben from the Residency Office.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ben bowed slightly to Donald and asked, "Donald, why are you trying to arrest these two gentlemen?"</span></p><div class="pagination">
