  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tell me! Did you poison the magic powder in the warehouse?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's voice cut through the tense air as he slammed his fist into the wall beside him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bang!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The concrete shattered, leaving a gaping hole. Shards flew in all directions, eliciting gasps from the crowd. People stumbled back, their eyes wide with shock and disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Pinned under the weight of his fear, Julian stammered, "I-I didn't poison it. Do you dare to kill me in front of everyone?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smiled coldly. "Courageous, aren't you? Don't worry&mdash;I won't kill you. But I'll make sure your life is worse than death."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He patted Julian's shoulder lightly, almost mockingly, before tossing him to the ground like a discarded rag.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian hit the floor hard, and an invisible force entered his body. The sensation was like thousands of razor-sharp blades tearing him apart from the inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Ahhh</span><span>! What are you doing to me?!" Julian screamed, writhing in agony, sweat pouring from his body in torrents.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The room fell silent, save for Julian's tortured cries. Everyone else stood frozen, stunned by the sheer ferocity of Alexander's actions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's gaze swept across the room, sharp and commanding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He is Julian Whitman," Alexander declared, his voice steady and authoritative. "He was the warehouse supervisor for Brilliant Group. The Vance family bribed him to poison the magic powder, causing harm to all of you!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Julian and the Vance family are responsible for this disaster. I swear to you, I'll make them pay&mdash;tenfold&mdash;for what they've done!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words sent a ripple through the crowd. Some looked skeptical, while others exchanged uneasy glances.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava, sensing the hesitation, stepped forward and raised her voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Think about it! The magic powder has been on the market for months without any issues. Why would something go wrong only now? It's obvious someone's trying to sabotage us!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd began to murmur. Slowly, doubt gave way to realization as heads started to nod in agreement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander leaned over Julian, pressing a foot onto his chest. "Talk. If you don't, you'll live in agony until you die."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian </span><span>screamed,</span><span> his voice raw with pain. "Ahh! I'll talk! I'll talk! Please, stop this! It was Asher! He gave me twenty million dollars to poison the magic powder!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He told me to create chaos and force you to hand over the formula!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Asher even bribed a kindergarten staffer to leak a recording of Ashley crying, and they handed it straight to Elliot!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian's trembling voice spilled the truth in a rush, desperate for the torment to end.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His confession was like gasoline on a fire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Vance family poisoned us?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We need revenge! My father died because of Asher!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That bastard Asher! He caused us huge losses. He has to pay!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angry voices filled the room as rage rippled through the crowd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander kicked Julian aside, withdrawing the invisible force that had been torturing him. Julian collapsed, gasping for breath, his body shaking violently. The pain had been unbearable&mdash;something he never wanted to experience again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander signaled to his men, who immediately stepped forward and cuffed Julian and Elliot together.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as the tension seemed to ease, Alexander's sharp eyes caught sight of a woman in the crowd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had noticed her earlier. Her slim figure and striking features had stood out, but now her pale face and nervous demeanor drew his attention even more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was trying to make a discreet phone call, her movements shaky.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without hesitation, Alexander strode toward her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was dressed in a crisp white blouse that clung to her curves, emphasizing her full chest. A sleek black miniskirt hugged her hips, and her long, toned legs shimmered under the overhead lights. Her high heels clicked against the floor, betraying her rising anxiety.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What do you want?!" she demanded, her voice icy but laced with fear. "I'm Lilian Lane, a reporter from the </span><span>Loscity</span><span> TV station!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your magic powder has devastated countless lives, leaving chaos in its wake. It's my duty to expose the truth. Are you going to stop me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shut up!" Alexander roared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His voice boomed, reverberating like thunder through the room. The force of it hit her like a physical blow, leaving her ears ringing and her composure shattered. She let out an involuntary scream, stumbling back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd </span><span>recoiled,</span><span> fear etched onto their faces. Alexander's presence loomed large, his voice still echoing in their ears, leaving them disoriented and subdued.</span></p><div class="pagination">
