  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Xavier struggled desperately, his voice cracking with fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Please, don't do this! My mom is Julia, a well-known gem dealer in </span><span>Loscity</span><span>. I'm begging you... don't skin me alive..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Panic had taken hold of him, and even Jennifer trembled at Evander's intimidating presence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My mom </span><span>has a lot of money</span><span>! She has tons of gems. If you let me go, I'll give each of you a gem!" Xavier shouted, his desperation spilling over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shut </span><span>up</span><span>! Who needs your gems?" Evander barked, raising his taser threateningly. It looked like he was ready to bring it down on Xavier's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wait!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A booming voice cut through the tension.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Evander was already committed; he wasn't about to pull back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as the taser was about to connect, Alexander appeared out of nowhere, his hand gripping Evander's wrist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne?" Evander gasped, his eyes widening in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Realizing the owner of this property had intervened, Evander quickly withdrew his hand, his bravado fading into respect</span><span> and fear</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could still feel the pain in his wrist as though the bones were cracking, a reminder of just how fast and powerful Alexander had been. Others might not have sensed the potency of Alexander's grip, but he was all too well aware of its ferocity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If they were on a battlefield, Evander couldn't imagine how badly he would've fared against someone like Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne, my apologies," Evander said, his tone shifting from aggressive to deferential.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The other patrol members, who had just moments ago been ready to pounce on Xavier, now bowed their heads in respect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evander continued, "These two deliberately trespassed on your private property. I was just about to take them in for questioning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Please r</span><span>est assured, our security at Grand Hyatt Estates is top-notch and impartial."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smiled, then turned his attention to Xavier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, both Xavier and Jennifer were left </span><span>in shock</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had never imagined that the person they had looked down upon was actually the owner of the Majestic Manor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Xavier's mind raced back to high school, recalling how he had bullied Alexander and even tried to provoke Alexander just moments ago.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His face turned ashen with dread. There was no doubt in his mind that Alexander would have his revenge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ale... Alexander, I'm so sorry! I... I was wrong. Please, can you forgive me for the sake of our past as classmates?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though Xavier had a reputation for being arrogant, he was quick to backtrack when faced with the reality of his situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was someone who could afford a billion-dollar mansion; he was definitely not to be trifled with.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he decided to hold someone accountable for this, skinning them alive would probably be the least of their worries.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander regarded him with a bemused expression, clearly enjoying the sight of the once-mighty rich kid brought low.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Alexander's silence, Xavier began to cry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, I was blind. I was foolish... please!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He slapped himself across the face twice, a gesture of self-recrimination that only added to the absurdity of the situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, Alexander broke the silence. "Your mom is a gem dealer?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hope flickered in Xavier's heart, and he nodded vigorously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes! She's famous in </span><span>Loscity</span><span>! The Phoenix Gemstone Establishment is our family business. If you ever need gems, just say the word, and I'll make sure you're taken care of!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a moment of </span><span>thought</span><span>, Alexander waved his hand at Evander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thanks for your efforts, but he</span><span> was</span><span> my classmate. He didn't do anything too terrible. Let's just let this slide."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evander hesitated, clearly frustrated, but he knew better than to argue with the owner of the Majestic Manor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Understood, Mr. Hawthorne."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Evander and the patrol team turned to leave, but not before shooting Xavier a final glare.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once the patrol team had finally walked out of sight, Xavier let out a long sigh of relief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His expression was a mix of gratitude and disbelief as he looked at Alexander. He couldn't believe that after ten years, the guy he used to bully had </span><span>become</span><span> into someone who could afford a mansion worth a billion dollars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, I can't thank you enough. If it weren't for you, I'd be in deep trouble right now. I was totally blind back at the entrance. Please don't take it to heart. Let me make it up to you&mdash;how about I treat you to a drink sometime?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Xavier's attitude had </span><span>changed completely</span><span>. Gone was the arrogance; in its place was a desperate eagerness to appease.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander </span><span>just</span><span> smiled</span><span> and remained</span><span> calm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>It</span><span>&rsquo;</span><span>s not a big deal</span><span>. This mansion actually belongs to the Saint Group; I'm just here to keep an eye on things."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander didn't want to flaunt his </span><span>wealth</span><span> or reveal the extent of his influence</span><span> before </span><span>Xavier</span><span>.</span></p><div class="pagination">
