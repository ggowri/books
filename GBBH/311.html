  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander understood that Oliver was trying to curry favor with him, deliberately leaking information.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you for your concern, Director. I will inform Miss Hansen."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne, let's set off for </span><span>Tijuanea</span><span> first thing tomorrow morning. My personal bodyguards will protect you tonight."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quentin waved his hand, and four burly men stepped forward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They looked at Alexander with arrogant expressions, their eyes filled with defiance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While they claimed to be providing protection, it was clear they were there to monitor Alexander, ensuring he didn't escape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Augusta, who had been silent, was displeased and coldly replied, "My boss' safety doesn't require your help. We're more than enough."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How dare you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The leader of the guards shouted angrily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is Mr. Thompson's order. Anyone who disobeys will face dire consequences!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Augusta's fiery temper flared up immediately as he swung a fist toward him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The force of his punch created a powerful wind, striking the man's cheek hard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're asking for trouble!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The big man snarled, throwing a punch of his own.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the two faced off, both Quentin and Alexander made no effort to intervene, clearly wanting to test each other's strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bang!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two enormous fists collided.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The shockwave sent both of them staggering back, each in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shadow Warrior!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quentin's expression changed, and he looked at Alexander with newfound seriousness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had previously thought Alexander's abilities were manageable, but he hadn't expected one of his subordinates to be a Shadow Warrior capable of matching one of their strongest Shadow Warrior.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How had he acquired power elixirs, especially with the Red Umbrella Group targeting him?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smiled slightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Thompson, I apologize for my subordinate's temper. Please forgive them."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quentin's face darkened as he nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne, you truly are full of surprises, even acquiring power elixirs."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His gaze shifted to Augusta, Marvin, and </span><span>Logan,</span><span> his expression increasingly grave. These imposing figures were clearly also Shadow Warriors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Rest assured, Mr. Thompson. I'll be ready for you to pick me up tomorrow morning."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Alexander left with his subordinates, exuding confidence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quentin's men still seemed reluctant, eager to pursue him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Enough!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quentin's sharp command quickly silenced them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Oliver reflected on the situation, impressed by Alexander's audacity. He was happy that he had secured a good relationship with him in advance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without a doubt, the future of </span><span>Loscity</span><span> would be shaped by Alexander's decisions!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander had Augusta escort Frank Fairfax to the hospital for recovery, then sent a message to Ava to let her know he was safe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He then dove into his room, feeling a bit uncertain about the upcoming trip to </span><span>Tijuanea</span><span> with Quentin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since Quentin's grandson needed witchcraft for survival, it couldn't be just a simple illness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thus, Alexander was eager to enhance his abilities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He resumed etching </span><span>Spellweave</span><span> Patterns on gemstones, and now he could consecutively inscribe over seventy patterns, getting closer to his goal of one hundred and eight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps due to not practicing for a few days, he initially struggled to find that ethereal feeling. Instead, he felt somewhat clumsy and shattered several decent gemstones.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, with Julia and Xavier managing the Ulysses family, he wasn't short on gemstones thanks to their help.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander began to meditate, channeling the Force and contemplating the cosmos, calming his mind to reconnect with that mystical, ethereal sensation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, he opened his eyes, picked up his carving tool and a gemstone, and focused intently on his work.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The graver twisted and moved swiftly...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Alexander's spirit was as calm as a serene lake, perfectly harmonized </span><span>with the universe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, the eighty-first </span><span>Spellweave</span><span> Pattern was completed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The aura of the eighty-one patterns suddenly merged, transforming the gemstone into something extraordinary.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Countless mysterious energies from the universe were drawn in, coalescing upon the gemstone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Excellent!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander admired the gemstone in his hand. It sparkled brilliantly like a rare treasure.</span></p><div class="pagination">
