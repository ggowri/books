  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Furiously, Maxine pointed at him and began to curse, "Son of bitch</span><span>es</span><span>! Did</span><span>n't</span><span> your mother teach you how to speak?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She went on a nearly ten-minute rant without repeating herself, each sentence more insulting than the last.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That middle-aged man's face turned </span><span>sullen</span><span> because of her </span><span>humiliation</span><span>, and his chest heaved rapidly since he was clearly infuriated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander almost laughed out but forcibly held it back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To be honest, he had never seen a woman with such a talent for </span><span>cursing</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Someone suggested to the middle-aged man, Husk Baylor, "Husk, why not teach this outrageous </span><span>bitch</span><span> a lesson </span><span>so she'll </span><span>watch her mouth?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxine didn't stop </span><span>her curse. I</span><span>nstead, she placed her hands on her hips and cursed even more fiercely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Husk? A guy with no manners like you should just</span><span> </span><span>kill yourself right now! Motherfucker, if you dare to touch me, I'll tear you apart! </span><span>Y</span><span>ou</span><span>r</span><span> smell </span><span>is more filthy</span><span> than shit</span><span>! Trash!</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxine's mouth was like a heavy machine gun firing at full power, cursing so fiercely that Husk almost lost his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fuck you! I'm going to kill you!" Husk roared, charging at Maxine like a raging </span><span>bull</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had always had a </span><span>bad</span><span> temper. </span><span>Plus</span><span>, </span><span>he had never </span><span>been humiliated by a woman in front of his subordinates like this before. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So embarrassing!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it got out, he would become a laughingstock to everyone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Go to hell!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Maxine reacted faster and kicked Husk in the groin when he lunged forward as if he were offering himself up to become her target.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a shrill cry, Husk fell to the ground and clutched his </span><span>dick</span><span>, rolling on the floor in pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come on</span><span>!</span><span> You want to kill me, right? I'll fight to the death with you today!" Maxine erupted, grabbing the nearby fruit knife and shouting fiercely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander felt like laughing out as he watched the humorous scene unfold from the side.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxine turned and glared fiercely at Alexander, saying, "What are you laughing at? You're the same as them</span><span>! Y</span><span>ou also want to get my father's patent</span><span>! </span><span>I won't let you get what you want!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander finally couldn't help but burst out laughing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxine was fuming but couldn't hit Alexander now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Husk stood up with the help of his subordinates.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He glared at Maxine with wide, menacing eyes and said, "You crazy bitch, I won't let you go</span><span>!</span><span> I'm going to take you back and </span><span>fuck</span><span> you for three days before sending you back to the Silver Shield Security for a reward</span><span>!</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Husk had never been insulted and then kicked to the ground by a woman before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You want to fuck me? I'll castrate you! If you don't believe me, keep coming closer, and you'll see if I can do it or not." Maxine gripped the fruit knife tightly with a firm tone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Alexander could see that she was pale. If a miracle didn't happen today, she might really be doomed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tears glistened in her eyes. She felt fear, anger, and resentment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get them all, now!" Husk bellowed, directing his men.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The dozen men immediately snapped back to their senses and charged at Maxine and Alexander viciously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Maxine looked very tough, she had only managed to kick Husk down just now because she caught him off guard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the dozen men pounced at her menacingly, she was frightened and hid behind Alexander, clutching his clothes pitifully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander shook his head. This woman was indeed clever since she knew he wouldn't stand by and do nothing</span><span>. So she </span><span>used him as a shield</span><span> to protect herself</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Alexander meant to intervene in the first place. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't </span><span>only</span><span> because he wanted to obtain the body armor technology</span><span> she mentioned. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These thugs </span><span>from Silver Shield Security</span><span> </span><span>dared to impersonate Ultimate Alliance members in Loscity. He was going to make these arrogant bastards pay the price.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Two burly men at the front both sneered as they reached for Alexander's arms to twist them and gain control over him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Alexander remained completely still, as if he </span><span>was a weak man</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Husk burst into a happy laugh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Watch out!" Maxine shouted urgently to warn Alexander to dodge. She then swung the fruit knife</span><span> and tried to help.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next second, everyone was dazzled. Alexander seemed to have moved, yet he appeared to be still standing in the same spot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two charging men were kicked flying as if hit by a speeding tank</span><span>. They </span><span>were smashed heavily into the wall, causing the entire room to quake a little.</span></p><div class="pagination">
