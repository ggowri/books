  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander watched with a mix of pity and disgust as the zombie crawled toward him inch by inch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crippled zombie caught the scent of fresh meat and opened its mouth in excitement, revealing yellowed, blackened fangs ready to tear into what it saw as its next meal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A heavy combat boot came down hard on the zombie's head with devastating force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under Alexander's boot, the zombie's supposedly hard skull crumpled like an eggshell, exploding on impact.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The </span><span>F</span><span>orce created a barrier that kept the disgusting black fluid from touching him as it oozed out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Killing zombies felt as mundane as crushing ants to Alexander&mdash;there was no thrill, no satisfaction in it anymore. With billions of zombies worldwide, plus countless mutant beasts roaming around, even if they lined up to die, he couldn't possibly kill them all single-handedly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was a small convenience store next to the hotel that stocked cigarettes, alcohol, and various food items.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander planned to raid it for supplies after finishing his current meal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He let out a heavy sigh, wondering how long he'd have to hold this position.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he had gone to Treasure Island instead, he'd be living it up right now, happy and comfortable&mdash;not stuck here dealing with this mess.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But thoughts of humanity's future kept him noble, at least for now. He had to find that old bastard Yinson.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Back in his hotel room, Alexander lit up one of the women's cigarettes he'd scavenged earlier. He took a deep drag and blew out a perfect smoke ring, watching it drift toward the ceiling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The cigarette had a cool, minty taste&mdash;different from the ones men usually smoked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander exhaled, watching the smoke curl and dissipate. He closed his eyes, the memory of his journey flashing before him. He had started as nothing more than a useless, live-in husband to the Fairfax family. Now, he was an Advanced Warrior, a force to be reckoned with.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The fact that he could now move freely through hordes of zombies and mutated beasts seemed almost unbelievable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander wiped his machete clean with a dirty rag, then rubbed his hands together before organizing his eggs and other supplies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, he noticed a massive column of smoke rising into the sky.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fires had become commonplace in Kylaville, but this one was different.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The smoke rose straight up like a menacing black dragon, adding another layer of destruction to the already apocalyptic landscape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Curious, Alexander headed to the hotel's rooftop to get a better look.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From his vantage point, he spotted several overturned vehicles in the distance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hundreds of zombies were already converging on them, forming a tight circle around the wreckage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was clearly a survivor convoy that had tried to escape the city but got surrounded on their way out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander knew the harsh reality&mdash;unless he had a heavily modified, high-powered vehicle, breaking through a zombie horde was impossible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Regular cars would just get swarmed, their windows smashed, and their passengers would be the food of the zombies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After spending three more days at the hotel, Alexander still hadn't spotted any high-ranking members of the Sakra Society, nor had he managed to make contact with Quentin, Gavin, or Norma.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander took a hot shower and changed into fresh clothes before settling into his rocking chair, gently swaying back and forth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At least the water treatment plant was still running automatically, so he didn't have to worry about the water supply for now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yesterday, he'd found a few bottles of wine, and now he unscrewed one of them, taking big gulps straight from the bottle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The subtle taste of wine rolling over his tongue improved his mood a bit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was safe and had food and drinks, but loneliness was starting to get to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He'd been stuck here alone for five whole days, with nothing but zombies and the walking dead outside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kylaville, once a bustling metropolis of millions, had become a city of despair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The average person had no chance of survival, let alone any hope for the future.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sometimes Alexander caught himself wondering what if he was the last person left on Earthia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if that made him ruler of the entire world, the solitude would drive him insane.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was why Alexander couldn't wrap his head around how stupid the Ghost's leadership must be to support Yinson in their quest for immortality.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, looks like I won't be finding Yinson anytime soon..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander sighed as he finished off the bottle of wine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He walked to the bedroom window and looked down at the zombies in the street. Most of them were still stumbling around aimlessly like before, but he noticed some alarming changes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Some zombies had become more agile, with larger, more muscular bodies and sharper claws. Others had gotten faster&mdash;about as quick as a normal person&mdash;and surprisingly nimble, even managing to hurdle over low obstacles like human athletes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander couldn't believe it. These monsters were evolving on their own now. How the hell were ordinary people supposed to survive this? If he could get his hands on Yinson right now, he'd slice him into pieces and feed him to the zombies himself.</span></p><div class="pagination">
