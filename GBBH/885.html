You go ahead&mdash;I'll catch up later."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marvin and Shadow were strong, but against such unusual foes, they might only be a </span><span>liability.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Got it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without hesitation, Marvin and Shadow pressed forward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They knew those two men were trouble and didn't want to hold their leader back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The older of the two men sneered wickedly, "It's a good thing we got here quickly! If we'd waited for the captain, these fools would've already broken through.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've heard Alexander is strong, but how strong? Are you going, or should I, or do we both go at once?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't underestimate him. They say even the sorcerers from the City of Sorcery have fallen to him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The younger brother smirked sinisterly, his expression like that of a venomous snake.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hah! Sorcerers are nothing compared to the ghost arts of </span><span>Risun</span><span>!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, ending up in my hands is just bad luck for you," Cyrus growled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Black energy surged around Cyrus as he stomped on the ground with immense force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Boom!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The ground shook violently, as if an explosion had gone off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Countless shards of stone, coated in eerie black energy, shot out in all directions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sound of destruction echoed as nearby cars were riddled with holes, none left intact.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dozens of these shards sped toward Alexander, faster than bullets.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet Alexander didn't flinch. An invisible wall of energy stopped every shard, sending them clattering uselessly to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, a sharp gust of wind whooshed through the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cyrus had ripped a lamppost out of the ground and swung it toward Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His strength was terrifying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bang!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a deafening crash, the lamppost missed its mark as Alexander suddenly vanished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Alexander reappeared, he was behind Cyrus, holding a gleaming kukri dagger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The blade flashed!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It struck Cyrus' chest, but no blood emerged.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The dagger was caught by Cyrus' muscles, failing to penetrate his bones or organs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Black energy surged across Cyrus' chest, his muscles and bones harder than steel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though Alexander had swung casually, the fact that he couldn't cut through Cyrus' body showed how powerful he was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn you! How dare you injure me&mdash;I'm the heir to the ghost arts!" Cyrus roared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cyrus bellowed in rage but retreated quickly, a glimmer of fear flashing in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander hadn't managed to cut him open, but Cyrus was still thoroughly shaken.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Heh, running pretty fast there," Alexander said with a cold smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a smirk of disdain, Alexander prepared to chase him down and finish him off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop right there!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Edmund, the younger brother, saw the situation turning against them and immediately started moving his hands rapidly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dozens of black throwing knives shot toward Alexander, tearing through the air with an ear-piercing whine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander vanished again as the knives buried themselves into a concrete wall, turning it into a honeycomb-like structure that wobbled precariously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cyrus and Edmund exchanged uneasy looks, regretting for the first time that they had taken the Mafia's lucrative contract.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This Alexander was not someone to mess with!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Edmund shouted in alarm, "Watch out!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But it was too late. Alexander suddenly reappeared behind Cyrus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He delivered a powerful punch to Cyrus' lower back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The force of the blow sent Cyrus' massive body flying like a cannonball, slamming into a wall and bringing it down in a cloud of dust and debris.</span></p><div class="pagination">
