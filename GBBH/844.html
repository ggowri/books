Although he liked women, being teased by a group of them in front of hundreds of people was embarrassing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Tsk, tsk, this one is big and dark, but the firmness isn't quite there," muttered the lead female examiner regretfully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marvin's chest heaved with anger; if Alexander weren't there, he would have slapped her by now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon, the hundreds of men in the hall were reduced to just a handful of about ten.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Those dismissed for not meeting the sixteen-inch requirement could only watch Keith and the others with envy, their eyes sharp with jealousy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At that moment, the female examiner took out a flexible ruler and waved it in front of everyone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The ruler whistled as it moved!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Congratulations to everyone who passed the first round. Now, it's time for the second round, the endurance test.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Like this!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She suddenly swung the ruler and struck a man's waistband, not too hard but firm enough.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ah!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The man let out a pained scream, clutching his waistband and rolling on the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Useless! I barely used any force. No endurance at all, and you still want to be an actor? Out, out, out!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The woman called for the unlucky man to be dragged out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander covered his mouth, almost bursting out laughing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The female examiner continued, tapping the ruler on the applicants' waistbands with quick strikes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Cries of pain and groans erupted throughout the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>That was the most sensitive area for men, and with a strike like that, most of them fell to the ground, clutching their waistbands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>One of them even passed out and was immediately carried out on a stretcher.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marvin had had enough and quickly hid behind Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Strangely, the female examiner who had been eyeing Marvin seemed frozen, as if under a spell, unmoving.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marvin sighed in relief, giving a bitter smile. "Boss, if I did something wrong, just tell me. Don't mess with me like this again."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander burst into laughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Keith was the last one to face the examiners.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Bring it on! I can handle it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The female examiner seemed to value Keith highly, saving him for the final test.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Smack!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The ruler struck, but Keith stood perfectly still, not even making a sound.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The woman didn't hold back, but Keith endured it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The pain that would have been intense was dulled by the Force, and Keith was able to withstand it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Yes!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Amazing! Impressive!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The examiners were immediately excited.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The woman, not giving up, struck two more times, but Keith remained motionless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The room buzzed with astonishment; they had never seen a man with such endurance&mdash;it was as if he were made of iron.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Keith's heart swelled with gratitude as he looked at Alexander, feeling as if he could do anything for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After the two rounds of testing, only five men remained.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The men eliminated in the second round weren't completely out of luck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They could still receive temporary offers from the Dragon Gang to play supporting roles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Supporting roles in these films were the lowest tier, where they could only watch without participating or having physical contact with the lead actress.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They were allowed to entertain themselves in front of the lead actress.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At most, during key moments, they could join in for some collective action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Participating in such scenes let them watch up close and came with decent pay.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>There was even a chance to eventually be promoted to a lead role, which made many willing to take the opportunity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The five men who passed both rounds would become lead actors in the films.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Of course, at first, they would act alongside lesser-known actresses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But the generous pay and the chance to be with different actresses every day made it feel almost regal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Eventually, they might even worry that their daily activities would outpace their stamina and nutrition.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Male actors in this line of work often lost twenty pounds within a year due to the frequency and suffered from malnutrition.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Some even developed conditions like nephritis or prostatitis.</span></p><div class="pagination">
