  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You're beautiful... very beautiful..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander replied calmly, without looking at her or saying anything more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He knew Maxine had developed feelings for him, but just hours earlier, he had been with Emma in the mountains. He didn't want to get entangled with Maxine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If he let the dark energy inside him grow any stronger, things could get out of hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Maxine was clearly dissatisfied with his lack of attention. She was edging closer to him, her curves nearly pressing against him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander couldn't help but smile wryly. He knew he had to put an end to her expectations before things went any further.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing his indifference, Maxine felt a pang of frustration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She didn't have much experience with relationships, and in the past, any man she showed interest in had quickly fallen in line.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Alexander remained unmoved, even cold toward her, leaving Maxine feeling rejected.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She muttered under her breath, "Alexander, if you think I'm beautiful, why don't you look at me more? You must be lying."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander sighed inwardly. This girl was really smitten, but he wasn't interested in returning those feelings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Let's go. The medicine's ready. I'll treat your dad."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He quickly changed the subject, grabbing the cup and heading for the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Maxine could only follow behind, resigned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the living room, Alvin was anxiously waiting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When he saw Alexander enter with a smile on his face, his expression immediately lit up with hope.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Drink this, then I'll start the treatment."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander handed Alvin the cup.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Without hesitation, Alvin drank the medicine in one go.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne, thank you for all your help. Whether this works or not, I'll never forget your kindness to our family, no matter what happens."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alvin still looked a bit skeptical, unable to believe that he could truly be free from the control of the drug.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander chuckled softly, not offering any explanation. He simply placed his hand on Alvin's forehead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A surge of powerful Force poured into Alvin's body, like a tidal wave, pushing the toxins out through his pores.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon, dark sweat began to bead on Alvin's skin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Emma and Maxine both smelled a pungent odor and quickly stepped back, covering their noses in shock, their eyes wide with horror as they watched Alvin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"How does it feel? Do you feel better?" Alexander asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Yes! It's amazing... it feels like I'm soaking in a hot spring. My whole body is warm, it's so comfortable."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alvin's face was one of pure relief, a soft hum escaping him, as if he'd been pulled from the depths of hell into paradise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander smiled, "Don't get too excited. We still need a little more time to completely flush the toxins from your system."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Yes, Mr. Hawthorne, don't worry. I'll follow your lead."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alvin's confidence was clearly growing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon, the dark sweat had stopped oozing from Alvin's skin, and the color of his perspiration returned to normal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Alright, you're all cleared of toxins, but your energy is still depleted. You'll need to rest."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander instructed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Thank you, Mr. Hawthorne! Thank you so much!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alvin was incredibly grateful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With a sudden movement, Alvin knelt before Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Tears streamed down his face, a testament to the depth of his sorrow. A man who rarely cried, he had finally reached his breaking point.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne, whatever you need, I'll do it. I'll take care of Silver Shield Security. I won't let you down."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alvin's voice was filled with seriousness and sincerity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander nodded in satisfaction. "Tomorrow, we'll go take over Silver Shield Security. Then, I'll need you to make a prototype of the All-purpose Bullet-resistant Jacket for me to see."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alvin nodded eagerly. "Silver Shield Security has samples. We'll go together tomorrow."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Dad!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Maxine rushed to hug her father tightly, a moment of warmth and unity shared between them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Emma joined in, wrapping her arms around them, the feeling of family togetherness filling the room with sweetness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But her gaze was fixed on Alexander, filled with something more complex.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander felt a flicker of discomfort, like a thief caught in the act. He couldn't bear to meet their eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the dead of night, silence blanketed the house.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander had returned to his room, showered, and was preparing to rest&mdash;there were still hours until dawn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Shh-shh-shh..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, Alexander heard the familiar sound of footsteps approaching his door.</span></p><div class="pagination">
