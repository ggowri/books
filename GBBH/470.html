  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alex, you better take good care of my daughter. One day, this whole jewelry business is going to be passed down to you two."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lynn was beaming&mdash;finding love and making up with her daughter had her in the best mood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander quickly assured her, "Don't worry, Ms. Blackburn. Ava's amazing, there's no way I'd ever treat her badly."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava blushed, leaning against Alexander's shoulder with a happy smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Alexander noticed that since Lynn mentioned passing down the jewelry business, the face of Victor Hughe, Lynn's </span><span>fiance</span><span>, had turned sour.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hughes, where do you work?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander asked politely, keeping his smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Victor could respond, Lynn jumped in, "Victor here is a top pharmaceutical researcher. You know that hot new product, 'The Magic Powder'? Well, his company is behind it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander exchanged a quick look with Ava, both of their expressions shifting to amused disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Victor puffed out his chest, clearly proud, his gaze drifting disrespectfully over Ava's neckline.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Developing the Magic Powder was just one of our little projects. I like to keep a low profile, but my company has quite a few other bestsellers. I won't bore you with the details."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava frowned, folding her arms across her chest, her stare turning cold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This Victor Hughes was just a liar, full of himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was ready to call Victor out right there, but Alexander gently placed a hand on her thigh, shaking his head slightly with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After dinner, Victor wasted no time asking Lynn out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lynn, I've been caught up with work lately, but I want to make it up to you. How about a movie tonight?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone knew what he really meant. Lynn blushed, playfully pinching his arm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Really? Saying that in front of the kids? You're impossible!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Victor chuckled, his gaze lingering on the curves of Lynn's breasts, his intentions far from subtle as his pants had already arched an incline.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander gave Ava a quick signal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava immediately wrapped her arms around Lynn, putting on her best puppy-dog eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom, I just got back. You wouldn't leave me alone, would you? We could have a girls' night in. You'll have plenty of time with Mr. Hughes later."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lynn could only smile, patting Victor's arm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How about tomorrow? I'll call you then."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Victor's face twisted with frustration, but he swallowed his annoyance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander clapped him on the shoulder, his tone casual but with a clear undertone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hughes, Lynn is my girlfriend's mother. I'm not letting anyone take advantage of her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hughes looked like a cat whose tail had been stepped on, nearly jumping out of his seat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's that supposed to mean? You better explain yourself!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander just laughed it off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You heard me. Anyway, I'll take them home now&mdash;no need to thank me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lynn gave Victor an apologetic smile as Ava tugged her toward the car, the three of them driving away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Victor stood there, grinding his teeth, furious that what he thought was a done deal was slipping away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>.....</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alex, what did you mean by that? Are you saying Mr. Hughes' a conman?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as they got home, Lynn's frustration boiled over. She was still upset at how Alexander had confronted Hughes during the drive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava quickly intervened, "Mom, Victor Hughes really is a fraud! The Magic Powder? That was Alexander's invention! And did you know, I'm the CEO of the Saint Group now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?! What did you just say?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lynn stared at her daughter, stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No way! That can't be true... You just don't want me to be happy with him! This is too much!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her face was flushed with anger, clearly not believing any of it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava was desperate, "Mom, please, keep your voice down. We're just trying to protect you..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander opened his mouth to speak, but Lynn waved him off, dismissing him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't want to hear it! Not from you! I need some time to think."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Blackburn, listen, Hughes doesn't love you. He's after your money. Once he's squeezed everything out of you, he'll toss you aside. You'll end up with nothing, and it'll be too late to regret it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander tried one last time, his voice calm but firm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Smack!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lynn slapped Alexander hard, tears welling up as she stormed out of the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander rubbed his stinging cheek, letting out a bitter chuckle. He knew that when a woman was caught up in the whirlpool of love, reason often went out the window.</span></p><div class="pagination">
