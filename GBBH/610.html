  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Felix, you ungrateful bastard! You deserve to rot in hell! I regret everything... I regret teaming up with you... I regret crossing paths with a monster like Alexander... Felix, I swear, even in hell, I won't let you off the hook!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Frederick's eyes blazed with fury as he hissed through gritted teeth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix merely shrugged off the outburst with a mocking smile as he looked down at Frederick with a gaze filled with greed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Frederick's body was paralyzed, an overwhelming fatigue washing over him like a tidal wave. It felt as if a gaping black hole was voraciously consuming him from the inside out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anger and despair surged through him, but he could barely keep his eyes open as the void of death relentlessly devoured everything he was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix's grin widened as he watched Frederick's body disintegrate, the remnants condensing into a few drops of crimson nutrient liquid that glimmered on the ground like red pearls.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The surface of the liquid formed a tough membrane, preventing it from seeping into the earth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ha!" Felix exhaled in excitement, carefully scooping up the precious drops of nutrient liquid before making his escape from the fiery chaos.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After leaving the Morris Estate, Felix didn't dare to wander too far. The last thing he wanted was to run into Alexander; that would be a death sentence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He quickly found a dense thicket and slipped inside, clutching the nutrient liquid tightly as he swallowed it down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moments later, a surge of powerful energy erupted within him. Before he could process what was happening, darkness enveloped him, and he collapsed into unconsciousness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the thicket, silence reigned except for Felix, who lay unconscious, his body radiating a faint red glow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The light intensified, pulsing brighter and brighter until he began to convulse as if struck by a seizure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, the aura he emitted grew stronger with each passing moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At Loscity Airport, Alexander strode out confidently, his daughter cradled in his arms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosalia and several of his men followed closely behind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Three sleek black Mercedes were parked nearby, waiting to whisk them away. For safety's sake, Alexander had opted not to let Ava and the others come to greet him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosalia tugged at Alexander's shirt, leaning over and whispering, "Master, can I watch when you get cozy with Ms. Blackburn tonight?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander chuckled, unable to suppress a grin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you a peeping Tom now? What's so interesting? If you want in, just join us! But be warned, Ava's a bit shy. You'll have to wait until I get things rolling; otherwise, she'll put her foot down."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hehe, you're the best, Master!" Rosalia giggled, playfully pinching Alexander's backside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, Ashley, her expression serious, piped up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My dad likes Ava, and you liking him won't change that!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both Alexander and Rosalia burst into laughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosalia affectionately ruffled Ashley's hair. "What a little sweetheart you are!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, a woman's terrified scream pierced the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They turned to see several burly men dragging a young girl toward the dark corner of the parking lot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Olivia, where do you think you're running off to? Hand over the gems, or you'll regret it!" one of the thugs barked, intimidating the girl, who was cornered and trembling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander handed Ashley over to Rosalia, instructing them to move ahead before striding toward the distressed woman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The girl couldn't have been more than twenty&mdash;innocent and beautiful, with wide, tear-filled eyes that stirred something deep within him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her slender figure was devoid of excess fat, yet she boasted a pair of ample breasts that quivered with every breath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey there, what's going on?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's voice was calm and soothing, prompting the girl to look up at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a rush of emotion, she dashed toward him, wrapping her arms around him tightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Please, you have to help me! They're trying to steal my gems!" she sobbed, her voice breaking into desperate cries.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander steadied her, feeling the warmth of her body against him, and couldn't help </span><span>but feel a rush of attraction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thugs had now surrounded them, glaring menacingly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Listen, buddy, this isn't your business. Just back off and leave the girl!" the leader, a scar-faced brute, barked at Alexander with a sneer.</span></p><div class="pagination">
