  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Two priestly soldiers stepped forward, helped Sellers up, and took him to the back hall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, the middle-aged priest shouted, "Sellers Schneier, you've passed!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sellers is the heir of the Schneier family, and I heard that he is already at the peak of a level-two warrior, yet he is seriously injured! I am afraid that we..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, the Schneier Spear Technique is unpredictable and unmatched. They command the world's respect!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Sellers in such a miserable state, everyone seemed to have taken a step back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Next!" the middle-aged priest shouted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Me!" A young man in green clothes entered the vermilion doorway.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the Dominion Church Outer Court, a servant walked straight to Fermin and whispered, "Congratulations, Mr. Schneier. Mr. Sellers Schneier has passed the assessment."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Good!" Fermin stroked his beard and smiled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Next! Alexander Hawthorne." A priestly soldier held the registration book and called the name.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander hurriedly entered the vermilion doorway.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The same green corridor, brightly lit lights, and Thunderclap Bronze Man. Its fierce and violent vibe rushed towards Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander twitched his eyebrows. He was calm. He urged the date-shaped Force vortex in his martial core, and strands of spiral Force roamed around.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His muscles rippled, rising like mountain ridges. It was as unyielding as iron yet soft as cotton when relaxed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Alexander truly mastered the level-two warrior stage, his muscles wouldn't just soften like cotton. They would flow like water.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander lunged toward the Bronze Man's flank.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Thunderclap Bronze Man roared and rose up. It flickered and slammed its giant golden fist straight at Alexander's head with the sound of thunder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Bronze Man was so fast that it was too late to dodge. Alexander could only muster the Force of his whole body to meet the blow head-on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bang!" Like a hammer hitting a nail, Alexander, the nail, flew out more than 30 feet. While still in the air, he felt his ribs tighten before a mouthful of blood burst from his lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Thunderclap Bronze Man didn't chase after Alexander but stood in place. Its pair of eyes were inlaid with black crystals. It stared at Alexander, and a hint of mockery seemed to flash across its eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Frustration welled up inside Alexander. As expected, the Bronze Man was as powerful as a level-three warrior. If not for his rapid progress over the past two months, he might have ended up knocked out cold on the spot like last time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, Alexander had no way out. If he remained stuck just half a step away from a level-two warrior, there was no chance he could pass the trial. He didn't know what to do.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's wrong? Are you afraid? Do you think martial arts is just about learning a few fancy moves? That it's a path to wealth and glory? A shortcut to power and prestige? No! True martial arts exist to protect the nation and to vanquish all evil!" The words of the middle-aged priest echoed in Alexander's mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"True martial arts are about cutting down evils, carving a path through thorns, and enduring countless hardships. Only then can you truly rise above!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before participating in the assessment, Alexander merely wanted to live well in this world, to find out whether the experience of another world in his mind was true or a dream.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Alexander was deeply touched after listening to the middle-aged priest's words. He no longer wanted to live an ordinary, timid life. He thought, "I can also live a vigorous life, leaving a glorious name for eternity. This Thunderclap Bronze Man can't stop me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A surge of excitement rushed through Alexander as sudden clarity washed over him. "Water is colorless and formless. In a square, it takes the shape of a square. In a circle, it flows as a circle. It moves without resistance..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He took on the stance of Harmonic Fist and performed its 24-posture sequence. The universe was always in motion. Balance came from opposing forces, sky and land, firm and yielding, solid and void.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, Alexander performed the Vardaanian yoga that included serpent pose, twisting pose, wide-angle pose, and shoulder stand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gradually, Alexander felt his entire body soften as if his bones had vanished. He became as light as cotton, as fine as a strand of hair, as fluid as water.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander clenched his fists, laughed heartily, and finally entered the level of a level-two warrior.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A level-two warrior mastered both hardness and softness. They could move swiftly and leap nimbly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fifteen minutes had passed. There was no time to waste.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander took off his coarse linen clothes, baring his upper body. He urged the Force vortex, and the spiral Force filled his body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The muscles of his body no longer bulged but were as usual. Under the flattened muscles, there was endless power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander gave a soft shout, exerted force under his feet, and stepped down continuously with three consecutive "Bang" sounds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was like a shooting star, flying towards the Thunderclap Bronze Man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Bronze Man seemed stunned, as if it didn't expect Alexander to suddenly become so fast and agile, unable to grasp the trajectory of his running.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And now, Alexander was about to slip past it.</span></p><div class="pagination">
