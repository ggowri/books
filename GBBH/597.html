  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, the Morris house was decorated with lights and was in a festive mood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It turned out that the Morris family was going to hold an event today. The head of the family, Frederick, was going to marry his niece, Megan Morris, to Felix and hold a grand wedding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Many figures of the Morris family prepared gifts and rushed back from other places.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Megan was young and beautiful. And she was Frederick's niece, which made many members of the Morris family feel that a little resentful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, the Red Umbrella Group was now facing difficulties, and Felix was being hunted by Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How could a man who couldn't even protect himself be qualified to marry a woman from the Morris family?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But this was not initiated by Felix himself, but was designated by Frederick, so no one dared to object.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Of course, Felix would not object. He just sneered, knowing Frederick's intentions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Frederick assigned a woman from the Morris family to follow Felix. And she must have been keeping an eye on Felix around the clock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix had to rely on the Morris family to deal with Alexander and wanted to refine Frederick into nutrient solution, so he continued to endure the humiliation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Frederick sat in the magnificent study, wiping his sword.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His bright eyes revealed excitement and anticipation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As long as the Morris family could get all the shares of Red Umbrella Group, they would be able to move to the next level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If they could catch Alexander and learn the secret, the Morris family would probably become the most powerful family in the country.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And Frederick would be the most outstanding figure in the history of the Morris family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Frederick wouldn't give Felix a chance to rebel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As long as Felix married Megan, Megan would be the heir to all his property!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Frederick sneered sinisterly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sword in his hand emitted a dazzling light. It was obvious that he was much stronger than Diego.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Frederick didn't take the so-called metahumans seriously. Martial arts </span><span>was</span><span> about </span><span>constantly breaking through one's own limits to become a truly strong person.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Frederick's strength was beyond that of Barry and Diego.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix and Alexander were nothing to Frederick.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, Felix was preparing the groom's attire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew that Frederick wanted to use him to get the shares of the Red Umbrella Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Felix was very good at intriguing and scheming.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix was playing with a syringe. The extract inside was flowing, emitting a strange red light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He estimated that Frederick's strength should not be weaker than that of a level-four metahuman. As long as he could turn Frederick into a nutrient potion and absorb it, he would have fourth-level superpowers, and his strength would improve by leaps and bounds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By then, he would control the Morris family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix had ambitions. He wanted to become the next Godfather and more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Getting more power and money was his lifelong pursuit!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew that his current strength was no match for Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if he became a level-three metahuman, he was still far behind Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were people in the military who supported Alexander, so Felix could not expect unconditional help from the military and could only rely on himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix believed that only by controlling the Morris family and making proper plans would there be a chance to inflict losses on both Frederick and Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then he would have the opportunity to turn one of them into a nutrient potion, greatly improve his strength, and then kill the other one.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought that his plan was perfect. Felix's eyes flashed with fanaticism!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this time, the door was pushed open. And a young and beautiful woman walked in, looking charming.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Megan looked at Felix with a smile. Ever since Frederick asked her to marry Felix, her status in the Morris family had improved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Therefore, Megan did not feel frustrated or opposed at all. She was even secretly excited.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She knew very well that in her family, she had no right to choose her husband and must contribute to the family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix was very young and good-looking. It was better for her than marrying old men.</span></p><div class="pagination">
