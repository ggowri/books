  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Alexander stepped out of the shower, he froze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosalia was lying back on the sofa in a new set of lingerie. The delicate bra barely covered her, and he could just make out the soft pink surrounding her peaks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her tiny navel, slim waist, and lace thong traced her curves while her long, smooth legs were crossed gracefully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosalia gave Alexander a sultry smile, beckoning him over with a finger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've been waiting for you, Boss... Come here to see if you smell as good as you look!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander couldn't help but swallow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Rebecca, where did you learn this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He walked to the sofa, looking down at her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hee-hee, do you like my little tricks?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosalia reached out, eyes gleaming with anticipation, as her hand brushed over his desire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Didn't Betty take good care of you just now? You're already reacting so strongly..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosalia looked quite pleased with Alexander's reaction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander inwardly chuckled; he wasn't any ordinary man. With the Force, he only grew stronger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Look, Boss, don't you think it looks even pinker than before? Maybe it's because you tasted it last time..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosalia released her soft curves, presenting them to Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's desire flared; he took each one in his hands and began to massage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah! Take it easy..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosalia melted against Alexander, going limp.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander used his Force, gently kneading her...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosalia was left completely relaxed, breathing heavily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Rebecca, this outfit is pretty sexy. Where did you buy it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry about that, Boss, just come here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosalia pulled Alexander down on top of her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander couldn't hold back any longer. After another hour-long session, he lay back on the sofa, content.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosalia looked completely satisfied, her gaze distant as if she hadn't come back to reality yet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander chuckled, feeling victorious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For a man, there were few greater satisfactions than power, money, and women.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What's more, Alexander felt his depleted Force not only fully restored but enhanced, having absorbed more of James' Force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander quickly got up, went to the desk, picked up his carving knife, and continued engraving </span><span>Spellweave</span><span> Patterns.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stroke after stroke, he worked continuously, his speed increasing as he went.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosalia watched in awe; though a skilled blade user herself, she sensed the terrifying power in Alexander's knife.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With her current skill, she doubted she could even block a single one of his strikes!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Alexander so engrossed in his work, Rosalia didn't dare ask or make a sound to interrupt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She carefully got dressed, tiptoeing out of the study.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only after closing the study door did Rosalia let out a deep breath; the pressure Alexander had given her was overwhelming.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though Alexander was only carving gems, the simplicity and precision of his blade strokes left her deeply intimidated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"One hundred and one!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"One hundred and two!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"One hundred and three, four, five..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, Alexander was only three strokes away from completing the one-hundred-and-eighth </span><span>Spellweave</span><span> Pattern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander let out a long breath. It seemed that each stroke became harder to finish.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The gemstones he had carved couldn't go to waste; each held dozens, even hundreds of </span><span>Spellweave</span><span> Patterns, making them excellent charms against sorcery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Selecting a few good gems with seventy or eighty </span><span>Spellweaves</span><span> each, Alexander strung them with red thread, intending to send them to Quentin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Selling these charms to Quentin could have made him a fortune, but given his relationship with Brittany, he had to gift them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a short rest, Alexander returned to the bedroom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava was sound asleep, her lips curved in a gentle smile. She must have been having a pleasant dream.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander gently pulled her into his arms and soon drifted off to sleep.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Early the next morning, the two of them arrived at the hospital, excited to pick up Ashley for her discharge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava wore a white V-neck T-shirt with capri-length skinny jeans, showing off her stunning figure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With her oval face, delicate features, and long hair cascading like a waterfall, she looked absolutely captivating.</span></p><div class="pagination">
