  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jackson felt a cold sweat break out on his forehead as panic set in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He mused, "What the hell! I had no idea Alexander was tight with Oscar. I should've bolted after getting 40 million!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Andrew jumped in quickly, saying, "Sir Stewart, this is Mr. Gellar, the genius behind the magic powder. He's a VIP at Orion."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Oscar paused, his eyes lighting up with excitement. He had been eager to become a distributor for the magic powder, and the potential profits were mouth-watering.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander leaned closer to Oscar, lowering his voice. "He's a fraud. I know the real developer of the magic powder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let him brag for now. To bring him down, we first have to let him think he's winning."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Oscar shuddered slightly, his expression shifting as he processed Alexander's words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You really know the actual developer?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander said, "Don't worry. Tomorrow, the Kaylon will definitely be one of the distributors. When have I ever lied to you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He clapped Oscar on the shoulder, a grin spreading across his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Oscar's excitement bubbled over. After spending time with Alexander, he had come to trust him implicitly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clearing his throat to regain his composure, Oscar said, "So, you're Mr. Gellar, the mastermind behind the magic powder. It's an honor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Since Alexander is my buddy, let's just let this incident slide."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jackson and the Fairfax family were left speechless, unable to muster a response. Alexander took Felicity by the hand and headed for the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as they were about to leave, Felicity turned back and shouted, "You guys can't push me around anymore! Alexander will protect me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, she clung tightly to Alexander's arm, causing him to blush a deep shade of red.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The room fell into a stunned silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone watched, wide-eyed, as Alexander and Felicity walked out, with Oscar following behind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They didn't have the courage to voice any objections.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once the door slammed shut, Jackson slammed his hand down on the table in frustration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ugh! You Fairfax family is out of line. We had a deal for Felicity to be mine, and now she's gone. How are you going to make this right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm sorry, truly sorry! It was our mistake. Please forgive us, Mr. Gellar," Jane stammered, her voice trembling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Andrew's face turned a deep shade of crimson, his teeth clenched in anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Gellar, you can't let that punk Alexander ruin Felicity's life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There are plenty of powerful families at tomorrow's conference. With just one word from you, you can have Alexander dealt with."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jackson rolled his eyes, dismissing the idea with a scoff.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You lot are useless. But fine, since I've already taken your 40 million </span><span>deposit</span><span>, I'll still make sure the distribution rights go to the Brilliant Group."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he turned on his heel and walked away, leaving Andrew and the others too intimidated to stop him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They followed him out, heads bowed in submission.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once they had seen Jackson off respectfully, Jane waved the agreement in the air, excitement lighting up her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm going to tell Mr. Sebastian Tate and Mr. Tate right now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thought of becoming the vice president of the Brilliant Group sent her heart racing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, back in Astral Bistro, Oscar shot Alexander a knowing smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You know, I just checked the surveillance footage from the private room. Jackson swindled the Fairfax family out of 40 million, which is practically ninety percent of their wealth! But how can you be sure he's really a fraud? Don't tell me you're the real developer, huh?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander burst into laughter, impressed that Oscar had picked up on the subtleties.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't confirm or deny anything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let the Fairfax family learn a lesson; I'm curious to see their faces when they realize they've been played."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A sense of anticipation filled Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had no intention of directly going after the Fairfax family, but their misfortune brought him a strange sense of satisfaction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, Alexander wasn't a saint, and the humiliation he had endured for five years was still fresh in his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Oscar grinned. "So, tomorrow, the Kaylon really will be one of the distributors?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander nodded confidently. "I've already made a bet with Orion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Saint Group will be the main distributor for the magic powder, and the Kaylon will be the state distributor, followed by county and city-level distributors."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Oscar's confidence soared. He quickly pulled out a check and handed it to Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Here's 50 million dollars for the state distribution deposit."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander chuckled, shaking his head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sir Stewart, just have that ready for the Saint Group when the time comes. No need to test me. Everything will become clear at the conference tomorrow!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
