  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Norah</span><span>, William, and Logan had one crucial task: prevent the monstrous beasts from climbing over the city walls.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They unleashed their powers repeatedly, but the intense strain began to wear them down, fatigue washing over them like a tidal wave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, others in the ranks, driven mad by the struggle, unleashed a relentless barrage on the approaching horde.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the beasts so near, they didn't need to aim, simply firing off entire magazines into the throng.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The job of reloading, however, fell to the young and old alike.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Crates of ammunition lay scattered on the ground, a shimmering sea of brass and copper. Individuals hurriedly surrounded the piles, their fingers moving deftly as they filled magazine after magazine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every loaded round was a glimmer of hope, a spark of victory in their desperate battle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Silence reigned as they all focused intently, every effort aimed at boosting their odds against the marauding beasts. Once reloaded, the magazines were handed off to those </span><span>ready at the frontline.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Over a thousand souls worked tirelessly to fend off the onslaught.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Phosphorus grenades and incendiary rounds erupted like fireworks, bright bursts illuminating the night. The brilliant white phosphorous rained down among the dense beast horde, creating chaos and destruction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Any monster unlucky enough to get caught in the splatter suffered horrifically, their thick hides no match for the burning chemical.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Countless creatures ignited, transforming them into rolling fireballs within the fray</span><span> </span><span>and</span><span>crashing</span><span> into one another with terrifying ferocity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If only Alexander and his group had the backing of a solid army or some aerial support, they could have turned the tide or even wiped out the pack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, they had hit the limit of their firepower, and reinforcements were nowhere in sight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beasts began to leap over the walls, only to be shot down, yet their relentless assault also claimed many defenders.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The roars of the wild creatures mingled with the pained cries of the humans, gunfire echoing chaotically in the night.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the midst of this turmoil, Alexander had slipped away, disappearing into the shadows.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ha! Fiona, I've taken out a bunch of monsters! I'm even!" Oswald </span><span>exclaimed,</span><span> his face smeared with blood as he brandished his assault rifle triumphantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Excitement crackled in his voice, marked by an unmistakable thrill.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fiona suddenly targeted him, unleashing a fierce barrage that left Oswald stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A mutated wolf had just vaulted onto the wall, but before it could land, Fiona's gunfire sent it crashing back down, blood spraying in a vivid arc.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fiona yelled, fury etched across her features, "What the hell is wrong with you? Are you completely out of your mind? You know it's dangerous up here! If you pull another stunt like that, I won't be able to save you!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you bite the dust, does that mean I'll have to marry a ghost?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Oswald's face turned ghostly pale, his lips trembling as he swallowed any words of protest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If not for her quick reflexes, he might have lost his head to that wolf.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Alexander donned a sleek black trench coat, sliding into the shadows like a specter of the night, moving deliberately to the less crowded areas of the beast horde.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His mission was clear: penetrate the heart of the chaos and eliminate the figure draped in the ominous cloak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even the aggressive, commanding red-haired gorilla that served as the beasts' general wouldn't escape his blade.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the night cloaking his movements, Alexander vanished into the beast tide, a silent assassin. His Lightsaber flicked through the air, taking down one mutated beast after another, their bodies collapsing into pools of blood on the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was as if he wielded an entire army himself, a whirlwind of death that felled anything in his path.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Any beast that dared to cross his way met a swift end at the glimmering edge of his saber, and he melded back into the darkness, using the chaos to his advantage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The horrifying spectacle sent chills racing down Augusta and the others' spines, their entire hope hanging on Alexander's shoulders.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The seemingly endless wave of beasts surged forth, accompanied by a swarming legion of mutated ants threatening the port.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And there was Alexander, a knife piercing through layers of cake, resolutely forging ahead into the heart of enemy territory.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, the ground began to tremble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Norah's face paled as she quickly scanned the area, trying to figure out what was happening. The earth shook more violently, the tremors growing in intensity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The containers started to sway, and people could see mounds rising from the ground, threatening to break through.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn! There's something underground!" Augusta </span><span>exclaimed,</span><span> face drained of color.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Augusta could see a long ridge of earth moving toward them, causing the makeshift wall to shake violently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Watch out! Something's coming from underground... Everyone, fall back! Fall back!" Norah shouted at the top of her lungs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Panic spread across the wall as everyone grabbed their weapons and ran.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Oswald and Fiona were also thrown into chaos, their feet stumbling as they tried to make their way down in the midst of the intense shaking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The ground shook with increasing force, as if an earthquake had struck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By the time they reached the ground, they were unable to stand steady, swaying from side to side.</span></p><div class="pagination">
