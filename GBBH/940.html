If anyone saw her messing around with a guy in a women's restroom, she'd be mortified.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Cloe knew men liked a bit of danger, so she was willing to take the risk, wanting to make this moment unforgettable for Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once the door was shut, the tight space actually made Cloe feel a bit more at ease.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Alexander looking a bit tense, she couldn't help but giggle, her eyes full of heat and mischief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sir, are you scared someone might catch us?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cloe asked in a teasing whisper.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The place was so quiet that even her soft voice seemed to echo off the stall walls.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander couldn't hold back anymore. He grabbed Cloe, pulling her close, his hands roaming over her hips and thighs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cloe's response was even more intense than he'd expected. She clung to his neck, kissing his face and neck hungrily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her intensity made Alexander feel like she wanted to devour him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her lips, red and full, along with her soft, agile tongue, kept teasing Alexander, kissing and nibbling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander couldn't help but chuckle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're getting my face all wet&mdash;you're like a little puppy in heat."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He whispered it into her ear, and Cloe shivered, her body responding instantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm your little puppy, sir. Do whatever you want to me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cloe whispered back, pressing her body against his, moving with a seductive rhythm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sir, I've been holding back for so long... I know you've got plenty of women&mdash;like that City of Sorcery lady, Yvonne... but right now, you're all mine. I want to savor every second.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Go ahead, be rough with me. I'm... I'm your little puppy. How's that? Exciting?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cloe's voice quivered as she kept teasing Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not only was she getting Alexander all worked up, but she was getting herself riled up too. She'd given up any hint of dignity, showing her desires openly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her passion and the thrill of it all had Alexander's senses on high alert.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cloe's hands were already fumbling eagerly with Alexander's zipper.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Puppy, get on your knees and help me out."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander commanded, pushing his fingers deeply between her thighs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was already soaked, and his fingers came away slick with her arousal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, Daddy."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without a moment's hesitation, Cloe knelt before Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander thought he'd seen it all&mdash;he'd been with countless women and experienced all kinds of thrills.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But nothing compared to this. This was beyond his imagination.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was the real thrill&mdash;sneaking around in a public restroom, right under everyone's noses. Two high-profile figures on Treasure Island, secretly getting wild.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That constant risk of getting caught only added to the excitement, making Alexander feel more alive than ever.</span></p><div class="pagination">
