  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Led by Oscar, Alexander entered the small courtyard outside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He suddenly caught a whiff of something... a faint but distinct herbal scent that felt refreshing and invigorating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This must be a rare medicinal herb that's over a century old," Alexander thought to himself as he followed Oscar toward a luxury RV.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Approaching the vehicle, Alexander immediately spotted a pot of green herbs on the coffee table.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The plant had jade-like leaves and pristine white flowers, releasing an enchanting fragrance that seemed to pierce straight to the soul.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was the legendary "Heaven's Grass", a scarce medicinal plant from Native </span><span>Loscity</span><span> lore known for its remarkable detoxifying properties.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Several powerful presences, far more vital than ordinary people, had already locked onto Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Oscar quickly made introductions. "This is Mr. Hawthorne, who's here to treat Gideon."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The intense surveillance eased slightly but remained hidden in the shadows, keeping a constant watch on Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oscar!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A frail, white-haired man wearing a surgical mask slowly emerged from the car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Gideon, this is Mr. Hawthorne I told you about. Let's get you started with the treatment right away," Oscar said, hurriedly helping him into a chair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander observed Gideon Patterson's pale complexion and listless expression. He clearly wasn't well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hold up! We need to search him first!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Two burly men suddenly appeared, moving to pat Alexander down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You think you can take me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander let out an irritated scoff. Moving like lightning, he grabbed the man by the throat, lifted him clean off the ground, and slammed him down hard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before the other guy could even blink, Alexander had him by the neck, too, handling him as quickly as if he were a rag doll.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander had held back. They were just dazed and winded from the impact, seeing stars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Freeze!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Several burly men in black burst from the shadows, pulling guns on Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The tension in the air was thick enough to cut with a knife.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gideon immediately roared, "What the hell are you doing? Have you lost your mind? I told you I don't need protection! Mr. Hawthorne is Oscar's guest! Why would he try to hurt me?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Put those damn guns down and get the hell out of here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gideon chewed them out viciously, tearing into the reckless guards.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The security team stared at Alexander with a mix of fear and awe. "Damn, this kid was something else. One move and he'd taken out our captain."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were all ex-Special Forces, elite warriors who could each take on ten men.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their captain was practically a legend in military circles, yet this young man had laid him out with a single move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, Mr. Patterson!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The guards picked up their fallen comrades and backed away, shooting bitter glares at Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander couldn't be bothered with the guards. His piercing eyes scanned Gideon thoroughly, and through his All-seeing Eyes, he already knew what was going on, though he needed to confirm the details.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said coolly, "You're infected with the plague. It started showing symptoms the day before yesterday morning, correct?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those simple words immediately got Gideon excited.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hadn't even described his symptoms yet this man had figured everything out just by looking at him. It was incredible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne, I'm so sorry about earlier. My guards are just being cautious. The Sakra Society from </span><span>Risun</span><span> has been trying to kidnap me, so they're on edge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah, </span><span>Risun</span><span> wanted me to research for them, but I refused. No matter how much money they offered...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Those bastards, when they saw money wouldn't work, they tried to either kidnap me or kill me. This infection might even be their doing, setting me up behind the scenes."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gideon broke into violent coughs as if his lungs were trying to escape his body. A thin line of blood trickled from the corner of his mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Take it easy. Let me examine you carefully."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander stepped forward, using the Force to sense while scanning Gideon's body with his mystical vision.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a moment, Alexander's brows furrowed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's poison!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Could the City of Sorcery be behind this plague?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The poison was incredibly potent. With current medical technology, there was no quick cure - it was terminal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But for Alexander, who possessed the Ultimate Legacy, this wasn't a complex problem.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, this poison came from the wizard, who the Warrior had killed.</span></p><div class="pagination">
