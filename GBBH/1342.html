  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inside the Hall of Supremacy at Darwin Palace, a loud "clang" echoed as a priceless white jade cup shattered into fragments.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinton, fuming with rage, furrowed his brows and glared fiercely. "Someone, throw Lana into the dungeon!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Two guards clad in helmets and armor swiftly dragged a pale-faced Lana away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Taking a deep breath, Quinton sighed and ordered, "Ask Jeffrey to come."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>An older guard rose, respectfully backing out of the palace before heading to the court.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The layout of Darwin Court was immaculate, featuring towering red walls and grand pavilions with ornate ridges and eaves, an impressive sight to behold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Above the gate hung two large golden characters spelling out "Darwin Court," inscribed by King Darius himself, exuding a sense of majesty and authority.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In front of the court gate stood a formidable drum for complaints, flanked by two stone archways. The east archway bore the word "Obedience," while the west archway read "Civilization."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Obedience" signified adherence to the government's will, and "Civilization" reflected the promotion of cultured behavior.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As one entered the court, they were greeted by an imposing screen wall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adorned on the wall was a mythical creature with the head of an animal, a deer-like body, a single horn, and piercing eyes, radiating a fierce demeanor. Legend had it that it possessed the unique ability to discern right from wrong, good from evil, and loyalty from treachery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beyond the screen wall lay a spacious courtyard paved with bluestone slabs, dominated by a massive stone tablet bestowed by King Darius. On its southern face was etched the word "Integrity," a reminder to officials that only through fairness, honesty, and genuine service to the public could they gain true insight and make sound judgments.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the northern face, the words "For the People" served as a warning to officials to maintain their integrity and avoid exploiting the citizens for personal gain, lest they face penalties.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At one end of the courtyard stood the court hall, adorned with a vermilion plaque that proclaimed "Fair, Upright, Transparent" in bold characters that shone brightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The hall was illuminated, showcasing three imposing bronze guillotines shaped like a "dragon head," "tiger head," and "dog head," glinting coldly in the light, gifts from Quinton.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rows of formidable guards lined both sides, brandishing sticks and standing in perfect formation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seated in the hall was a man in a purple official uniform, a gold and jade belt cinched around his waist. He had a weathered face, a crescent moon mark on his forehead, eyes that glinted ominously, and a long beard flowing beneath his chin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was none other than Jeffrey Dewey, the Grand Secretary, renowned for his integrity and fairness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeffrey stroked his beard thoughtfully and spoke, "In recent months, dozens of young women have vanished in Darwin, and the true culprit remains elusive. With Princess Isolde now missing, His Majesty is furious. We have three days to uncover her whereabouts. Mr. Sutton, what are your thoughts?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Douglas replied, "Mr. Dewey, Ruben and the other three have been dispatched to track down leads. However, Darwin is vast, and it may be challenging to find her. Fortunately, Alexander is resourceful and has sent word. We can deploy Zain for assistance."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeffrey nodded, "The Risunese cult is skilled in martial arts and has always behaved suspiciously. We need to maintain a loose exterior while tightening our internal security to prevent panic among the people of Darwin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Sutton, please take additional guards and constables to the southwest to set up surveillance at the post stations. Zain, hurry and aid Alexander, ensuring Princess Isolde's safe rescue."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zain Dunne, stationed on the right, bowed and acknowledged, "Yes, Mr. Dewey."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In his thirties, Zain wore a short red warrior's uniform, exuding a gallant demeanor. Handsome and confident, he wielded a steel sword, embodying the spirit of a true hero.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By now, the night had deepened. Four Risunese carriages moved in a line, with Alexander trailing behind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the last carriage, Arturo scoffed, his voice gravelly. "That young man has been following us for over three miles. Walgus Hill lies ahead; we can set a trap for him there and eliminate him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Reece leaned in, whispering, "Your Snake Hand is the finest skill in the world. Leave it to me, Mr. Burkart; you can rest assured."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beside them, a woman with a graceful figure was bound and gagged with a cloth, struggling in vain. It was Isolde.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Walgus Hill loomed large ahead, its slopes lined with towering pine trees, their dense canopies releasing a fragrant pine aroma.</span></p><div class="pagination">
