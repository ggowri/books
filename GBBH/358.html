  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander put on the face mask of the last time and took on the appearance of Edison.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Guards at the dock blocked Alexander's way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He asked with a smile, "Why, I've only been away for a while, and you don't recognize me anymore."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, it's you, Edison. I am sorry."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The captain of the guards slapped his forehead and waved his hands at his men.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Everyone, get out of the way! This is Edison, the director of the trading center, who </span><span>is also Ms. Cloe Bryant's boyfriend!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was stunned. When did he become Cloe's boyfriend?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The captain said with a smug grin, "Edison, please don't hide it from us. Didn't Ms. Cloe Bryant personally send you on board last time?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you are not her boyfriend, given her position, how could she have seen you off in person? Don't worry. We are very tight-lipped and won't tell others."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander instantly grasped the situation and became speechless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't explain, thinking it was good for these people to misunderstand his relationship with Cloe because he didn't want to reveal his true identity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander arrived at the Brilliant Group. Led by a female secretary, he reached Cloe's office unimpeded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Along the way, many employees stared at him strangely and gossiped about him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who is that guy? He has actually won the favor of Ms. Cloe Bryant. How lucky!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Cloe Bryant just regards him as a plaything for fun."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fuck! I wish I could attract Ms. Cloe Bryant someday. She is pretty and sexy. I'd be willing to live ten years less."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander ignored them and entered Cloe's office calmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A rich fragrance wafted to his face. It turned out that she was cooking in an apron.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The office was actually a huge suite.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It had everything necessary, including a luxurious living room, open kitchen, office, bedroom, and bathroom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cloe was making clam chowder. It had been simmering in the pot for a long time and was about to be served. No wonder it smelt so good.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander took a deep breath and chuckled, "To my surprise, you, president of the Brilliant Group and head of the Bryant family, are good at cooking!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cloe smiled sweetly, "Boss, are you mocking me? I put a lot of effort into preparing this meal today."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I said the wrong thing."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander laughed. He was very smart and would never argue with women, especially beautiful ones.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He sat on the sofa and quietly watched Cloe busy around.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was dressed in a very tight yoga suit under her apron. Her figure was curvy and voluptuous, and now, the suit accentuated her shape even more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The open neckline revealed her amazingly plump breasts. There was only a thin layer of black gauze covering her slender waist. Her buttocks were round and full, and her legs were long. She was extremely seductive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Any man would be seduced by her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cloe felt Alexander's burning gaze sweep over her, and her heart suddenly skipped a beat. She felt very hot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had an ulterior motive for preparing lunch here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For a man as powerful as Alexander, she was willing to flatter him, even to deliberately please him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He waited for a while, and Cloe came to the table with several dishes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were delicious and delicate, and there was still a bottle of vintage wine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It smells good. I am indeed hungry."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander took the initiative to eat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The clam chowder tasted great. It was creamy and slightly sweet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's yummy. You are a great cook!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander praised Cloe while eating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She ate with small bites and grinned. Seeing him enjoy the meal greatly, she felt a great sense of accomplishment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh no!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cloe's cell phone suddenly fell to the floor, and she bent down to retrieve it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As a result, her huge, plump breasts were fully displayed to Alexander through the open neckline.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't help but widen his eyes and get excited.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cloe's charming breasts swayed, and pink nipples became apparent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She blushed and deliberately dawdled for a while before slowly picking up the phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander knew that she deliberately exposed herself to seduce him.</span></p><div class="pagination">
