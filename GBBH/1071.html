  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander didn't mind her rage and leisurely sat on the sofa, putting his legs on the table to take a sip.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The reason he chased her here was to teach this woman a lesson and to figure out why those </span><span>guys went</span><span> after her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was sure that they were not from the Ultimate Alliance. That was why he felt more confused about why those men chased this woman in his name.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've brought you water, so leave my house! </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>I'm not your wife, and you took advantage of me just now, so we're even. Let me remind you again, leave my house after drinking the water, or I'll call the police!" Maxine put her hands on her hips and said aggressively.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander responded to her with a smile, "That's not what you said when you were in trouble just now. Now you want to dump me after </span><span>using me</span><span>? It's not that easy, </span><span>sweetie</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I mean, you can't make me take all the blame, right? So, I'm here to do some calculations. You promised to reward me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, hit me with some surprise."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he put down the water cup, he slowly spread his legs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxine instantly blushed when seeing his bulging crotch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought, "Jerk! His dick became hard right in front of me!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She shouted, "Bah!!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I have never said anything like that, you pervert! Get out! I... I don't even know you, so stop talking nonsense!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxine </span><span>broke her word</span><span>, and she rolled her eyes again like a cunning fox full of schemes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smiled and couldn't help licking his lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Somehow </span><span>he felt his body was brimmed with lust for sex. Ever since he became an Advanced Warrior, this kind of desire grew stronger and stronger to an irrepressible extent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander</span><span> </span><span>said, "You said you don't know me? Seems like you're really going to </span><span>kick me away</span><span> after using me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, let's get to know each other now. You have a really nice body and fair skin. It must be wonderful to have sex with you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he said that, he wore a lewd face on purpose and approached Maxine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had decided to threaten her </span><span>a bit. So she would </span><span>tell the hidden truth behind this mess.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing him </span><span>walking </span><span>towards her with that disgusting smile, Maxine was so frightened that she stepped back in a hurry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stay away from me! I'll call the police</span><span>!</span><span> I mean it! Get out of my house, pervert! Why... Why are you getting closer...</span><span>?</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had already retreated to the corner and completely panicked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, Alexander rubbed his hands with a wicked smile and acted like he was going to pounce </span><span>on</span><span> her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, she suddenly burst into tears and stumbled to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxine said, "I'm sorry, I'm so sorry. I really didn't know how to get rid of those guys just now, and no one dared to help me. Then, I came across you...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're so handsome and stood in the middle of the street, so I immediately discovered you. I really didn't mean to bother you..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxine explained to Alexander with pitiful tears and looked </span><span>like a poor kitty</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, enough! Stop acting like an innocent victim. I've seen countless schemers that were much more sophisticated than you. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Your tears didn't work for me. I can let you go if you tell me </span><span>why those guys went after</span><span> you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A hint of ruthlessness glinted in his deep eyes as he glared at Maxine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sudden menace aroused a chill and hit her spine with it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you a straight man? How can you still be so indifferent in the face of the tears from a sexy </span><span>beauty</span><span> like me?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since she failed to seduce Alexander, Maxine immediately wiped her tears and roared like a </span><span>male </span><span>tiger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander sneered and said, "Tell me, who are you</span><span>? W</span><span>ho</span><span>'s hunting you?</span><span> </span><span>A</span><span>nd why </span><span>are they going after you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You</span><span> won't </span><span>rape me, right? In that case, I can tell you, but you have to leave right after getting what you want!" Maxine pointed at the door in a rage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Responding with a snort, Alexander didn't make any comments on her request</span><span> </span><span>and returned to the sofa, crossing his legs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He found this woman actually quite interesting</span><span>, like a little cunning fox.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My name is Maxine Duncan. I'm not from Loscity, but Newbrook. Have you heard of Silver Shield Security?" Maxine said that with </span><span>serious look</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Silver Shield Security? Of course!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was stunned. Silver Shield Security specialized in security equipment and was equipped with a streamlined production based on their own innovation.</span></p><div class="pagination">
