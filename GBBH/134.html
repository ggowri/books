  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's wrong? Not happy to see me?" </span><span>Lara</span><span> slid closer to Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander felt her smooth, delicate leg press against him, her seductive scent filling the air, and was taken aback.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"People who act nice without reason are either scheming or thieves. What do you want, following me at this hour?" He asked coldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lara</span><span> looked at him with an innocent expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I admit I misjudged you before. Ava is smarter than me. What can I say? Are you really going to hold a grudge against me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander rolled his eyes. "Just say it. What do you want?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had thought </span><span>Lara</span><span> was just a simple-minded girl, but now he saw that women from wealthy families were far from naive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lara</span><span> hesitated, struggling to put aside her pride.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you won't say it, I'm leaving. I don't want Ava to get the wrong idea. Don't follow me again, or I won't be so nice." Alexander got up to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wait!" </span><span>Lara</span><span> quickly grabbed his arm. In her haste, her ample chest bounced, drawing looks from nearby men.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's gaze turned cold, even showing a hint of hostility.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lara</span><span> forced a bitter smile. "I really don't mean any harm. I just want to talk about a partnership. I've already apologized. Can you not treat me this way? There's no unresolved grudge between us."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A partnership?" Alexander pondered briefly and slowly sat back down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lara</span><span> breathed a sigh of relief, purposely patting her chest, causing a noticeable ripple.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Alexander's previous remark at the elevator about her not being well-endowed, she had intentionally worn a push-up bra today to create a fuller look.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Alexander didn't glance her way, showing no interest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What a strange man..." </span><span>Lara</span><span> was at a loss, realizing more than ever that Alexander was different from other men.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Impatient, Alexander said, "Stop beating around the bush. What's this partnership you want?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew it wasn't about the magic powder since the Hansen family already had a distribution deal with the Saint Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, </span><span>Lara</span><span> confessed her </span><span>problem</span><span> to Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Orion wants to steal your position as heir?" After listening, Alexander seemed to understand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Can you help me? I</span><span> will </span><span>do anything if you help..." </span><span>Lara</span><span>'s face flushed, looking at Alexander with hopeful eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anything?" Alexander pressed her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lara</span><span>'s face turned redder, as if she were about to bleed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, anything... even if you want me as your lover! I-I'm still a virgin..." She leaned against Alexander's shoulder, pressing her ample chest against his arm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was speechless. </span><span>Lara</span><span> had clearly misunderstood him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't help but get turned on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, I'll help you become the head of the Hansen family, but I want ten percent of the Hansen family's shares. Of course, I'll give the Hansen family the rights to distribute magic powder in three states."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?" </span><span>Lara</span><span>'s body jolted, glaring at Alexander in shock and anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Our family is worth fifty billion, and you're asking for ten percent! That's five billion. You'd be taking hundreds of millions in profits every year!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smirked. "You came to me for this partnership. You need my help. Plus, the distribution rights for three states could bring you profits of a billion annually. And most importantly, I can help you become the head of the Hansen family!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lara</span><span> was speechless. After a long silence, she bit her lip and finally agreed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, we'll sign an agreement. If you can help me become the head of the Hansen family in three years, and..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>T</span><span>hree years</span><span> are too long</span><span>. Six months will do." Alexander cut her off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Six months? Are you serious?" </span><span>Lara</span><span> wondered if Alexander was joking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander didn't answer, merely looking </span><span>Lara</span><span> over with a playful gaze.</span></p><div class="pagination">
