Today, my sales reached one million dollars, and I earned a bonus of 40 thousand dollars." a beautiful female shop assistant in a luxury store beamed with joy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Yeah, you're really lucky today. That customer is so rich. He bought Herm&egrave;s without batting an eye. The people on this island are wealthy," another hot female shop assistant said enviously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Heh, I told you to come here to make money, but you didn't want to. Now, you know I didn't lie to you, right? You can really make money here. It's not called Treasure Island for nothing," the beautiful shop assistant boasted about her foresight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"How was I supposed to know it would be like this? Before, people said Treasure Island was full of criminals who killed, raped, and robbed," the slender shop assistant said with embarrassment. "I didn't dare to come."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The beautiful shop assistant rolled her eyes. "Don't listen to those people's nonsense. Many people on Treasure Island indeed make money in shady ways, but there are rules here. As long as Brilliant Group keeps them in check, they won't dare to act recklessly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Remember the robber from the day before yesterday? He was shot dead on the street by the patrol team. Who would dare to rob now? So, this place is our paradise for making money," the beautiful shop assistant said excitedly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She leaned in closer and added, "Katy, I heard that a very rich man is pursuing you, right? He even bought you flowers."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Yeah, he seems pretty good, just a bit older than me. He's in the arms business. He said he's made enough money and wanted to settle down on Treasure Island." Katy blushed, slightly swaying her body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'm so jealous of you. What's there to be shy about? Marrying a man ten years older is fine. As long as he's mature and stable and has money, that's the most important thing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Being with a man like that, you'll be set for life," the beautiful shop said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She patted Katy on the shoulder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Yeah, let's work hard together and make a name for ourselves on Treasure Island." Katy felt a surge of energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The wall clock chimed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Katy glanced at the time, and a sweet smile appeared on her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She said, "There's still half an hour left. He'll come to pick me up to go shopping. Could you take care of the store for me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Beautiful scenes like this were common on Treasure Island.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The island was peaceful and safe, with a cool sea breeze blowing. People were filled with hope for a bright future.</span></p><div class="pagination">
