  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These monsters have completely lost it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone shared the same feeling. During the day, those creatures would shrink back at the sight of heavy gunfire, clearly afraid and ready to bolt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now? They were out for blood, driven by a frenzy that hinted at some dark secret lurking behind their madness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander remained calm and composed amidst the chaos, fully aware of how the situation was likely to unfold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had prepared for this moment. They were facing a choice: either let the beast tide wash over their defenses or plunge into the fray to uncover the hidden truth behind the shadowy figure orchestrating this attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In stark contrast, the thoughts of Karson and the others spiraled into despair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as their defenses crumbled, it would signal certain death for them all, with no chance of escape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, none of them considered fleeing. This war wasn't merely against monsters; it was a fight for survival against the beasts that threatened humanity's very existence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Surrendering their weapons wouldn't save them; the monsters would slaughter them without mercy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, each of them resolved that if death was inevitable, they would take as many of these beasts with them as they could.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Expressions of desperation mingled with a tragic determination filled the air, hinting at their shared resolve to fight until the bitter end.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing the fire in everyone's eyes, Alexander turned to Augusta and commanded, "I need you to form a group to keep watch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anyone who tries to flee... don't hesitate. Shoot to kill!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Augusta paused momentarily, then nodded with respect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He understood what Alexander meant. Even though everyone had committed to fight, facing the terror of impending death could provoke even the bravest into fleeing, shattering their defense line in the process.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And if that happened, even if Alexander managed to eliminate the enigmatic figure in the dark cloak, it wouldn't be enough to save them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I command you now, anyone who dares to run away&mdash;no matter who it is, you have my order to kill on sight!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's booming voice carried a weight that sent chills down everyone's spine, an unbearable pressure settling over them like a mountain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Augusta had already gathered twenty members of the Ultimate Alliance, positioned just behind the others, their fierce glares serving as a stern warning to anyone tempted to bolt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sight of the enforcement squad positioned behind them cemented their resolve. With no chance of escape, everyone steeled themselves for a brutal confrontation with the beast horde.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander nodded in satisfaction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Oswald and Fiona busily loaded ammunition into their weapons. Hours of practice had made them incredibly adept at the task.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each bullet slipped into the belt, feeding seamlessly into the machine gun, which unleashed a deadly barrage at the incoming mutated beasts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fiona, do you really think we're going to die?" Oswald asked, his gaze fixed on the encroaching horde.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite their relentless firepower, the beasts were still inching closer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fiona cast him a sharp glance, her hands moving even faster as she loaded the final </span><span>rounds into the belt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Oswald sighed dramatically, prompting Fiona to chime in with a sharp retort. "You were just acting all brave, and now that the monsters are getting closer, you're suddenly a scaredy-cat?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you even think about running away, I swear I'm coming for you first!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fiona fixed him with a fierce glare, worried that he might panic and cause chaos among their ranks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm not afraid of dying, just scared I won't get to marry you!" Oswald quickly defended himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Seriously? Is that all you can think about? Is it all about romance and wedding bells in your mind? If I bite the dust, good luck finding another woman!" Fiona's voice was laced with frustration as she reprimanded him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, I just like you. Only you. No other women," Oswald declared, his voice unwavering.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shut up! Spare me your smooth talk. If you even think about running today, don't bother showing up if we survive. I'm not marrying some coward," Fiona snapped, her fiery gaze making her look like a formidable tigress ready to pounce.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A monstrous roar cut Oswald off, silencing his reply instantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The beasts were close now, their hulking, mutated forms drawing nearer to the walls, bringing the terrifying reality of close-quarters combat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grenades exploded in rapid succession, sending flames and shockwaves rippling through the chaos.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each blast sent several mutated beasts hurtling through the air, their shredded bodies flung high before raining down in a macabre shower of blood and bone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The gunfire intensified, a cacophony of deafening reports. Sweat dripped from Norah's forehead, stinging her eyes, but she didn't dare spare a moment to wipe it away. She fired </span><span>relentlessly,</span><span> her weapon spitting bullets with machine-like precision.</span></p><div class="pagination">
