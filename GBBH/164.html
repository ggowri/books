It's impossible! Absolutely impossible!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Alexander was taken aback; he hadn't expected the woman to wake up so soon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Mary's excitement, he quickly urged, "Mary, your mother is still weak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She needs to rest, and too much excitement could hinder her recovery."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mary snapped back to reality, casting a grateful glance at Alexander.

I'm so sorry! Please </span><span>forgive my rudeness earlier</span><span>!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A witch doctor was also a wizard, but because they preferred using their magical abilities to heal, they were known as witch doctors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander could only </span><span>smile</span><span>, dismissing his flattery and opportunism.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mary shot Brad a fierce glare.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dr. Hank, my mom is awake now.

Alexander replied, genuinely confused.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mary's cheeks flushed with embarrassment. She playfully pinched him at the waist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't play coy with me! Do you think I'm going to throw myself at you? </span><span>Relax</span><span>, I'm not some </span><span>slutty </span><span>woman.
