"What research project?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Genetics... a genetics research project... ah!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Andrew could finish, Alexander kicked him hard in the stomach, causing him to curl up like a shrimp, convulsing on the floor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Where is Felix?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander pressed his foot against Andrew's chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Andrew's face turned pale as he stammered, "I don't know, I truly don't know! Alexander, you... you can't treat me like this... I was your father-in-law..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander delivered another kick to his gut.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ugh..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, Andrew felt the pain surge through him like bile rising from his stomach.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If it weren't for your blood relation to Ashley, you'd already be dead!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's deep eyes glimmered with menace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Andrew visibly relaxed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But while you can escape a death sentence, a living punishment is unavoidable.

"No! Please don't kill me! I'm begging you... think of Ashley..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosalia let out a tinkling laugh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Master said he won't kill you, so I won't. But to think you would kidnap your own granddaughter&mdash;you're even lower than an animal."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, the blade flashed twice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blood marks appeared on Andrew's wrists and ankles as the sharp edge bit into his flesh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't until the blood began to seep out that Andrew truly felt the excruciating pain and opened his mouth to wail.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosalia stuffed a filthy sock into his mouth to silence him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wah!
