  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yannick had a gloomy face. He knew he was no match for Alexander and did not dare to shout.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What he couldn't imagine was how Alexander had sneaked into here without triggering any alarms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No way!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Was there a traitor?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yannick saw Alexander untying Melin's rope and quietly took a step back. When he saw that Alexander didn't notice him, he was overjoyed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought he had a chance!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yannick immediately turned and ran towards the cell door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Alexander looked at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Where are you going?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander sneered and waved his hand. The hemp rope that had just been untied from Melin flew over and hit Yannick's back hard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yannick screamed and fell heavily to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The hemp rope actually pierced his body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yannick fell to the ground and began to twitch wildly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Melin and the others could come to their senses, Yannick, whom they hated so much, had been killed. It was unbelievable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well done!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melin cheered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is everyone okay?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander freed everyone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He just tore the tough hemp ropes apart and threw them on the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melin was so excited to regain her freedom that she threw herself into Alexander's arms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you, Mr. Hawthorne!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The police officers were also grateful to Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm glad you're all right."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was also a little scared. Fortunately, he arrived in time. Otherwise, Melin would be in danger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This female sheriff was very good to him. If she died here, it would be an irreparable loss.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if Yannick was killed, it would be of no use.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't be afraid. I will protect you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander patted Melin's back to comfort her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melin's eyes were filled with tears. She had just wanted to commit suicide, but was rescued in time by her lover. And Yannick was died.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This made her unable to calm down for a long time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We are not completely out of danger. First, tell me what you know. How much do you know about Base One?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melin wiped away her tears and said with a serious expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Two days ago, I found several men in black who were carrying out a kidnapping in the suburbs of </span><span>Loscity</span><span>. When we made our move, they caught us.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Those men in black are not human. They are not afraid of guns, extremely strong, and... They eat people!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melin thought of the horrific scene at that time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"After we were captured, Yannick transported us here..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A police officer nearby interrupted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne, pay special attention to those men in black with rotting bodies. They are invulnerable to swords and guns! Two of our colleagues were torn apart and eaten alive by them..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking of the horrific scene at that time, they were all terrified and broke out in cold sweats.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was a murderous intent flashing in his deep eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said, "I will make these beasts pay the price they deserve. I will kill them all and destroy Base One!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was confident he could handle the living dead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Should we call the police?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melin was worried. There were only six of them in total.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although everyone knew that Alexander was very powerful, they were still nervous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander waved his hand. "It's useless to call the police. It's too late. You just follow me and take care of yourselves. I'll do it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We can't let them spread this horrific thing. It will be a disaster for all of humanity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But I still need to find Hazel before I can destroy the base. Have you seen a young girl of about eighteen?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They shook their heads.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, Alexander saw the employee's card on Yannick's body and was surprised.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He picked up the card and inserted it directly into the instrument next to him. He then cut off Yannick's finger and pressed it on the instrument, successfully entering the base's system.</span></p><div class="pagination">
