  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Alexander told Xavier the news of investing in the Axe, Xavier was thrilled. "Alexander, thank you for your trust!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, the Axe accounted for more than half of the gem trading volume in Mandale Town, one of the world's largest gem trading hubs, with an astronomical daily trading volume.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander asked Xavier to be the representative to exercise his shares in the Axe, much to Xavier's excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the future, the status of the Ulysses family's Phoenix Gemstone Establishment in the global gem industry would surely rise to a higher level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the branch of the Mafia in Mandale Town, Paxton lay on the big bed, smoking leisurely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The bathroom door opened, and a beautiful woman in a sexy and thin bathrobe appeared in front of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paxton smiled obscenely and stared greedily at her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thin bathrobe could not cover her seductive body at all. Her looming voluptuous figure, coupled with her charming face, aroused him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Beverly, you are so stunning. You are worthy of being the most beautiful girl in Mandale Town. Even Alyssa from the Axe is far inferior to you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paxton couldn't help but rush forward to hold Beverly in his arms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was not shy at all and chuckled smugly, "Why are you so impatient? I've heard that men who are too impatient can't last long. If I don't have an orgasm later, you are not allowed to come so early..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paxton laughed and said, "Don't worry. I will definitely show you how virile I am and give you endless pleasure."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He kissed and caressed Beverly's body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She showed a provocative expression and snorted, "Men are all the same. You will come in three minutes."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paxton howled with anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I should teach you a lesson. How dare you look down upon me? Today, I'll show you whether it's three minutes or thirty minutes!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paxton held Beverly down on the bed, and they huddled tightly together.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her moans soon filled the room...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>More than ten minutes later, Paxton, who was sweating all over, left Beverly's body, sat limply on the bed, and lit a cigarette with leisure and satisfaction.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She also sat up, gazed at him with disdain, and said, "Hey, you came, but I haven't had an orgasm yet. As I said, you can only last a few minutes. It's really disappointing."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paxton grinned and did not object. After all, he was in the wrong. Men were naturally inferior to women in this aspect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Beverly, I invited you here mainly to discuss the Axe."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beverly immediately frowned with worry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Paxton, what is the trump card of the Axe Gang? Why did that bitch Alyssa swallow up two major forces overnight?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paxton embraced her again, caressing her plump breasts, and smiled, "Beverly, don't be anxious! No matter how powerful the Axe is, they can't beat the Mafia. Alyssa will definitely be doomed!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beverly married into the Weaver family, but after the family had passed away, everything was taken over by her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Therefore, she was the de facto controller of the Weaver family, a major force in Mandale Town.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beverly was willing to sleep with Paxton purely because she was scared by the Axe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They wiped out two major forces in one night. She had to team up with him, fearing that the Weaver family would be destroyed overnight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paxton was uneasy, too, so they colluded with each other and became sex partners.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He sneered indignantly, "Will the Mafia be afraid of the ordinary Axe? Don't worry. If they are really going too far, Godfather SATAN will be able to kill Alyssa in a backhanded move."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beverly sighed and asked, "Really? Don't be so arrogant. The Mafia is indeed powerful in Mandale Town and even in Goldford.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But you have limited manpower in Mandale Town, and there are not many experts. If the Axe really attacks us, we might be no match for them!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paxton chuckled, "In the past two days, your mine output and sales channels have been severely suppressed by the Axe. The losses must be considerable, right?"</span></p><div class="pagination">
