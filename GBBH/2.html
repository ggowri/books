  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander stood there like a deer in headlights, his brain short-circuiting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hold up - what Godfather? Go home where? What are you talking about?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, a beautiful woman walked toward him, her curvy body swaying with each step.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne," she purred respectfully, "the Godfather's waiting. You're one of three potential heirs. Please, come with me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His heart nearly jumped out of his chest. This was way too much, way too fast.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The guards who'd been roughing him up were instantly thrown against the wall by those black-suit men, collapsing unconscious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander froze in shock, too frightened to say anything. He quickly followed the beautiful woman onto the helicopter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then a phone's ring cut through the tension like a knife.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The woman handed the phone to him. Shaking, Alexander answered the call.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Welcome home, Alexander." The voice sounded ancient, powerful. "You'll be competing with your two brothers to become my successor. Only the winner inherits everything."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Listen, you're now chairman of the Saint Group. You need to double its value to 200 billion in twelve months. Oh, and stay alive."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you fail, you'll lose your inheritance... or worse, death!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Click. Dead air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's brain went into overdrive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">What does this mean? A competition?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">I'm now the chairman of the Saint Group - the company everyone kissed up to?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">And he wants me to double its value to 200 billion? In a year? Hey, how is that even possible?!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Wait, did he say I have two brothers?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Death... So my brothers will try to kill me?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Damn, what the hell is this bullshit!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His head buzzed with confusion. All this information was too much to process.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne, get down!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, the beautiful woman lunged at him, knocking him to the floor. A shot cracked through the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A large man, who had just pulled out a pistol, fell to the ground with a thud. A huge hole appeared in his chest, his blood splattering everywhere.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His dying words came out in a wet gurgle, "Mr. Augustine Hawthorne says... trash like you... doesn't deserve... the Godfather's seat..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander went ghost-white, staring at the growing pool of red.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've got your back, Mr. Hawthorne. Don't worry!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The woman helped him up, barking orders to clean up the mess.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That's when it hit him - he knew her face from TV. Alice Watts, the Saint Group chairman's secretary.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alice was a total package - drop-dead gorgeous with killer curves, but don't let that fool you. She was a cold-blooded marksman with a mind sharp as a razor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thanks to her, the Saint Group was now at the top of Loscity's business world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She sized up Alexander, underwhelmed. She hadn't expected the Godfather's illegitimate son to be such an ordinary man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne, you're now Saint Group's chairman. Here's the five hundred grand for your daughter's medical bills." She popped open a briefcase, fresh bills still smelling of ink.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander massaged his temples, muttering, "Everyone out. I need space... And keep my identity under wraps. Nobody needs to know who I really am."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alice waved her hand, and everyone quietly exited. Then she headed to the roof.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Pulling out her phone, she video-called the Godfather.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kneeling on one knee, she spoke respectfully, "Godfather, are there any other orders?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The screen showed only the back of an old man in a leather chair. His silver hair and stooped shoulders screamed 'fragile,' but his presence could make the air freeze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He coughed, not bothering to turn around. "Start the clock. He's got one year to prove himself."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Another cough. "Let's hope Augustine or Anthony don't kill him first. But that's our family's curse - only the strongest becomes Godfather. He's got my blood; he'll face the same trial."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Understood, Godfather."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alice frowned. Alexander was just some nobody from the streets, yet his brothers could run billion-dollar empires, command armies of loyal followers, and kill without blinking. He didn't seem to stand a chance!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But as the secretary to the chairman, her fate was tied to his now. If either brother won, she'd be dead meat for backing the wrong horse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a hint of doubt, Alice asked, "Godfather, something's odd."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne asked me to keep his identity a secret, and also his chairmanship. Why he wants to do that? "</span></p><div class="pagination">
