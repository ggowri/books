  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lara hesitated, unsure of how to respond. Alexander's displeasure was immediate.</span><span> </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What kind of attitude is that? Ms. Hansen is your boss, and she needs permission to see her own grandfather?" he demanded.</span><span> </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mateo gave Alexander a cold look.</span><span> </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, this is a private Hansen family matter. It doesn't concern you. I've told you, Mr. Hansen is meeting an important guest, and not just anyone can interrupt."</span><span> </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was clear Mateo had no intention of respecting Lara. The two men in black behind him moved aggressively towards Alexander.</span><span> </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Step aside!"</span><span> </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a swift motion, Alexander grabbed one by the throat and tossed him aside. Fortunately, he held back, and the men only stumbled.</span><span> </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mateo quickly drew his gun, pointing it at Alexander, escalating the tension.</span><span> </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What are you doing? Put the gun away and let them in," Ralph's weak voice called from inside the room.</span><span> </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Reluctantly, Mateo shot Alexander another fierce glare but holstered his gun and stepped aside. Alexander walked forward, deliberately bumping Mateo, causing him to stagger and glare even more.</span><span> </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inside, Alexander saw Ralph seated with a stern-looking man who radiated authority. A bodyguard in a crisp military uniform stood behind him. All eyes were on Alexander as he entered.</span><span> </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lara quickly said, "Grandpa, I invited Alexander to help you."</span><span> </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ralph pulled his granddaughter close, smiling bitterly.</span><span> </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lara, I appreciate your concern, but my time is running out. I really don't have much longer..."</span><span> </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man beside Ralph studied Alexander and then smiled.</span><span> </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Seeing is believing. I didn't expect the developer of the magic powder to be so young."</span><span> </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ralph introduced him.</span><span> </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is Mr. Thompson, the Commander of Northern Command!"</span><span> </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander and Lara were taken aback. A general had arrived, and he outranked Schroder, yet they seemed to be on opposing sides.</span><span> </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quentin chuckled.</span><span> </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Schroder doesn't know I'm in </span><span>Loscity</span><span>. His greed has clouded his judgment. His actions are his own, not the military's."</span><span> </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander felt relieved; direct confrontation with the military was unwise. While he could defend himself, his family and friends might suffer. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since Schroder was acting independently, Alexander saw a chance to set things right.</span><span> </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quentin's smile faded as he spoke seriously.</span><span> </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My visit is related to the magic powder. The military wants to collaborate with you and purchase it as a strategic reserve at a fair price. Its benefits for alertness, pain relief, and potential enhancement are remarkable. I hope you won't refuse, Alexander."</span><span> </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander asked calmly, "What do you consider a fair price?"</span><span> </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quentin thought for a moment.</span><span> </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Half the market price. But there are additional benefits. You'll become a special military supplier and receive the rank of Major."</span><span> </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Half?!" Alexander felt conflicted, but the role of special supplier and Major was appealing.</span><span> </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Thompson, isn't half too low? It should be at least two-thirds; otherwise, I'd rather pass on being a supplier or a Major."</span><span> </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In truth, the cost of magic powder was about one-fifth, so even at half the market price, Alexander would profit greatly.</span><span> </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The bodyguard behind Quentin shouted angrily, "How dare you speak to Mr. Thompson like that?"</span><span> </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quentin raised a hand to silence him, then spoke with interest.</span><span> </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I hear your medical skills are exceptional and you know some sorcery. If you can cure Ralph, I might have another task for you. The price is negotiable if you can help."</span><span> </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, it's a deal!" Alexander agreed without hesitation and approached Ralph. He began by visually examining Ralph, then used Force Sense to assess his condition. Ralph watched with a frown, still skeptical of Alexander's abilities.</span></p><div class="pagination">
