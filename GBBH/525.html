  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The motorcycle team picked up Rosalia and others and sped towards </span><span>Kingsdon</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>An hour later, they arrived at an inconspicuous hotel in the suburbs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brittany complained tenderly, "Alexander, you are so partial. You haven't come to see me for such a long time."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, I'm really busy..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander felt a little embarrassed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After they had sex, the two had very little contact.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brittany said, "Alexander, Ashley is so cute but doesn't let me hold her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brittany smiled and reached out to touch Ashley's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unexpectedly, Ashley looked at her vigilantly and muttered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't even think about dating my dad. My dad likes Ava very much."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not only Alexander was stunned, but Brittany also stood there in a daze, helpless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at Brittany's embarrassed expression, Alexander couldn't help but burst out laughing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brittany said, "Baby, no one wants to take your dad away."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Brittany spoke, she grabbed Alexander's waist hard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ashley snorted and closed her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The atmosphere was a little awkward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is Felix at the headquarters of the Red Umbrella Group?" Alexander asked, changing the subject.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brittany blinked and </span><span>said</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"According to intelligence, Felix is no longer at the headquarters. We are investigating where he went. There should be news soon."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander nodded, then handed Ashley to Rosalia and told her to protect Ashley.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's have a talk in the room."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander extended an invitation to Brittany who was eagerly waiting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brittany suddenly became excited.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She hadn't had contact with a man for a long time since she had sex with Alexander. She could not forget the happiness that Alexander brought her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brittany snuggled in Alexander's arms and happily took him into her room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosalia held Ashley in her arms and looked at Alexander with resentment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Of course, Alexander felt Rosalia's gaze and couldn't help but smile bitterly. He had ignored Rosalia during this period of time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, now he had to take Brittany's feelings into consideration. Alexander could use the military airport and avoid the people from the Red Umbrella Group because Brittany had asked Quentin for help.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as they entered the room, Brittany threw Alexander onto the bed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She said, "Alexander, I miss you so much. Don't forget that I will be yours for the rest of my life!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brittany took the initiative to kiss Alexander, trying her best to please him in a strange but enthusiastic way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander moved her and was the light in her life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wanted to keep Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, I want you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brittany panted and reached into Alexander's pants.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smiled and asked, "You really don't mind the women around me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brittany panicked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She said, "Alexander, don't you like me anymore? I've figured it out a long time ago. Just like my grandfather said, a man of your strength can't be surrounded by only one woman."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander sighed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Brittany, but I always feel sorry for you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brittany was stunned, then hugged him tightly and sobbed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She said, "Alexander, I don't care how many women you have. As long as you don't despise me, I will be with you..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your grandfather is a general. That would be very unfair to you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander said this, but he was very happy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brittany cried sadly. Even though she was in tears, she still held Alexander tightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brittany was really devoted to being with him. Alexander was completely relaxed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked down at Brittany. Two buttons of her clothes were undone. Her breasts were wobbly, and her areola was a natural pink.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander said, "Let me feel it and see if you've been using beauty cream recently. They are getting bigger again..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander reached his hand into Brittany's bra, grabbed one of her breasts and rubbed it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was too big to cover in one hand, soft. And it was kneaded into many shapes in his palm. And it felt wonderful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, I want you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brittany couldn't help it, so she grabbed Alexander and gave him a kiss.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander let out a long sigh of relief.</span></p><div class="pagination">
