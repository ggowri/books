  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander's skilled hands traced over every inch of Melin's delicate skin, leaving her mind blank as if her entire body was lifted into the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her skin burned with heat, flushed with a deep crimson as she clung to the bed sheets, unable to resist the overwhelming sensation. She twisted and tangled like a seductively coiled serpent, consumed by the moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The night had deepened, and Melin, exhausted, had fallen asleep.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Alexander remained wide awake, his energy still sharp as a knife. He slipped out silently, like a shadow, to the ventilation shaft outside the public restroom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>From Melin's account, the assassin had slipped through a vent only a few inches wide.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Hmph! Let's see who Yinson sent to hurt my woman," Alexander muttered coldly, his voice laced with disdain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He was fiercely protective, and Yinson's actions&mdash;poisoning Melin and sending an assassin&mdash;wouldn't go unpunished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>While Melin slept, Alexander quietly fetched some food and drinks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When he returned, he placed everything carefully by her bedside. Melin was sleeping soundly, her complexion already returning to normal, no longer showing signs of distress.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With a deep breath, Alexander sat at the edge of the bed, meditating in silence, grounding himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Suddenly, something stirred in the air. His senses sharpened. He turned his head to look at Melin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She was awake, staring at him intently. Her cheeks were flushed, her eyes glistening with a soft, unfathomable depth, lost in thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Just as Alexander was about to tell her to sit up and eat, his brows furrowed in sudden concern. He raised a hand, signaling her to stay silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Melin's instincts kicked in immediately. Her eyes widened in alarm, and without a sound, she reached beneath the pillow to retrieve her handgun.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At that moment, a shadow flitted across the window, moving like a wraith.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It wasn't just any shadow&mdash;it was a figure cloaked in darkness, drifting through the window like a swirling mass of smoke.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was Loren, his gaunt frame barely the size of a child's, yet his face was an old, withered mask of wrinkles that didn't match his small, skeletal body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander remained still, his breath steady and controlled. He was hidden in the darkness, blending seamlessly into the shadows. Loren didn't notice him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Loren's black robe fluttered like a shroud, its filthy hem brushing the ground as he crept closer, his movements almost imperceptible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In his hand, he held a slender, three-edged dagger, its surface catching the faint light from outside, casting an eerie, dark gleam.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He moved like a cat, his steps soundless, inching closer with deadly intent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Just as Alexander thought Loren would strike at Melin, the assassin leapt, as weightless as a feather, and suddenly he was above him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Die!" Loren shouted, his voice like a screech, as the dagger plunged down toward Alexander's head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Whoosh!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But it was just a phantom of Alexander. The dagger sliced through the air, missing by a hair's breadth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Loren's eyes widened in shock. He had never imagined someone could move faster than he did.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before Loren could react, Alexander's cold voice rang out from behind him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You're sent by Yinson, aren't you? All of Sakura Society's people are going to die."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Loren froze, his face twisting with rage. "How do you know I'm with Sakura Society?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His expression was twisted, like the face of a vengeful ghost, full of fury and disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He hadn't succeeded in his assassination attempt, and now he was retreating slowly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even though Loren had enhanced his speed with an Immortality Serum, making him as fast as a level-four metahuman, he realized he was no match for Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He had no choice&mdash;he knew when a fight was lost.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The pressure from Alexander's lethal aura shattered his confidence like a collapsing mountain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A deadly silence settled between them, broken only by Loren's painstakingly slow movements as he backed away like a cornered animal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander remained motionless, a slight, cold smile playing at the corner of his lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Melin, sensing the danger, sprang from the bed with quick reflexes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She darted behind Alexander, her gun aimed at Loren, her hands steady but her heart racing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Come on! Shoot me!" Loren taunted, standing near the window but unwilling to make a move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He knew that if he jumped, Alexander would strike first, exposing his weakness&mdash;and he'd be dead before he hit the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Instead, he hoped that Melin might make a mistake, giving him a slim chance to escape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander seemed to read his mind. Without hesitation, he swiped Melin's gun aside, denying Loren any opportunity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Loren's heart sank. Despair gripped him like a vise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He held the dagger tight, his body bent low, preparing to jump&mdash;but he was paralyzed by fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His entire body was drenched in sweat, his hands trembling despite his best efforts to stay composed. Even the sweat dripping from his forehead barely registered as he struggled not to blink.</span></p><div class="pagination">
