  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander swung the Lightsaber and chopped off Dereck's head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The bloody head rolled on the ground and was kicked away by Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This </span><span>man</span><span> who used fetuses to refine demon puppets deserved this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander stood proudly, pointing his Lightsaber at the Mafia and the Weaver family, and issued a challenge expressionlessly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Any other strong men? Don't waste time. Come on!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The members of the Mafia and the Weaver family were all quiet. And no one dared to speak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paxton and Beverly looked gloomy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They thought that they were well prepared. With six powerful men plus the wizard, Dereck, they thought they would be able to destroy the Axe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had not imagined that all the strong men would be killed by Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bastard, what are you doing?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paxton shouted angrily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The person in front not only did not attack but immediately retreated behind Paxton and let him out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What the hell! Do you want to rebel?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paxton was so angry that his face turned pale.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The six experts sent by the headquarters were half of the twelve guards of the Mafia. Even the most elite special forces were far from their match.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And Dereck was a ruthless killer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In desperation, Paxton and Beverly retreated, trying to get away from Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander stared at them, faced the guns, and walked towards the two calmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What do you want?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paxton was horrified by Alexander's murderous intent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill him now! Kill him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beverly couldn't stand this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She screamed wildly, raised her gun, and fired at Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A magazine of bullets was emptied in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill him! Kill him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paxton also roared and shot at Alexander fiercely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fierce gunfire rang out again. Hundreds of guns were fired at Alexander as if to reduce him to ashes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander had disappeared as if he had never appeared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All the bullets hit the open ground, leaving craters.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next second, Alexander suddenly appeared in front of several corpses, picked up guns from the ground with both hands and started firing fiercely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander had an illusion that he was playing a shooting game.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't need to aim at all. His All-seeing Eyes could lock onto dozens of targets at the same time. And then he could pull the trigger continuously and shoot at the targets.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two guns had fired all the bullets, and more than thirty people from the Axe had fallen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander dropped the guns, picked up two more from the ground, and continued firing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under the control of powerful strength, as long as Alexander pulled the trigger, someone fell.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was alone, shooting with guns he picked up, but he unleashed terrifying lethality.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Mafia and the Weaver family fell one after another.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paxton and Beverly were panicked. They knew that they would be defeated. Not only would they not be able to destroy the Axe, but they themselves would also be killed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fire! Fire! Kill him now! Or I will kill you," Paxton yelled wildly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes were full of fear, and he kept aiming and shooting at Alexander, but he could not keep up with Alexander's speed. All the bullets were gone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone knew how terrifying Alexander was. And they concentrated their firepower to kill him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The rain of bullets was pouring down like a rainstorm. Alexander used sandbags, brick walls, trees, and other things as cover and quickly approached Paxton.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Axe had already come to their senses and were cooperating with Alexander's attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Alexander's fast and accurate shooting, the Axe immediately suppressed the enemy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paxton felt like he was about to collapse. He yelled and cursed, venting his fear and anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn... What monster is this guy? He must be a devil. A devil that came from hell!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The experts sent by the headquarters died, and Paxton's own men fell one after another.</span></p><div class="pagination">
