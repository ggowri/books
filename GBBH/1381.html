  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander looked at the three men and said in a serious tone, "Send eighty percent of the silver from both Gang to Kean Manor. Don't change the name of Sacred Spirit Gang for now. Josh and Ryker will stay here permanently&mdash;s</span><span>tay alert, keep the surface calm but remain cautious. If anyone comes looking for the Risunese leaders, just say they've temporarily returned to Risun for urgent matters. If anyone insists, detain them and inform me immediately!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ivan will go to Tiger Gang. The two gangs will support each other. You three need to keep your men in check and train them carefully."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Josh and the other two agreed immediately. After a hearty meal, night had fallen. Alexander and Logan shared a sleeping mat in one of the stronghold's rooms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Logan, we've been here for a year now. We have money, we have men... but I can't seem to feel happy about it. I have this nagging feeling that something big is coming."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Logan's eyes shifted as he thought for a moment.&nbsp;"Alexander, between Kean Manor, Tiger Gang, and Sacred Spirit Gang, we have over five thousand men and hundreds of thousands of coins. You're also a level-four warrior now. If fate brought us here, there has to be a reason for it. Don't overthink it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Two days later, in the&nbsp;main hall&nbsp;of the&nbsp;Kean Manor, Alexander, Logan, and Vegeta were interrogating&nbsp;Klein Hemsworth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Klein's&nbsp;joints had been dislocated, and he was tightly bound with&nbsp;water-soaked buffalo tendons. His&nbsp;pink long robe&nbsp;was tattered, and his&nbsp;braided hairwas in complete disarray.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His face was pale, and his&nbsp;sharp, venomous eyes&nbsp;glared at Alexander.&nbsp;"How do you know the Turtle Sage Sect's energy techniques? Who the hell are you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's face was ice-cold as he spoke.&nbsp;"Klein, you don't need to worry about who I am. I want your martial arts techniques. If you want to live, make your choice."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Klein roared wildly,&nbsp;"Dream on! Risunese warriors don't fear death!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Logan lost his temper. He stormed up and&nbsp;smacked Klein across the face repeatedly&nbsp;while yelling,&nbsp;"Damn Risunese bastard! Let's see you act tough now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Klein's&nbsp;chest heaved, blood seeping from the corners of his mouth. As a&nbsp;peak level-four warrior, being slapped around by a mere&nbsp;level-two warrior&nbsp;like Logan was utterly unbearable!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander suddenly&nbsp;let out a cold chuckle.&nbsp;"Klein, I don't waste pleasantries on animals! Vegeta, take him away. Let him experience the Ten Tortures I told you about.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They say a level-four warrior's body is reborn&mdash;bones as strong as steel, energy flowing abundantly. I wonder how long you, a so-called master, can endure?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the mention of the&nbsp;Ten Tortures, Vegeta's face&nbsp;turned pale. Without a word, he grabbed Klein and&nbsp;dragged him away. Klein didn't say a word&mdash;his face was ashen with despair...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A few days later, Alexander and Logan arrived outside&nbsp;the Hall of Lives&nbsp;within&nbsp;Dominion Church.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The&nbsp;Hall of Lives&nbsp;exuded an ancient and solemn charm. Its&nbsp;light-blue walls&nbsp;and&nbsp;arched crimson-red gate&nbsp;bore the words&nbsp;"Hall of Lives"&nbsp;in bold, powerful strokes, radiating an air of dignity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Outside,&nbsp;over a hundred people&nbsp;crowded together, chattering amongst themselves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sigh... when will I ever get my hands on a thousand-year snow lotus..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm here for an elixir that enhances the Force!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander walked up and&nbsp;gently knocked&nbsp;on the&nbsp;door ring. A&nbsp;young nun&nbsp;opened it slightly and asked what they wanted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander put his hands together in respect and bowed.&nbsp;"Master, I am Alexander from the Outer Court. I have come today to seek medicine. May I enter?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander only had one Docpirin pill left. Logan still had a full bottle, but it was always better to be prepared. The effects of Docpirin were nothing short of miraculous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The main ingredient was millennium ginseng. He had already purchased all the other medicinal herbs from the top apothecaries in Darwin, but millennium ginseng was nowhere to be found.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>According to Sellers, rare millennium herbs were nearly impossible to come by. If there was any chance of obtaining one, it would be here at the Hall of Lives&mdash;but it all depended on fate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Hall of Lives was known as a sacred land for spiritual medicine, rumored to hold countless miraculous elixirs. Getting even a small amount could be life-changing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, very few people were ever granted medicine from the Hall of Lives. That's why, after returning from the martial arena, Alexander had arranged for Logan to come with him&mdash;hoping to try their luck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The young priest at the gate listened to Alexander's request but said nothing. Instead, he quietly shut the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander and Logan exchanged glances, both feeling frustrated. They didn't dare knock again, but they were also unwilling to leave just yet, so they stayed put.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, a group of people arrived at the entrance of the&nbsp;Hall of Lives, surrounding a young man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wore a&nbsp;golden crown, securing his hair in place, and was dressed in a&nbsp;gold-threaded martial robe. His&nbsp;sharp black eyes&nbsp;gleamed with confidence, and his face carried an air of arrogance. He casually waved a&nbsp;folding fan, glancing sideways at those around him as if they were mere attendants, mere background characters to highlight his own importance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As he approached the temple gate, his gaze briefly swept over Alexander and Logan. Then, with a casual flick of his hand through the air, an&nbsp;invisible force&nbsp;pushed against them, sending them&nbsp;stumbling back several steps.</span></p><div class="pagination">
