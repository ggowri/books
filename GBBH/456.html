Now that things are settled, shouldn't you buy me a drink?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, yes. It's been too long since we last met. We definitely need to have a good drink..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two generals, with arms slung over each other's shoulders, walked away, chatting and laughing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All the soldiers turned in unison and marched away in perfect formation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The scene fell into a deathly silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The manor remained tightly shut. No more members of the Red Umbrella Group appeared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The bounty hunters who had come for the half-a-billion-dollar bounty were highly disappointed, grumbling as they retreated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They never expected that two ruthless and high-ranking generals would join forces to help Alexander rescue his daughter and safely extract Ashley from the Red Umbrella Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All the families and power organizations in </span><span>Loscity's</span><span> apprehension and fear of Alexander reached new heights.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inside the manor, Felix raged.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Useless! Worthless trash!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He kicked at Raven's remains viciously, what was left of his over hundred-pound body now just a bit of residual flesh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking of Kyle's miserable death only fueled his anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From Kyle and Raven, Felix saw his own potential end.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he would never yield the position of Godfather to Alexander!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kyle and Raven had genetic backups, right? Immediately initiate the cloning and rebirth process. Add their clones to the refinement plan. Both of them are level-one metahumans. We can definitely extract the Elixir of Life from their bodies to quickly enhance my strength," Felix ordered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As you command, Mr. Vanderbilt," several experts in white lab coats quickly agreed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The leading white-bearded old man frowned, "Mr. Vanderbilt, the S-class genetic modification serum we injected into Ashley is not yet finalized.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I estimate that Ashley will undergo some unknown mutation within a week. It's very dangerous. You should leave </span><span>Loscity</span><span> and return to </span><span>Kingsdon</span><span> as soon as possible!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix grinned and waved his hand dismissively.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dave, don't think I'm afraid of Alexander. He's at most a level-two metahuman, while I'm already level three.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If it weren't for Quentin and Theodore meddling, I could have captured Alexander the moment he set foot in the manor. I could not only get the potion formula but also make him wish he was dead!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dave Perez nodded vigorously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Vanderbilt, your talent is exceptional. You are the most compatible </span><span>neohuman</span><span> I've ever seen with the potential serum."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix's smile faded, his face expressionless as he said, "Inform Barry that his son, Raven, was killed by Alexander. Isn't Barry about to become a level-three metahuman?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"When Ashley turns into a monster, Alexander will surely come to </span><span>Kingsdon</span><span> to avenge her. I want to see how Barry kills Alexander!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, Mr. Vanderbilt."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His subordinate understood and hurried to comply.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix's face twisted into a sinister expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He muttered to himself, "Alexander, you're not qualified to compete with me. The position of Godfather can only be mine!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On Treasure Island, a mysterious figure in a black cloak was pushing a grey-haired elder in a wheelchair along the beach.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A gentle sea breeze brought the scent of freshness and saltiness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The beach was filled with people of all ages swimming and sunbathing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were sun umbrellas and beach chairs everywhere. Beauties in bikinis strolled about, and people playing beach volleyball, as well as vendors selling ice cream and snacks&mdash;everything one would expect from a seaside resort.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This place seemed not to be the feared dangerous ground but some kind of beach resort.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The elder gazed at the building of the Brilliant Group with a very complicated expression.</span></p><div class="pagination">
