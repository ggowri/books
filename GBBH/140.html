  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander tapped into the Force, sprinting with all his might toward </span><span>the direction</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even s</span><span>tray cats and dogs felt the terrifying aura, scattering as if he were the king of beasts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, </span><span>Lara</span><span> lay pinned down by Drake, unable to move, her muffled cries barely audible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let me go!" </span><span>Lara</span><span> struggled desperately, tears streaming down her face</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Drake's ugly, twisted face leered at her, his bony fingers exploring her body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's not my fault." He sneered. "You heard him threaten me&mdash;he practically forced me to do this. Blame him, not me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He continued to grope her greedily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her smooth, tender skin, her full chest, her curvy hips&mdash;he was completely enthralled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll kill you!" </span><span>Lara</span><span> </span><span>cursed</span><span> furiously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You'll be begging for more soon. Being with me is better than wasting yourself on Alexander." Drake's face twisted with a depraved smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, sweetheart, we have all the time in the world."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He caressed and kissed </span><span>Lara</span><span> slowly, taking pleasure in her curses and struggles with </span><span>some</span><span> perverse satisfaction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Please...Alexander...save me..." In that moment, Alexander was her only hope.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her voice was hoarse from screaming, but still, there was no sign of </span><span>Alexander</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If she truly had to suffer at this old monster's hands, </span><span>Lara</span><span> would rather end her life to cleanse herself of the humiliation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop yelling and shut up!" Drake slapped her across the face, leaving her dizzy and disoriented.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kneel!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He forcefully bent her over with her large smooth buttocks towards him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a violent rip, her dress was torn apart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her pale skin was exposed, contrasting with the black lace of her </span><span>thong</span><span>&mdash;an </span><span>irresistible sight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Drake's eyes almost popped out, his mouth watering.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You look amazing! Wearing something this daring&mdash;who are you trying to impress? Doesn't matter. I'm going to make sure you enjoy this."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Like a mad dog, he threw himself on her, grabbing and kissing forcefully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The scent of her skin mixed with her perfume drove him nearly to madness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't touch me...let me go...I'll kill you!" </span><span>Lara</span><span> sobbed, struggling with all her </span><span>strength</span><span>, but her resistance was futile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop crying. It's annoying!" Drake slapped her </span><span>butt </span><span>again, leaving her with a flushed red mark.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You brought this on yourself!" From his cloak, he took out a few small jars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He revealed several small green insects crawling quickly inside, radiating an eerie aura.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Drake held one of the insects up, smiling wickedly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you know what this is? I spent years in Thailand breeding these special bugs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Any woman infected by this will become my slave, completely willing to obey me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lara</span><span> looked at the bugs in horror, feeling sick to her stomach.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You monster! Get away from me! I'd rather die than let you control me. Alexander will come to save me, and you'll pay for this!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He'll never find you." Drake sneered, pushing one of the bugs into her mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lara</span><span> felt it crawling down her throat, nearly passing out from fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sweetheart, in a bit, you're going to be begging for more."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He waited patiently for the bug</span><span> to work</span><span>. He was sure that</span><span> </span><span>Lara</span><span> would soon </span><span>give it </span><span>to him uncontrollably.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can't wait to taste your ass and impregnate you!" Drake's eyes sparkled with twisted desire.</span></p><div class="pagination">
