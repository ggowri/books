  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gavin burst into laughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I heard that Asher wants you to go to West Cemetery to catch someone the day after tomorrow. Will you go?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gavin asked with a serious expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What? About this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Oliver widened his eyes in surprise and asked quickly, "Mr. Gavin Lawson, is Asher trying to harm me? I heard that your granddaughter and Asher are engaged, right? Please help me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gavin sighed helplessly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Grace doesn't like Asher and has fallen in love with another man. I am helpless."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Oliver was even more confused now and didn't understand the connection between the two events.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Oliver thought, "How did Gavin know that Asher called me?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Could it be that there is an undercover agent from the Lawson family around Asher? Or someone around me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Oliver didn't dare to think any further and broke out in a cold sweat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gavin said, "What did he say specifically? Tell me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gavin pushed a cup of coffee to Oliver.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Oliver felt a little relieved and thought Gavin would help him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Therefore, Oliver told Gavin carefully everything Asher said on the phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gavin drank coffee while tapping his fingers on the table.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Having heard Oliver's words, he chuckled and asked, "Do you know who Oliver wants you to catch in the cemetery the day after tomorrow?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Who?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Oliver's eyes widened, filled with confusion and expectation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Alexander!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The name caused Oliver's cup to fall to the ground and shatter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander was now not only the top gangster in Loscity, but the only heir to the Godfather.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With Ultimate Alliance's powerful military force and economic strength of hundreds of billions of dollars a year, it would be easy for Alexander to kill Oliver.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even the mayor and the governor had to maintain friendly relations with Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Oliver said, "Mr. Gavin Lawson, why did Alexander and Asher have a conflict? What should I do? Please help me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He was anxious as he couldn't afford to offend them both.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gavin said expressionlessly, "Axel had his eyes on a cemetery in West Cemetery, but Alexander's mother was buried there. So, Alexander beat up the men Asher sent to dig the grave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"At present, Asher does not know that the owner of the cemetery is Alexander. He's officially buying the West Cemetery the day after tomorrow and wants you to take your men to keep the peace in case anything goes wrong."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Oliver's face turned cold, and he was shaking with anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He said, "The Vance family did such a bad thing, and Asher wants to get me into trouble. I'm so angry!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although Oliver was angry, he couldn't afford to offend the Vance family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He said, "Mr. Gavin Lawson, what should I do? I can't afford to offend Asher and Alexander."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A sly smile appeared on Gavin's face, and he leisurely took out a cigarette.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Oliver quickly lit it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gavin smoked, and Oliver fidgeted with anxiety.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After a while, Gavin said calmly, "You can only hide from this matter and stay out of this."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Oliver said helplessly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"They will definitely fight in the cemetery the day after tomorrow. If something happens, I'll lose my job."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gavin said with a smile, "If everything goes as expected, Alexander will come to see me before tomorrow at the latest."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Oliver asked curiously, "Mr. Gavin Lawson, are you going to help Alexander instead of Asher?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gavin had a bitter expression and sighed again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Well, Grace fell in love with Alexander at first sight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"She's my only granddaughter, and I can't say no to her. Besides, Alexander is quite capable and should have a brighter future than just being a gangster boss."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Oliver was shocked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The granddaughter of the second most important figure in Avalora actually fell in love with Alexander!</span></p><div class="pagination">
