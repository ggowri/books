It was too much of a coincidence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After wracking his brain without reaching any conclusions, he decided to hurry back and ask Ava about the mysterious man who had been following her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Alexander returned to the mansion, he was surprised to find a lavish welcome party in full swing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava had organized it, especially for him, and the atmosphere was electric.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The cream of </span><span>Loscity</span><span> society had turned out in force to welcome Alexander home.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite the raging epidemic outside, the wealthy district maintained strict security measures, with daily rapid testing by medical staff to ensure everyone's safety.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As a result, life in </span><span>Loscity's</span><span> most exclusive neighborhood continued in its usual decadent fashion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By now, most people knew Alexander wasn't just the developer of magic powder but also the mastermind behind Ultimate Alliance. It was an opportunity to curry favor with him and was too good to pass up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Ultimate Alliance being </span><span>Loscity's</span><span> dominant force, getting on Alexander's good side was seen as a guaranteed path to profit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The social elite had turned out in their finest, drinking and laughing as they mingled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava emerged in an elegant white evening gown that showcased her beauty, its low back adding just the right touch of allure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>True to her reputation as </span><span>Loscity's</span><span> most beautiful woman, she instantly commanded everyone's attention.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The guests flocked around </span><span>her,</span><span> faces plastered with ingratiating smiles as they showered her with compliments.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne is here!" someone suddenly called out, causing all heads to turn toward the entrance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There</span><span> stood Alexander, cutting a dashing figure as he strode confidently into the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava immediately rushed to Alexander, ignoring everyone else, and threw herself into his arms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They shared a passionate kiss, oblivious to their surroundings, drawing cheers and applause from the crowd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The men envied Alexander while the women shot jealous glances at Ava.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rebecca and Mary appeared then, gathering around Alexander as well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Watching Alexander's intimate interactions with these stunning women, the guests couldn't help but whisper among themselves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One man pulled some others aside and muttered conspiratorially, "Did you hear? They say Ms. Hansen and Mary are both Alexander's lovers."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you crazy?" his companion hissed. "Even if that's true, you'd better keep your mouth shut. If Mr. Hawthorne hears you gossiping, you'll be in deep trouble."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're right, you're right! I didn't say anything, I swear!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The guy who'd been trying to show off how well-informed he was suddenly went pale and shut his mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Alexander and Rebecca decided to target him, he knew he wouldn't last a day in </span><span>Loscity</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's arrival had become the highlight of the evening.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He heard every word of their whispered conversations but merely smiled, completely unfazed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When one reached a certain level of power, other people's opinions became as insignificant as ants crawling on the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Oscar came over with a fawning smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bro, I'm here first to welcome you home and second because I've got an old friend who's not doing so well. I was hoping you could take a look at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I know you're busy, so I left him outside. Didn't dare bring him in. Hope you don't mind."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Given Alexander's deep connection with Nancy, the head of The Kaylon, Oscar had no choice but to humble himself with this request.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh? Not doing well? Let's cut to the chase. Has he caught the plague?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander asked bluntly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Oscar's face fell, and he nodded sheepishly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, you saw right through it. Look, if this guy wasn't like a brother to me, I wouldn't dream of asking something so risky. I know it's dangerous to be around infected people."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander waved his hand dismissively.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's fine. Actually, I've been wanting to study this plague situation anyway."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Oscar immediately perked up and rushed to add.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My friend is the chief designer for the military's R&amp;D division. All the combat armor and combat exoskeletons are his work. If you can cure him, there'll definitely be something in it for you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's eyes lit up. Talk about a lucky break - precisely what he needed falling right into his lap.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He'd been looking to establish a channel to purchase these two pieces of equipment from the military, planning to ask Quentin for help, but now the opportunity had practically walked through his door.</span></p><div class="pagination">
