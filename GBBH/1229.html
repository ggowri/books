  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, in a skyscraper somewhere in </span><span>Risun</span><span>...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yinson put down the satellite phone, his face dark with concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The secret facility in </span><span>Newbrook</span><span> had been completely compromised&mdash;worse yet, several vials of pure Immortality Serum had been stolen right out from under their noses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His underground sources had confirmed that Quentin was behind the raid, though Quentin was just the public face. There were some serious heavy hitters pulling the strings behind the scenes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But that wasn't what really got under Yinson's skin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What really pissed him off was Alexander's involvement. That bastard had single-handedly made it possible for Quentin's team to walk right in and take the facility like they were picking up takeout.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn you, Alexander!" Yinson slammed his fist on the desk.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He'd spent years developing dozens of test subjects, and now several of his best ones had been taken out by Alexander's hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That little punk Alexander is tougher than I expected," Yinson muttered to himself. "We might need to deploy our more advanced test subjects to take him down."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a moment of consideration, he shook his head. It wasn't time to show their trump card yet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In just one month, he'd be ready to launch the "Apocalypse Project" for real, and then everyone would dance to his tune.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, Alexander," he sneered. "You think hiding out on Treasure Island will save you? Keep dreaming, buddy. I'll teach you what real fear feels like. And you can kiss </span><span>Louvian</span><span> Port goodbye."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yinson rocked back and forth in his executive chair, his face twisting between wicked grins and dark scowls.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If anyone had walked in and seen him like this, they'd have sworn they were looking at the devil himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next day, Alexander called William and Logan to </span><span>Loscity</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Along with Augusta, Marvin, Rosalia, and Charlize, they made up his elite fighting force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But even these top fighters could barely hold their own against Sakra Society's test subjects&mdash;and that just wasn't good enough anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander had already taught them the basics of meditation, but now it was time to step things up. He decided to share some of the Warriors' advanced meditation techniques with his team.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If any of them showed the potential to awaken to the Force, Alexander planned to train them as Warriors&mdash;they'd be his real right-hand fighters then.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under his intensive training program, the group had already reached level-four metahuman status, and their combat skills weren't too shabby either.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Today, I'm going to teach you guys a special meditation technique," Alexander announced with a smile that did nothing to soften the bombshell he'd just dropped. "But first, you'll need to formally accept me as your master."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His goal was straightforward&mdash;he wanted to keep getting stronger himself while building up the Ultimate Alliance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Having a second Warrior would make dealing with Sakra Society's "Apocalypse Project" a whole lot easier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Plus, if things went sideways in the future, he'd have better odds of protecting his family and everyone else.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Augusta and the others couldn't believe their ears, but Alexander's dead-serious expression told them he meant business. They knew this was huge&mdash;the meditation techniques he'd taught them before had already cranked up their physical abilities and power levels big time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing him this serious now, they figured whatever he was about to teach them would blow their previous training out of the water.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Augusta was the first to drop to </span><span>his</span><span> </span><span>knees before Alexander, with the others quickly following suit as realization dawned on them. They all bowed their heads deeply, showing complete submission.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Good," Alexander said. "From now on, I'll be your master. If any of you truly master this meditation technique and awaken to the Force, you'll have the potential to become as powerful as I am one day."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a simple wave of his hand, an invisible energy lifted them back to their feet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Though I'm your master now, to the outside world, we'll maintain our roles as brothers-in-arms and subordinates," he continued. "I don't have many rules or requirements, except for one&mdash;you must never side with outsiders. Your loyalty belongs to the Ultimate Alliance and to me alone."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His voice turned ice-cold as he delivered the final warning. "If anyone betrays us, I will hunt them to the ends of the earth and eliminate them."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His piercing gaze swept across their faces as he unleashed his full power, letting them feel the weight of his strength.</span></p><div class="pagination">
