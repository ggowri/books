  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander frowned as he looked at Begeta and Nova, preparing to speak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Begeta understood that whether he and Nova could escape today's predicament hinged on Alexander's decision. He quickly pulled Nova close and bowed, saying slowly, "We are from the Noah Continent. Our tribe was taken over by the Noah Empire, and I, along with the rest of my people, were sold to Hrodvik by slave traders."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Begeta was a prince of his tribe. After their annexation by the Noah Empire, he and the remaining tribesmen were sold into slavery, suffering brutal treatment during the journey, which had claimed many lives.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon arriving outside the Darwin slave market, the slave trader's guard relaxed, and in a fit of rage, Begeta seized the opportunity to lead his people in a rebellion, killing the slave trader and his guards. However, they ended up exiled to Darwin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Noah people, they were met with distrust by the Hrodvik locals, and no one wanted to employ them. They were forced to survive by hunting and relying on their combat skills.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately, Dexter had learned of their uprising and exploited their situation, extorting their hard-earned money under the threat of exposure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Begeta felt powerless to resist. The Noah Empire no longer had a place for him, and if he lost his foothold in Hrodvik, he and his people would have no means of survival.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander rolled his eyes, placing his hands behind his back as he glared at the police. "Now you see it, don't you? The Noah slave trader got what he deserved!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The police exchanged glances, aware of Dexter's aggressive demeanor. One of them hesitated before responding, "This man killed a slave trader from Noah, so we don't really need to pursue the matter. However, they did kill someone, and since they lack registration, they should be expelled under the law. So..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander sighed, realizing that he wanted to help Begeta but felt utterly powerless. Violating Hrodvik's laws would only bring trouble from Julius.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sellers frowned; he didn't care much for the Noah people, having seen his father kill many of them. But seeing Alexander's determination to assist Begeta and Nova, he winked at Hogan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hogan caught the hint and smiled, saying, "Unregistered individuals can enlist as soldiers. If they survive 10 years, they'll receive registration!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's eyes lit up, and he quickly extended the offer to Begeta and Nova. "I serve the King with a fief of 30 miles and command a thousand elite soldiers!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Begeta frowned, his face paling. He knew that joining the military meant little, given his broken clan's status.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Hrodvik leaders held the power of life and death over them. What were they supposed to do?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Begeta's silence, the police moved to apprehend him and Nova.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Begeta couldn't help but recall the long journey to Hrodvik, the bodies of his people left behind, and the need to care for the remaining orphans and widows. Their faces haunted him&mdash;thin, pale, and terrified.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the police prepared to chain him, Begeta panicked, causing one of the officers to stumble and fall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He bowed slightly to Nova, saying, "My tribesmen and I are willing to serve you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Great!" Alexander grinned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Logan looked on with disdain as he shoved the police aside. "Get out!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dexter stepped forward, muttering, "We can't just..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The police shot him a glance. "And what do you suggest?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, they turned and walked away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dexter's anger flared as he watched them go, thinking, "They took my money and just walked off!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Turning to Alexander and the others, he stepped forward and bowed, "Mr. Hawthorne, where are you from?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander glanced at him, his tone cold. "I'm from the outer courtyard of Dominion Church."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Alexander helped Begeta and Nova to their feet and walked away with the group. Logan turned back, making a shooting gesture with his fingers at Dexter, even mimicking a gunshot sound.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dexter seethed with rage. Though he didn't grasp Logan's intent, he felt it was undoubtedly a provocation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you think I'm an easy target and that the outer courtyard of Dominion Church is so impressive? Just wait; I'll show you how powerful my brother is," he thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Alexander and the others entered the slave market, they found it sprawling and square-shaped, covering over three miles, lined with countless stone buildings and a vast open space at its center.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The open area was filled with iron cages holding slaves from various foreign lands, and the entire market was encircled by a tall bluestone wall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caltrops lined the top of the wall, and guards were stationed every few steps at all entrances and exits, ensuring tight security.</span></p><div class="pagination">
