  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If it had been an ordinary person, they would have been thrown out of the car after such a violent crash and spin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But both the driver and Alexander remained firmly seated, unmoving&mdash;clearly, the driver was no ordinary man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He was a formidable expert.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A shadow flitted across the scene, and Loren's withered figure appeared, swiftly crawling through the shattered window and landing behind Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His left chest was wrapped in thick bandages, now stained deep red with blood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Simeon, grab him! That's Alexander! If we kill him, Mr. White promised us five hundred million dollars&mdash;five hundred million!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Loren's voice was frantic, his grip tight around a sharp dagger, which he thrust directly at Alexander's back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Just as Alexander prepared to dodge, the driver, roaring like a wild gorilla, lunged at him, pinning him down with terrifying strength, trapping him in place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Get off me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander growled, using the Force to attempt a desperate struggle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The driver howled in pain as his arm cracked, but Alexander couldn't break free&mdash;not yet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His face darkened with realization; the driver's strength was at least on par with a level-four strength power, a force far stronger than even a silverback gorilla.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Thwack!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The dagger pierced the back of the seat, sinking into Alexander's flesh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It had been so long since Alexander had felt such excruciating pain&mdash;especially that cold, agonizing burn that seemed to sink into his bones. It was a pain that rattled him to his core.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Without a doubt, Loren had coated the blade with some kind of poison. Otherwise, Alexander wouldn't have felt such torment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even with the Force surging through him, he nearly lost the ability to move entirely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The driver, seeing Alexander injured, grinned maliciously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ha! I'm a level-four strength metahuman, and I was a world-class weightlifter before all this! With me here, there's no way you're getting out alive!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Simeon's arms bulged with muscles as thick as a normal person's thighs. He tightened his grip on Alexander, preventing him from escaping Loren's assault.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Loren snarled, his dagger flashing as he aimed for Alexander's neck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>From the passenger seat, Alexander couldn't see what was coming. He had no choice but to jerk his head to the side, narrowly avoiding the strike.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But the blade still grazed his skin, and an intense, searing pain exploded in his neck, nearly causing him to black out. The agony was overwhelming, a sensation so sharp it cut through his every nerve.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Normally, Alexander would have been immune to poisoning, but this time, the poison nearly got the best of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His fury ignited, burning like wildfire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With a roar that sounded almost like a dragon's fury, the Force surged out of him. The blast was so powerful that Loren hesitated, his hand shaking as the dagger nearly slipped from his grasp.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Simeon, face-to-face with Alexander, was blasted by the raw power of the Force. The shockwave sent him reeling, his vision spinning, legs buckling under the intensity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You're dead!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander's eyes burned red, veins pulsing with rage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He shot a look at Simeon, a single glance that sent the Force to its maximum limit. Blood-red tears streamed from his eyes as his Focus intensified.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Simeon caught in the power and staggered backward, releasing his grip on Alexander and lunging at Loren like a wild animal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His hands tightened around the dagger, disregarding the cuts on his fingers, blood dripping freely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Simeon! Are you out of your mind? What are you doing?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Loren's voice was filled with fury as he fought against the frenzied Simeon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He knew something was wrong&mdash;Simeon's actions were too erratic, too far from what was expected.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Loren had thought they had this&mdash;between his cunning and Simeon's strength, there was no way Alexander could survive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He was already gravely injured. Anyone else would have been finished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But then, Loren's expression shifted as he realized the truth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"No! He should be dead! He was poisoned!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Loren muttered in disbelief, watching as Alexander remained standing, alive, despite the poison.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The car, already small, had been further distorted by the crash.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander, weakened and poisoned, would have struggled to escape&mdash;yet he was still alive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Simeon, suddenly foaming at the mouth, spasms violently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His hands released Loren, and he fell back, convulsing on the floor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Idiot. Go to hell."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Loren sneered, raising the dagger, and with one swift movement, slashed it across Simeon's throat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Thud..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Simeon's massive head hit the car floor with a sickening thud, his blood splattering across Loren's face, blinding his eyes with crimson.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everything happened in an instant. Just as Loren was processing this, Alexander spun around and landed a punch square into Loren's left chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The sound of bones snapping echoed through the car, followed by Loren's gut-wrenching scream of pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Loren let out a violent cough, spewing blood toward Alexander as the force of the blow crushed his chest.</span></p><div class="pagination">
