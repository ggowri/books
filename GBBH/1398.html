Dozens of officers sat on both sides. Alexander and Fermin's three sons stood behind him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fermin said in a deep voice, "Generals, that short and strange man must be an expert above the Divine Transformation State. This time, we were fortunate to have the Invincible Golden Bead. I only have one such bead, and the power it gathers is too strong. As a level-five warrior, I used it, and my meridians and bones throughout my body have been severely injured. It will probably take several months to recover..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moses stepped forward and said, "Mr. Schneier, since the Risunese have violated the agreement by allowing level-five warriors to participate in the national war, we should seek help from the Dominion Church."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're right." Fermin nodded and issued an order. One hundred elite cavalry were to be selected, each with three horses, to travel day and night to Campbell and then return to Darwin for assistance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander thought, "This Invincible Golden Bead could gather the power of 500 thousand soldiers onto one person. No wonder I feel completely drained.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The power of 500 thousand soldiers... It must be considerable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Fermin said there's only one such bead. If that strange man comes again, it'll be really troublesome. I hope the Dominion Church can give help."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the top of the cliff of Hero Gorge, Frieza was in a rage. He slapped a huge rock. With a dull thud, the rock as big as an ox instantly turned into powder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fermin! Let me see how powerful you are!" Frieza suddenly laughed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Three days later, in the main tent of the Hrodvik army, the generals rushed to report to Fermin one after another, "Mr. Schneier, the soldiers in the vanguard camp are weak, with severe bone pain. The more elite they are, the worse the condition!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Schneier, the same is true in the rear camp!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The left-wing cavalry has the same condition!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I feel as if my bones are broken."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Quiet!" Alexander shouted. His face was ashen. "Send people to check the drinking water, food supplies, and whether there is an epidemic in the army."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was suspicious, thinking, "It seems that only I don't have any symptoms. Could it be because of the mysterious golden energy?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>An hour later, a military doctor rushed in to report, "Mr. Schneier, more than half of our food supplies have been mixed with an unknown poison. It's colorless and odorless. It's harmless to ordinary people, but it will slowly erode the bones and meridians of warriors. They will die with broken bones and dissolved meridians!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fermin gritted his teeth. "It must be Richie's trick. Immediately separate the non-poisoned people in each camp and gather them into a large camp."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes!" All the generals responded and left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sellers was so anxious that his face turned red. "Dad, I feel like my body is about to burst. Should we retreat?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No! We can't retreat!" Alexander suddenly shouted sternly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fermin stroked his long beard and asked, "Why?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander thought of all kinds of battle scenes from the movies and TV shows he had seen on the earth. After a while, he replied, "The defeat is like a landslide. Once we retreat, the enemy will chase us. Among the 500 thousand Hrodvik soldiers, less than one in ten will survive."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fermin's expression changed constantly. "You're right, but now, most of the elite troops in the army have lost their combat power, and I can't recover for several months. If that strange man comes again..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander frowned. He thought of these babies in the steaming pot in Walgus Church, the skinned men along the way, the raped women, and the mountains of bodies of 50 thousand soldiers...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All these scenes suddenly came to his mind. His heart was surging with fury, and he narrowed his eyes. He suddenly asked loudly, "Mr. Schneier, do you trust me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fermin asked, "What do you want to do?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's eyes were bright, and he replied firmly, "For some reason, I have no signs of being poisoned. I'm willing to defend the camp with these non-poisoned soldiers, and you can lead the rest of the troops to retreat."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But you..." Fermin hesitated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander stood up with a calm face and a faint smile, saying, "Mr. Schneier, it's no pity to die in the defense of the country!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fermin suddenly stood up and laughed, "Good! Alexander, I haven't misjudged you. You're a young hero, the backbone of our nation."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Enoch and Hogan looked at each other and pleaded firmly, "Dad, we're not poisoned either. We're willing to fight to the death with Alexander!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fermin looked at the three of them with tears in his eyes. He raised the military order with both hands and said, "I will definitely request merits for you from the emperor, build a monument for you, and let your names be remembered through the ages."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing this, Sellers couldn't help but sob.</span></p><div class="pagination">
