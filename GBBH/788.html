  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>All the wizards were terrified. They were good at witchcraft and killed people without hesitation, but most of them could not stop bullets.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yvonne's heart was even more shocked. She thought, "Master is powerful and has a strong influence."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Representatives of the Mafia and the Sakra Society were all dragged out. No matter how they wailed or struggled for mercy, it was of no use.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Several gunshots were heard outside the hall, and the representatives of the Mafia and Sakra Society fell silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yvonne said respectfully to Alexander, "Master, I will always be your slave."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Okay."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander demonstrated his power and shocked the wizards present once again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"From now on, you will rule the City of Sorcery."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander's casual words made Yvonne so excited that she burst into tears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although she was mentally prepared, when it came to realizing her ambition, she wished she could give her life to Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I swear that I am willing to sacrifice my life for you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yvonne's words were full of respect, and she looked very solemn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It moved all the wizards and bigwigs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander nodded at Yvonne, then glanced around and said murderously, "You can choose to be loyal to Monica and go to hell with her. If you want to live, surrender to me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Just as he finished speaking, the sound of bullets being loaded was heard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Shadow brought hundreds of strongmen, roaring in unison with overwhelming momentum.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The robust and murderous aura was invisible, but it made people tremble with fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although many wizards were good at witchcraft, their bodies were still those of ordinary people. How could they withstand such intimidation? They trembled in fear immediately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After the first person surrendered, instantly, many surrendered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I've long since grown tired of Monica. I'm willing to surrender!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Yes, I am willing to surrender, too. I don't want to die yet. Please don't shoot me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Among the hundreds of wizards, at least half of them begged for mercy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The other half were also terrified and retreated one after another, with some surrendering.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the end, only about a quarter of the wizards were left. Although they looked terrible, they still stared at Alexander with ferocious expressions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>These people were die-hard fans of Monica and Rock. There were hundreds of them, and they wanted to unite and fight to the death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A middle-aged wizard, Wade &zwnj;Stan&zwnj;, in a black robe, stood out. There was a terrible scar on his face, extending from his forehead to the corner of his mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Wade pointed at Alexander and shouted angrily, "Don't be so arrogant! Today is the centenary celebration of the City of Sorcery. You will never be allowed to be so presumptuous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Don't be afraid, everyone. We have a lot of people, and we are good at witchcraft. Are you worried that we can't defeat this bunch of rubbish?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'm willing to lead you and fight them together!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Wade thought he was powerful and as ambitious as Yvonne. He was unwilling to see the City of Sorcery fall into Alexander's hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After hearing Wade's encouragement, many wizards, who had already retreated, began to hesitate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They looked at each other, feeling that they could not give in, and their eyes became fierce again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander smiled disdainfully and waved his hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Kill him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Shadow appeared beside Wade like lightning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He was initially an expert in fighting. With the help of Alexander, he had taken several power elixirs and now possessed Level 2 freezing power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A frigid air appeared and struck Wade.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Wade wanted to fight back with witchcraft. But his body was frozen, and he couldn't move. Even his eyebrows and hair were covered with icy frost.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The next second, Wade was frozen into an ice sculpture and shattered by Shadow's palm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Wade's body parts were wrapped in solid ice and scattered all over the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hundreds of strongmen brought by Shadow rushed over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In close combat, they had an absolute advantage. The wizards were killed one after another before they could even cast their witchcraft.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was like a pack of lions rushing into a flock of sheep and killing them wantonly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>There were constant screams, bodies falling to the ground, and blood splattering everywhere.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>More and more wizards were frightened and quickly showed their submission.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Once Shadow saw those surrendering, he just walked around them without killing them. Suddenly, more and more wizards surrendered.</span></p><div class="pagination">
