  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ms. Lawson, this is my birthday gift to you. I hope you have a wonderful birthday," Alexander said with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Thank you, Alexander. I really appreciate it!" Grace replied, blushing as she accepted the necklace and signaled for Alexander to help her put it on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander obliged, fastening the necklace around her neck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Their closeness appeared quite intimate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The room fell silent as onlookers cast pitying glances at Asher.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He had previously boasted about being Grace's fianc&eacute;, only to embarrass himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ave's expression darkened. As a mother, she understood that a woman allowing a man to put a necklace on her in public likely had feelings for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Son of a bitch!" Asher shouted in anger, throwing the gift to the ground with a ferocious expression on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What happened? What are you guys doing?" Gavin and Gale stepped out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Behind him was a group of imposing figures, including the governor, the mayor, several generals, and diplomats. Each of them is a high-ranking powerhouse with an imposing presence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne, you're here," Gavin said, greeting Alexander with a warm smile and a firm handshake.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Asher's eyes brightened. He thought, "If I could heal Mr. Gavin Lawson, I'll regain control."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He said, "Mr. Gavin Lawson, Alexander is a fraud. Let me treat your injuries first, and then I'll deal with him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gavin frowned, aware that Alexander was formidable and Asher's arrogance was misplaced.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander replied calmly, "Do you think you can heal Mr. Gavin Lawson? You're a fraud."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Furious, Asher pointed at Alexander, shouting, "You're the fraud! That necklace is fake, too. I'll expose you today.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Let's raise the stakes. If I can cure Mr. Gavin Lawson, you leave Loscity and give me the magic powder formula.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If I lose, I'll leave Loscity immediately and never return."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Asher had made up his mind to turn the tables.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone knew Gavin's injury was notoriously difficult to treat. Now, Asher wanted to increase the stakes with Alexander. It would be a good show.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander laughed derisively. "You lost before, but I'll give you a chance. Let's have a competition. If you lose, you will not only have to leave Loscity. Do you dare to bet?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Okay, I'll bet!" Asher replied confidently, convinced he had the advantage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After the two made the bet, the atmosphere on the scene became tense again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Grace felt increasingly anxious, fearing Alexander might lose.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, Asher was recognized by everyone as a genius with excellent medical skills.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Asher, are you really sure?" Gavin asked, concerned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing Gavin's words, Asher answered respectfully, "Don't worry, Mr. Gavin Lawson. I'm prepared and can cure your injuries. However, I hope to marry Grace. Our families..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before he could finish his words, Gavin interrupted him. "If you can truly heal my injuries, then we can discuss it. Otherwise, it's off the table."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Grace's anxiety peaked, her palms sweating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Alexander, you must not lose!" she silently prayed, hoping God would bless Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Asher turned to Grace with a smile. "Grace, I'll definitely cure your grandfather. Just wait to be my wife."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ave said, "Asher, I know you truly care for Grace. Regardless of the outcome, she should be with you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mom, what are you saying? I won't agree," Grace firmly refused, "My marriage is my own decision, and I don't believe he can cure Grandpa's injury."</span></p><div class="pagination">
