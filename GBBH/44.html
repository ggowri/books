  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The two security guards couldn't help but swallow hard as they watched the woman's enticing curves sway back and forth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Damn, what a knockout! Smokin' hot body, dressed to kill, and loaded to boot. Bet she's some bigwig's arm candy," one guard muttered greedily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His partner immediately hissed, "Shut your trap! That's Ms. Rowe from the Brilliant Group. You got a death wish or something?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At the mention of the Brilliant Group, the loudmouth's face turned ashen.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The pair didn't dare look any longer and scurried off like scolded dogs.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just then, Alexander emerged from the shadows beneath a large tree, his eyes cold as he watched Betty's retreating figure.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What the..." he muttered, his brow furrowing in surprise as he spotted two burly men crouching by the back door of the villa.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As soon as Betty entered, they slipped inside like thieves in the night.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander was confident Betty was in trouble. Without a sound, he crept towards the back entrance and slipped into the mansion after them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He moved like a hunting civet, his footsteps silent as a ghost as he trailed the two brutes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Soon, Alexander heard a startled cry from the upstairs bedroom, followed by sounds of struggle and pleas for help.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But those quickly gave way to a woman's whimpers. Clearly, Betty had been subdued.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander pondered for a moment, then boldly pushed open the door.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Hearing it open, a bald man with bulging eyes burst out of the main bedroom, staring at Alexander in shock.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Who the hell are you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He hastily drew his gun, aiming it at Alexander.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His partner rushed out, too, freezing at the sight of Alexander.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Kid, are you with the Brilliant Group?" the baldie snarled, his eyes glinting with murderous intent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'm not with the Brilliant Group. Hand over Betty, and I'll leave. We'll pretend this never happened."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander stated matter-of-factly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Baldie sized Alexander up contemptuously, waving the gun at his forehead.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Listen, punk, you're this bitch's boy toy, right? I'm calling the shots here. One bullet and your brains paint the wall. Do you still want to act tough?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander seemed oblivious to the gun barrel in his face. His voice was ice cold.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You've got thirty seconds to get the fuck out of here."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander was confident he could send the bald man to hell before the guy could even pull the trigger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You're dead!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The bald man's eyes flashed dangerously as he went to squeeze the trigger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But Alexander moved too fast. In the instant the bald man tried to act, he felt a sharp pain in his throat, and his body instantly paralyzed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">There was a crisp snap as Alexander broke the bald man's neck in one swift motion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Before the bald man's accomplice could react, a fist suddenly appeared before his eyes, expanding like lightning.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Then everything went black, and he knew no more.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander swiftly took down two men and then calmly walked into the bedroom.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Inside, he found Betty tied up on the bed, her mouth securely gagged with a towel, her hair disheveled, and her dress torn to shreds.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her long legs were fully exposed, revealing a glimpse of her pink panties at the thigh.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Hearing Alexander, Betty immediately began to struggle desperately, her muffled cries filling the room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her full, round boobs nearly burst through the tear in her dress, bouncing enticingly like a pair of rabbits, incredibly tempting.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander couldn't help but admire Betty's enticing figure for a moment before he removed the gag from her mouth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Betty let out a long sigh, her expression softening noticeably.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She stammered, "You... you're not with The Kaylon?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander cocked his head to the side.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"The Kaylon? Nope, not me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Betty's eyes suddenly lit up with delight.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Thank you for saving me. Please untie these ropes. I'll make it worth your while."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But Alexander seemed to ignore her plea, plopping himself down on the couch with an air of superiority, eyeing her with amusement.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Betty's heart sank. This guy might not be with The Kaylon, but he was clearly bad news.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She remained composed, feigning a delicate pout as she said, "You're a hero who helps those in need, shouldn't you untie me first?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As Betty laid on the charm, she batted her eyelashes at Alexander and purposefully pushed out her chest.</p><div class="pagination">
