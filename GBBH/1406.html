  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, countless dazzling silver-white light-columns burst out, enveloping Frieza like an inescapable net.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Frieza widened his triangular, slanting eyes. Just as he was about to move, he was already hit. These light columns hit his body, with continuous thumping sounds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, Frieza endured countless blows. Amid the thumping sounds, the dazzling light columns gradually merged, growing larger and larger. With a bang, a huge and dazzling light flashed, submerging Frieza.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What a powerful internal energy! Meteor Fist! This is..." Alexander's eyes almost popped out, and his mouth opened wide.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander thought, "I can't run away. This beauty looks strong. I'd better find a place to adjust my internal energy and heal the wounds as soon as possible."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey, beauty! I'll leave this battle to you. I'm going to heal my injuries." Alexander greeted Erica with a playful smile and rushed to a complete stone house in the village.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing that greeting, Erica couldn't help but feel speechless. She frowned, and her attack became even more fierce.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The green smoke in the air gradually dissipated, and Frieza's figure slowly appeared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His head was slightly lowered, and his arms crossed in front of his face. His combat power detector was broken, and there were bruises on his body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Frieza glared at Erica, a fierce glint flashing in his narrow eyes. He sneered, "Your combat power is over 100 thousand. Go to hell!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Scarlet flames burst out. Frieza moved and disappeared. Suddenly, he appeared behind Erica. His thick and short arm, ablaze with red flames, punched straight at Erica's back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Erica shouted, and in a split second, she soared into the air. An extremely dazzling and holy light shone. Her clear voice rang out. "Comet Fist!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Countless bright light columns suddenly converged on Erica's right fist. A huge, dazzling silver-white comet appeared, trailing a long tail of flames. In an instant, it smashed into Frieza's head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a bang, a huge light explosion flashed, and a large pit was left on the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Frieza was lying face-down, with his limbs spread out, in the pit. His strange body twitched slightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the stone house in the village, Alexander was practicing his internal energy to heal his injuries. He suddenly frowned. Erica's aura had increased again, and Frieza seemed to have weakened a little bit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Frieza coughed and jumped up. His striped battle armor had broken, and there was a trace of blood at the corner of his mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Not bad! I can really have much fun today." Frieza took a horse-riding stance, raised his arms, and clenched his ape-like palms. He stared at Erica with his triangular, bloodshot eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Frieza suddenly let out a painful scream. With a crack, the striped battle armor on his body cracked, and pieces of it fell off. The brass battle boots exploded with a bang.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A pair of large three-toed feet like an ostrich's appeared. It seemed that something was about to break out from the buttocks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Frieza's screams became even more miserable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The ground seemed to start shaking. Fallen leaves, branches, and gravel, defying the laws of gravity, began to rise slowly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander suddenly opened his eyes in the stone house, filled with horror. He thought, "Frieza's internal energy seems to be slowly approaching the weakest internal energy in the Dominion Church's meditation hall. It's extremely powerful!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Erica's delicate face turned cold, her blue eyes showing unwavering determination. She shouted, "Devil, you must die today!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She clenched her fists and struck out suddenly. Countless dazzling light columns burst out, and the bright light explosion submerged Frieza.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the smoke gradually dissipated, Erica let out a long sigh of relief. Even a mountain would have been flattened by her strike. That devil...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, a thick, scarlet whip-like shadow whipped Erica away, smashing her straight into a pile of rocks by the roadside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Erica spat out a mouthful of blood, pressed her hands on the ground, and soared into the air. She did a series of beautiful somersaults in the air and landed in the distance. Taking a closer look, she thought that devil was definitely a high-level member of the Devil Cult, extremely thoroughly demonized.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Frieza was only the size of a little child. His helmet had disappeared, and two thick, black, and ferocious spikes on the side of his head appeared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Frieza had a large square face and a pair of triangular, slanting white eyes. His strange, narrow pupils were full of cruelty and cunning. His hands were like ape claws, and his feet were like an ostrich's three-toed feet. His body was covered with dark-red horizontal stripes, and behind him, a huge tail like a python was swaying slowly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Erica stroked her waist. It was that tail that had just hit her.</span></p><div class="pagination">
