  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The club erupted with relief, the pallor on their faces giving way to a hint of color.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A group of men in black trench coats, flanking a bald, stern man, marched in. It was Kellen Hunter, the head of the Hunter family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as he saw Norma, his face twisted in anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His son, Matteo, had been left crippled after a run-in with her at the docks. The grudge had burned in him ever since.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Behind Kellen, four massive men dressed in traditional samurai garb stood, their weathered hands and tense postures revealing they were more than just show.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hunter! Help us!" the bartender cried out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Kellen could respond, Alexander grabbed the man by the throat and lifted him effortlessly off the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The bartender struggled, desperately trying to pry Alexander's fingers loose, but his efforts were futile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hunter... help..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He weakly reached out toward Kellen, desperately pleading for help.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kellen's face reddened with rage. "Let him go! Or I'll kill you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander merely tightened his grip, snapping the bartender's neck with a sickening crack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The bartender's body convulsed briefly before falling limp</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a flick of his wrist, Alexander tossed the lifeless man at Kellen's feet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Too much," Alexander said coldly. "You may intimidate others, but not me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kellen's face contorted with murderous intent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He glanced around, his confidence bolstered by the sheer number of his men.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His fierce, predatory glares zeroed in on Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get him! Kill him!" Kellen barked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The four </span><span>Risun</span><span> samurai charged forward, moving like predators closing in on their prey.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander didn't flinch. He struck first.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His </span><span>fist</span><span> collided with the chest of the first samurai, the sound of bones shattering echoing in the room as the man was sent flying, his body slamming into the far wall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before the second and third could react, Alexander appeared between them, his hands snapping their heads together with a brutal crack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blood and brains splattered as their lifeless bodies hit the floor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The last samurai froze in terror.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He turned to flee, but Alexander's kick sent him crashing into the wall with bone-crushing force, the room shaking with the impact.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, Kellen's elite warriors were nothing more than broken corpses, and the man who had once been so confident now stood shaking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One of his subordinates whispered nervously, "Sir, should we fight?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shut up!" Kellen snapped, slapping the man aside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, turning to the rest of his men, he admitted, "We're done. This man is too strong. We can't take him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he turned to flee, Alexander's voice rang out coldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Going somewhere? I didn't give you permission to leave."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kellen turned back, his voice trembling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What do you want? I still have men. Are you really ready to die over this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's backhand sent Kellen stumbling, his head spinning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His men stood frozen, unsure whether to jump in or back off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Norma, watching the scene unfold, felt a deep admiration for Alexander. He had </span><span>single-handedly put down Kellen and his entire crew.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No one leaves," Alexander said firmly, his grip tightening on Kellen's collar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Take me to Base One."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kellen hesitated before a twisted grin spread across his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fine, I'll take you there. But you're walking straight into your grave. Don't say I didn't warn you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Base One was the most fortified and secretive stronghold of the Sakra Society.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was walking straight into their hands, and Kellen was thrilled about it.</span></p><div class="pagination">
