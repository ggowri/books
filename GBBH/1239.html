  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even facing the terrifying beast tide, his eyes remained locked on Alexander with unwavering loyalty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander wasn't just his boss&mdash;he was his mentor, his guiding light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Alexander gave an order, Augusta would give his life to complete the mission, no questions asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Take half our people and provide covering fire," Alexander instructed. "You can fall back when things get hot, but keeping everyone safe is your top priority. Remember. We can't afford to lose any people or supplies."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, sir!" Augusta replied with conviction. "I promise you won't see a single loss."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without another word, Augusta started setting up defensive positions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What about me, Alexander?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marvin was practically bouncing with excitement, eager to jump into action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Facing the terrifying beast tide, Marvin didn't show a hint of hesitation or fear. Instead, the approaching danger only fired him up more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fighting was in his blood, and his fire power only amplified his hot-headed nature.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He'd always felt like he owed Alexander big time, and he was ready to pay that debt with his life if necessary.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now that the crucial moment had arrived, Marvin stared down the monsters with nothing but pure battle lust coursing through his veins.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes locked onto Alexander, practically begging for a challenging assignment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Take the other half and run interference," Alexander commanded. "Hit them as hard as you can, but don't get bogged down. Stay in sync with Augusta at all times."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, Alexander barked another order, "William, Logan, you two follow me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, sir!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>William and Logan's voices boomed in unison. They shot Marvin a smug look. Fighting side by side with Alexander was the highest honor they could imagine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marvin just snorted, throwing them both a </span><span>sharp</span><span> look.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>William was decked out in custom combat gear with an exoskeleton suit. As a level-four firearms specialist, he could handle pretty much any weapon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His loadout was intense&mdash;a sniper rifle, an assault rifle, two handguns, and enough grenades to start a party. He was a walking arsenal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Plus, William had awakened vampire bloodline, giving him some crazy healing abilities. That was why Alexander had picked him over Marvin for this gig.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Logan was a different story. As a level-four speed power metahuman, he traveled light, with just an assault rifle, a handgun, and a few grenades. His real weapons of choice were two custom-made machetes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The pair of machetes weren't crafted by any famous blacksmith&mdash;they were forged from top-grade special steel instead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They might not have been razor-sharp, but damn, they packed one hell of a punch with their weight and raw power!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You'll need to stay mobile during the fight," Alexander continued. "Keep your distance from those mutant beasts and create openings for us three.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And don't worry if we get surrounded. We can handle ourselves and break free if needed."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's tone was dead serious as he briefed Augusta and Marvin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, sir!" The response came back loud and clear from everyone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The hundred elite members of the Ultimate Alliance showed no fear. Their eyes were filled with absolute trust and admiration for Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They knew in their hearts that if the monsters surrounded any of them, Alexander would fight through hell itself to save them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thought of just three people facing that tidal wave of monsters got everyone's blood pumping.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, there are only three of you going up against all those monsters," Marvin pressed, still not convinced. "Isn't that cutting it too thin? Want me to back you up?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were up against thousands of horrifying mutant beasts. Even with backup on the perimeter and defenders in the church, the risk was still astronomical.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One wrong move, and the three of them, including Alexander, might never make it back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Cut the crap," Alexander snapped. "Focus on your job and move out."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Alexander's mind was made up, Marvin knew there was no point arguing. He quickly gathered his half of the force and got their twenty heavy trucks rolling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They should have reached Louvian Port hours ago, but modifying the trucks had eaten up precious time. Still, each soldier was armed to the teeth with dozens of grenade launchers, mortars, and heavy machine guns.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their numbers might be small, but their firepower packed one hell of a punch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Everyone get ready!" Augusta shouted. He had positioned his half of the force strategically, with all their heavy weapons locked and loaded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Alexander gave the signal, Augusta roared, "Light 'em up!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thunderous explosions of mortar shells rocked the sky.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Heavy machine gun fire rained down like a deadly storm, pummeling the dense horde of mutant beasts.</span></p><div class="pagination">
