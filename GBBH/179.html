  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gary growled, his voice dripping with menace, "Listen up, kid. People from the Federer family can't just die without consequences. You either hand over the magic powder formula as atonement, or you'll have a lot to regret."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander chuckled, unfazed. "I'm curious to see the consequences you mentioned."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gary continued, puffing himself up with self-importance. "Don't kid yourself. Just because you have the magic powder doesn't mean you can stand up to the Federer family. We've been around for centuries, standing strong with roots so deep you can't even begin to fathom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even if Ava wants to help you, she's just a CEO. I guarantee the chairman of the Saint Group won't let her run wild.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm giving you one last chance. Hand over the formula and sever your own hands, and then maybe, just maybe, I'll let you off the hook."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander </span><span>smirked,</span><span> his disdain evident. "Why would I give you anything?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anyone can throw around threats. The </span><span>formula's</span><span> in my head, and here I am. Come and take it if you can."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gary snapped, "Trust me, I will take it. If I set my sights on something, you're going to hand it over."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get lost! You're shameless."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander spat, a glob of spit landing at Gary's feet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fury ignited in Gary's eyes, and his bodyguards tensed, ready to pounce. The atmosphere thickened with tension.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dominic said, "Let me teach him a lesson. Otherwise, he'll think he's invincible just because he knows a few moves."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gary waved his hand. "Dominic, break one of his hands first. That should put him in his place."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Understood," Dominic replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A sinister smile crept across his face as he approached Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander. I've heard you dabble in sorcery and that you're some kind of combat prodigy. But at your age, I doubt you're anything special. Dealing with </span><span>Houtte's</span><span> ambush? I bet the Saint Group had a hand in it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You knew about the ambush beforehand and set up a counter-ambush, didn't you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dominic beamed with self-satisfaction, convinced he had it all figured out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander chuckled derisively. "You really are a foolish old man."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dominic's eyes flashed with malice. "Am I wrong?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Houtte</span><span> brought over fifty men, and you thought you could take them all on by yourself? Even a fool could guess the Saint Group was involved."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander waved his hand dismissively. "Enough with the chatter. If you want to fight, let's get on with it. I don't have all day to waste on you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dominic </span><span>laughed,</span><span> a harsh sound filled with scorn. "You really don't know what you're in for, do you? Let me show you what real skill looks like.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"True skills come from hard work and sweat, honed over decades of practice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How old are you? I started training at four, and I've been at it for sixty years. Even if you'd been practicing since you were born, you'd never catch up to me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he boasted, Dominic closed the distance between them, his presence growing more imposing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The air around him crackled with an unseen force, far more intimidating than Joseph or </span><span>Houtte</span><span> had ever been.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander could sense a subtle energy radiating from Dominic. Though it wasn't nearly as powerful as his own Force, it was unmistakably the aura of a top-tier expert.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What had initially been a lackluster encounter now sparked Alexander's interest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I could be your grandfather, and you think you can take me down?" Dominic roared, straightening his previously hunched form and transforming into a towering figure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The invisible pressure he exuded intensified like a mountain bearing down on Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caught off guard, Alexander thought to himself, "So he really is a top-tier fighter. He's managing to harness a powerful energy. This is going to be interesting."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Alexander remain silent, as if paralyzed with fear, Dominic burst into laughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Watch closely, kid!" he taunted, stepping forward and slamming his palm down towards Alexander's shoulder, intending to force Alexander down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unflinching, Alexander met the aggression head-on, his own palm thrust out to clash against Dominic's.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a resounding explosion of air, the force of their collision sent Dominic staggering backward, nearly toppling over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Impossible!" Dominic and Gary gasped in </span><span>unison,</span><span> their faces etched with shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander scoffed disdainfully. "Is that all you've got? Trying to teach me a lesson with moves like that?"</span></p><div class="pagination">
