  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the morning sun rose, a thunderous roar erupted across the island, echoing like a detonation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A dozen agile figures charged toward the headquarters of the Red Umbrella Group, ruthlessly taking down its members in their path.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These were the elite fighters under Shadow, clad in combat armor, serving as the vanguard assault team.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The decisive battle was finally about to begin!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Combat armor is truly extraordinary; each of them is stronger than I am!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosalia exclaimed, her beautiful eyes wide with shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fortunately, this type of combat armor is still difficult to mass-produce; it's so rare that even the Red Umbrella Group doesn't possess any."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Charlize was also taken aback; the scene before her completely overturned her worldview.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If this combat armor became widely available, ordinary humans could leap into power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just imagine how formidable skilled fighters like them would become with this armor!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They could probably tear through a tiger with ease!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And he believed that with the ongoing advancements in technology, there would surely come a day when combat armor could be produced the masse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander chuckled to himself; not only was he unbothered by this basic combat armor, but even the more advanced suits from science fiction didn't intimidate him. He could cut through them effortlessly with a single swing of his sword.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't rush into action but calmly observed the battlefield.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The dozen elite fighters in combat armor moved swiftly and struck hard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, with Alexander's All-seeing Eyes, he could effortlessly lock onto them, tracing their movements and identifying their weaknesses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Immediately, dozens, even hundreds, of effective attack strategies flashed through his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Alexander grew stronger, his All-seeing Eyes operated like an omniscient system, adept at grasping the changes on the battlefield and making optimal decisions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if the Red Umbrella Group had combat armor, Alexander wouldn't need to lift a finger. He could unleash the Force and, using the All-seeing Eyes and the Force, easily control the minds of the wearers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, even if Alexander could control the enemies, he couldn't seize the combat armor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This high-tech product wasn't solely controlled by the wearer; it also responded to commands from the central control room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, even if Alexander could dominate the wearers, the central control room would trigger self-destruct mechanisms on the armor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The vanguard team dispatched by Shadow, enhanced by their combat armor, was unstoppable, wreaking havoc everywhere.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We're currently in a favorable position; the Red Umbrella Group hasn't made any significant moves yet. Let's flank them from another direction for a two-pronged attack."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander initiated the pre-arranged battle plan as he led Rosalia and Charlize toward a nearby building.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was the hideout of Augusta, William, and five hundred elite members of the Ultimate Alliance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Originally a small force affiliated with the Red Umbrella Group, this location lay on the eastern side, close to the Group's stronghold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the leader of this faction had already been subdued by Augusta, allowing them to remain undetected and poised for a surprise attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop! Who are you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Alexander, Rosalia, and Charlize reached the halfway point, they were suddenly confronted by members of the Red Umbrella Group, led by a man clad in a full black battle exoskeleton.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His exoskeleton was simpler and more rudimentary compared to the combat armor, clearly a notch below in technology.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, it still significantly enhanced strength and speed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even ordinary fighters equipped with this low-tier exoskeleton could see a substantial boost in their combat effectiveness, allowing them to contend with more powerful foes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the forefront of the Red Umbrella Group was a burly, bald Black man, his body adorned with red tattoos, resembling a monstrous figure of red and black.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you from the Brilliant Group? How dare you ambush us, the Red Umbrella Group! let's take them down!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The bald man roared, charging forward with a menacing aura.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne, I'll handle him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosalia declared confidently, stepping forward to take on the challenge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, not only the bald man but several other members of the Red Umbrella Group, fully armed, were rushing towards them, aiming to encircle Shadow's rear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Among them were several skilled fighters equipped with low-level battle </span><span>exoskeletons,</span><span> each one significantly bolstered in strength.</span></p><div class="pagination">
