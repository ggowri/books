  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The phone rang for a long time, but no one answered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thomas turned pale. Jordan was his only son.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He glared at Alexander with increasingly ferocious eyes, but the latter remained calm. In Alexander's eyes, Thomas and his kind were like slightly strong ants that could be crushed to death at will.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Carlo sneered and said, "Brat, where are you from? Do you know who I am?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander looked at him expressionlessly and said, "I don't care. Has anyone ever told you that you are good at bluffing? But unfortunately, you're bluffing at the wrong person."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Carlo slammed the table and said angrily, "If you continue to be so arrogant, I will kill your family."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander had a sarcastic expression on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Kill my family? Just because you're a member of the Mafia? Unfortunately, even your Godfather nicknamed SATAN can't do anything to me, let alone you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His words reduced Carlo's arrogance. Carlo failed to figure out who Alexander was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander looked calmly at Thomas with deep eyes and said, "You are the largest shareholder of the Silver Shield Security. Transfer all your shares to me, and I will spare your family."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thomas was shocked and angry, gritting his teeth and saying, "Brat, I don't know where you come from, but you can't steal my property. You will get yourself in big trouble without getting anything from me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As he refuted Alexander, Thomas winked at the bodyguards next to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The bodyguards surrounded them aggressively.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thomas waved his hand and roared, "Catch him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Swish.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The bodyguard who was rushing in the front took out a dagger and swung it at Alexander's back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He was a mercenary and was very confident in his sneak attack. Even if he couldn't seriously injure Alexander, he would leave a wound in the latter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The next second, a shrill scream was heard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander kicked the bodyguard in the crotch without even looking back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The bodyguard froze, his hand with the dagger shaking, his eyes bulging. He slowly fell to the ground, and the dagger clanged to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Bang. Bang."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Two loud crashing noises were heard in succession. After two bodyguards fell heavily to the ground, everyone could see that Alexander had sent them flying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone gasped. The remaining three bodyguards took several steps back in fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander's strength was beyond their imagination.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A depressing silence fell upon the room, and the temperature seemed to have dropped several degrees.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander strode forward and grabbed Carlo by the throat, lifting him up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Let go of me. Let go..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Carlo struggled desperately and tried to move Alexander's fingers away with both hands, but it was of no avail.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After a while, he kicked his legs, and foams appeared in his mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Crack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander broke Carlo's neck and threw his dead body to the ground as if he were a piece of trash.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The fingerprints on Carlo's neck were shocking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"How dare you kill a Mafia member?" Thomas exclaimed, shaking uncontrollably.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although he had bullied and beaten many people before, he did not dare to kill anyone in public.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Well, are you scared now? Weren't you arrogant just now? You wanted to kill my family?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander sneered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Run!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The bodyguards left Thomas behind and ran outside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander kicked the sofa up into the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It spun at high speed, hitting the bodyguards like a speeding train and pressing them to the ground. Each of them had a few broken bones.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Blood oozed out of their mouths, staining the floor red.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Go to hell!" Thomas said ferociously and pulled out his gun, firing fiercely at Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Bang, bang, bang."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The sharp sound of gunfire echoed in the small hall, but Alexander disappeared as if he had never come.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Help! Ah!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thomas felt a sharp pain in his wrist as Alexander shook the gun off his hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thomas roared angrily, "I'll kill you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Get on your knees," Alexander shouted and slapped Thomas on the shoulder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Crack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A crisp sound of bone cracking was heard, and Thomas was overwhelmed by the strong force and severe pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His knees went weak, and he knelt to Alexander.</span></p><div class="pagination">
