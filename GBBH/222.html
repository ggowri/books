  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julia was so angry that her face turned red.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She said in anger, "Aiden, you are so shameless!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I am not shameless, it&rsquo;s called ability. Just blame yourself for not being capable of gaining the favor of the Kaylon."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aiden looked very proud.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even if you win, so what? In this world, strength is everything. As long as the Kaylon supports me, you won't be able to do anything to me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aiden looked proud and confident and flaunted his powerful connections to the extreme.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're such a bastard!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julia was extremely angry, but she couldn't do anything about Aiden.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aiden waved his hand majestically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This farce should end now. From now on, the management rights of Gemstone Street will still belong to the Ulysses family. As for me, I will always be the head of the Ulysses family."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Julia, you have been expelled from the Ulysses family, why don't you get out now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julia was speechless. As long as the Kaylon supported Aiden, she had no way to deal with it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander laughed contemptuously and said, "So what you have the support from the Kaylon? Being supported by the Kaylon means that you can do whatever you want?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who is speaking ill of the Kaylon?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, a majestic voice sounded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone turned their heads and saw Oscar walking towards them with a group of bodyguards.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The gemstone business occupied an important position in the Kaylon. Oscar knew that there would be trouble in today's competition, so he hurried here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Aiden saw Oscar, he was overjoyed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He greeted Oscar with a smile on his face and a flattering attitude.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sir Stewart, what brings you here. Please forgive me for disturbing your peace!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Oscar asked expressionlessly, "Who framed the Kaylon just now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aiden quickly pointed at Alexander and complained angrily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's him, that bastard. He said that the Kaylon is unreasonable."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Oscar saw that it was Alexander, he was stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander said with a smile, "Sir Stewart, Aiden has lost the duel. According to the Ulysses family rules, he should give up the position of the head of the family to Julia. But he is cheating by relying on the support of the Kaylon. This is not good."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Oscar's expression suddenly changed, and he cursed, "This bastard!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aiden thought that Oscar was scolding Alexander and was immediately overjoyed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's right. He is a bastard. He deserves to die...Ah!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before he could finish his words, he was slapped hard by Oscar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aiden staggered a few steps, covering his burning cheek, and looked at Oscar in horror.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sir Stewart, why did you hit me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Oscar slapped him again, making him dizzy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You are so disrespectful to Mr. </span><span>Hawthorne,</span><span> you deserve to die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, the whole audience was in an uproar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The few people who knew Alexander kept shaking their heads, knowing that Aiden had offended a big shot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smiled and shook hands with Oscar, then introduced Julia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Oscar had met Julia a long time ago and had always had a good impression of her, so he immediately agreed to support Julia in becoming the head of the Ulysses family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He still had to rely on Alexander for treatment, so he didn't dare to offend Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, those who were against Alexander, like Sebastian and Evan from the Tate family, Joseph and </span><span>Houtte</span><span> from the Cripples, and David, all disappeared, and none of them had a good ending.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Oscar, who was cunning, had long listed Alexander as a big shot who he had to flatter but not offend.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was just following the trend to support Julia to become the head of the Ulysses family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this time, Angelica shouted unwillingly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why did you hit my father? You are so shameless, have you colluded to take my father's position as the head of the family?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aiden was so frightened that he almost fainted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hurriedly shouted at her, "Angelica, stop talking!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angelica was still unconvinced and said, "What I said is all true. How could they take your position as the head of the family? Are the people of the Kaylon more noble?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aiden wished he could kick Angelica to death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shut up!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He raised his hand and slapped Angelica hard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm sorry, Sir Stewart, please forgive us. My daughter is unruly and headstrong, I will definitely discipline her. I will give the position of head of the family to Julia."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Oscar snorted and said, "Aiden, you will be killed by your daughter sooner or later."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aiden was covered in cold sweat and his face was pale. He could only nod and bow to apologize.</span></p><div class="pagination">
