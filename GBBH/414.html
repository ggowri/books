  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane was with Simon today, and she kept trying to take Ashley away. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander had a nagging suspicion that the Red Umbrella Group's schemes involved Ashley somehow. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He felt a surge of anger as he paced in his study. Ashley was his Achilles' heel, and if the Red Umbrella Group dared to threaten her, Alexander vowed that Felix would pay the price.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wondered how Augusta and William were faring on Treasure Island. Driving the Red Umbrella Group out of there would deal a significant blow to Felix.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the northern part of Treasure Island, the streets were strewn with garbage and the streetlights were few, a stark contrast to the bright, bustling south. The north, controlled by the Red Umbrella Group, remained unchanged. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But since Guzman's death, the south had transformed into a thriving urban area. Cloe had even organized a vigilante patrol to clean up the chaos, setting the south on a path of rapid development.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the deep darkness, a man moved swiftly. He was sturdy, moving with the speed of the wind, barely visible in the dim light. This was Augusta, the captain of the security patrol, with William as his vice-captain. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>William handled the patrols, while Augusta lurked in the shadows, dispensing justice where needed. They had both become more powerful after taking the second power elixir.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Augusta's strength had more than doubled, and his speed and reflexes were unmatched compared to a few months ago.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I wonder how Mr. Hawthorne is doing in </span><span>Loscity</span><span>, and Marvin and Charlize... I hope Charlize stays out of trouble... I miss them," Augusta mused in the shadows, his sharp eyes fixed on the Red Umbrella Group's building.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The south's security had improved significantly, and they had adapted well to life on Treasure Island. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tonight, Augusta planned to take the next step in his mission to make the Red Umbrella Group feel the pressure, aiming to demoralize and ultimately expel them from the island.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, several men emerged from the Red Umbrella Group's building. There was a bald man, a burly guy, a skinny one, and a man covered in tattoos&mdash;four in total, all armed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These men were members of the Red Umbrella Group, fresh from collecting their pay and new potions. The bald man exclaimed, "This is great! We each got hundreds of thousands of dollars and Level 2 power elixir. Even diluted, it boosts my strength!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The skinny man nodded in agreement. "Yeah, they say Level 2 has no side effects. If we keep taking it, we might develop special abilities."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Too bad it's diluted and still has some side effects, so we can only use it once every two weeks," another added, as they chatted excitedly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Augusta perked up at this. "Four guys with their pay and diluted Level 2 elixir. Perfect."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had already managed to get some of this elixir from them before. It stabilized their </span><span>power and even slightly increased their strength and speed. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for the warnings about side effects, Augusta suspected the Red Umbrella Group's leaders might have been lying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The four men, feeling relaxed in their territory, were oblivious to Augusta shadowing them. As they passed through a dark alley, Augusta quietly appeared behind them. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, William and a few others blocked their path ahead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who are you guys with?" the bald man asked casually, assuming everyone there belonged to the Red Umbrella Group.</span></p><div class="pagination">
