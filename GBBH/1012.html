  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ah!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Windwolf screamed in agony as Alexander grabbed his arms and snapped them with a twist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In a blur of movement, Alexander's fingers locked onto the throats of Windwolf's two companions like an eagle's claws.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Two sounds of breaking necks echoed simultaneously. The two metahumans crumpled to the ground, their lifeless bodies slumping like discarded bags.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Windwolf roared in fury, still unwilling to accept defeat. He kicked toward Alexander, forcing himself through the pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Alexander was faster. The moment Windwolf's foot moved, Alexander grabbed his leg, twisting it with a brutal grip. Then, he hammered his fist into Windwolf's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With a shrill scream, Windwolf fell to the ground, half his face swollen, his hands twisted and broken. He howled in agony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander placed his foot on Windwolf's chest, his voice cold and merciless. "To me, taking your life is no greater task than squashing an ant."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone froze, a chill running down their spine. Alexander's overwhelming aura paralyzed them with fear, making them unable to move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Asher's gaze was fixed on Windwolf, who was still writhing beneath Alexander's boot, blood pouring from his mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His face was full of disbelief and shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He was shocked that the three metahumans had teamed up, and yet they were easily defeated in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Asher was drenched in cold sweat, his clothes soaked through.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He had always prided himself on being the top young genius, but now, he realized he was nothing compared to Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He had known Alexander was strong, but he had always believed that he could defeat him. He'd never taken Alexander seriously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Now, he realized how wrong he had been.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander was far stronger than any of the intel had suggested. He was at a level of power that was almost terrifying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Windwolf and his companions had failed, and now an even greater number of members of the Ultimate Alliance were surrounding them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>These people were nothing like Betty's subordinates. Each of them radiated a chilling and murderous aura, and none of them were any weaker than Windwolf and his crew.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They stood there, their chilling and murderous glares focused on Asher. Just their presence was enough to send waves of fear through him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"It's over! We're surrounded!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Asher's face turned ashen, his eyes wide with terror.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He wanted to take down Alexander, but he had no confidence left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Asher swallowed hard, his legs trembling uncontrollably. His eyes filled with pure and unmasked fear as he looked at Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Betty knew Alexander was strong, but she hadn't seen him fight in a long time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The average members of the Ultimate Alliance had never witnessed his true power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>What had just happened was beyond their wildest imagination. They didn't expect that Alexander had become a force so terrifying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The three metahumans had been taken down in the blink of an eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Alexander, dare you to kill members of the Vance family?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Asher screamed, though he tried to be brave, his voice full of desperation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He wasn't begging for mercy. He knew this was a fight to the death, and if he was going to survive, he had no choice but to gamble everything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He yelled at his subordinates, "Go! Kill them all! I'll reward 200 thousand dollars for a kill!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Kill Alexander, and you'll get 100 million dollars. Plus, you'll become a senior manager in the Vance family. You'll enjoy the family's annual dividends!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Asher wasn't just a tough character. He knew how to use money and power to his advantage. At a moment like this, he didn't hesitate to offer his subordinates hefty rewards.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>For money and power, people would do anything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The atmosphere instantly became charged. His previously deflated subordinates, fueled by greed, suddenly came alive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Now, they only had one goal, which was to kill for money and maybe rise to the top of the Vance family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They were all ready to gamble with their lives.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'm going to kill him. Don't you dare get in my way!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>One of the men charged forward, exploding with fury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The group howled like wolves, some readying their guns, others brandishing knives, charging wildly at Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gunfire erupted, the flames from the muzzles lighting up the scene!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Blades gleamed in the air!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>All the Vance family's attacks were now focused solely on Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>These men, carefully picked by Asher, were elite warriors. Although they didn't have metahuman abilities, their skills were top-notch. They had killed someone before and weren't afraid of violence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Blinded by greed, they attacked like wild animals, their ferocity terrifying.</span></p><div class="pagination">
