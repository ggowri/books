  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The office was eerily silent. And the atmosphere was heavy with tension.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ava, noticing Malakai's continued silence, steeled herself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Valdez, if you insist on going down this path, I'm afraid the other shareholders of the Nexura Group won't agree, will they?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Malakai sighed quietly, his tone resigned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ms. Blackburn, there's nothing I can do. From today, the Nexura Group is ending its cooperation with you. We will no longer supply you with materials.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'm here just to say goodbye and hope to reach some understanding."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With that, Malakai stood up, ready to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Valdez, I can raise the price of all the materials by ten percent. How about that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ava continued, trying to persuade him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"No. This is a matter of my family's safety. No amount of money will change my mind."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Malakai shook his head firmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"How about a thirty percent increase?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ava gritted her teeth, pushing harder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"No!" Malakai's voice was resolute. "I've already said, no matter what you offer, we will not supply any more materials. I hope you can understand, Ms. Blackburn, there are reasons I can't explain."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His face was a mask of indifference, unaffected by the financial offer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As he made for the door, Ava suddenly called out to him, "Mr. Valdez, do you recognize this ring? Someone asked me to give it to you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Malakai, who had already turned away, froze when his eyes caught the sight of the ring on Ava's finger. His face went pale.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ramona, who was almost at the door, heard his shout, "Wait!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She turned, only to see Malakai staring intently at Ava's ring, his expression one of shock and disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ramona asked with confuse, "What's going on? What happened?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Don't speak!" Malakai snapped, startling both Ramona and the bodyguards.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He was visibly shaken now, his eyes fixed on the ring. His voice trembled as he asked, "Could you take it off? Can you let me see it closely?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Malakai's sudden politeness was startling as if he had just encountered something sacred. Ramona was left completely dumbfounded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ava felt a surge of triumph, thinking, "This ring really worked. Godfather is a genius." Seeing Malakai's reaction to the ring, she realized that Malakai and Godfather shared a deep connection.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Valdez, take a good look. This ring belonged to the founder of the Brilliant Group, known as 'Reaper,' the Godfather himself. He asked me to deliver it to you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As she explained, Ava passed the ring to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Reaper... Godfather? Could it be that the one from back then...?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Malakai's heart raced as he quickly took the ring with both hands, treating it with reverence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone else exchanged puzzled glances.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With the immense power of the Nexura Group, they had no reason to fear a gangster like the Godfather.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yet, Malakai treated this ring with the utmost respect, as if he were a devout believer encountering the object of his faith.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Malakai paid no attention to the others and carefully examined the ring, his fingers tracing its patterns and the gemstone on it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"It's really my great-grandfather's ring!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His voice was barely above a whisper, his face etched with confusion and disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Beads of sweat covered his forehead, and his face looked as if he had seen a ghost.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ava and everyone else froze in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ramona, shaking, grabbed Malakai's arm, her voice trembling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Malakai, are you sure this is your great-grandfather's ring? Are you sure you're not mistaken?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Absolutely not. The material, the design, the patterns... they're all a perfect match. Even the gemstone is exactly like the one my father described."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Back then, my great-grandfather led our family to escape a band of robbers. If it weren't for a mysterious benefactor stepping in, we would have all been killed."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"To show his gratitude, my great-grandfather gave this precious gemstone ring to our savior, the person who helped the Valdez family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"My great-grandfather swore that anyone who brought this ring could command the Valdez family to do one thing unconditionally."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Malakai spoke with trembling hands, his face shifting between joy and deep, anxious concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ms. Blackburn, I never expected that our family's benefactor would turn out to be the Godfather. If it weren't for his help all those years ago, the Valdez family would have been wiped out."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ava smiled faintly. "So, does this mean you're willing to resume the material supply?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Malakai sighed deeply, his face filled with uncertainty.</span></p><div class="pagination">
