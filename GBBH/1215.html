  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They possessed power; they were the future of mankind. Of course, their status was far higher than that of ordinary people; it was a kind of pride based on their own strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But today, when they met Alexander, who had no power aura at all, they changed their views.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a suite inside the base, the naked Alexander was sitting on the edge of a large bed, his legs split to both sides, with a cup of cola in his left hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He savored the cola while gazing intently at the surveillance display screen not far in front of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What appeared on the screen was the scene of the training hall at the moment, in which dozens of players were training.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And kneeling between Alexander's legs was a beautiful woman with white skin, plump buttocks, and brown hair that was soft and shiny, precisely Brittany.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her delicate red lips tightly banded around the man's body. It could be seen that she was very attentive; the top had been covered with her shiny saliva, which from time to time issued a "chirp" sound.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Brittany had already served Alexander for more than ten minutes, Alexander was not at all unable to hold on like ordinary men.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His attention was focused on the monitor screen, understanding the strength of the action team members.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brittany was a bit anxious now, afraid that she couldn't satisfy Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander lowered his head and saw the fine beads of sweat on the tip of the woman's beautiful nose. He smiled slightly. He drank the rest of the Coke in one gulp and threw the cup out. He patted his thighs, and said, "Baby, come up here, let's make you happy."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brittany instantly smiled. She obediently got on the bed and kneeled down, upper body to the man's thighs. She put the white and tender buttocks high, pouting, waiting for the punishment of pleasure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's raised hand did not fall hard on the woman's body, but covered the rounded buttock peaks, and tenderly pinched them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brittany was flattered and rushed to serve the man, and even consciously pulled up his left hand and took his two fingers into her sexy red lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She slightly twisted her thin waist, expressing the thirst in her heart, staring at Alexander with a pair of big watery eyes and an innocent expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Hehehe</span><span>, can't help it so soon?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander laughed, his left hand rubbed and pinched, and his right hand drilled between the charming buttocks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brittany immediately hummed, while twisting her waist and shaking her buttocks uncontrollably.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She tightly closed her eyes, her small mouth wide open, desperately inhaling inward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>During this period of time, she had never seen Alexander. Now when she saw it, she was immediately burning with desire, and not very intense intimacy could make her gasp for breath and roll all over her body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's fingers were speeding up, Brittany felt her body getting more and more tingly, and her delicate humming became louder and louder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She pressed her face into the soft bed surface, her whole body trembled, her left hand clutched the bed sheet desperately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander suddenly stopped moving, and then began to rotate and stir.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brittany had already reached the edge of her peak. Even if Alexander didn't change his strategy, in a few tens of seconds, she wouldn't be able to hold back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What's more, the sudden change of speed made it almost immediately uncontrollable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She hugged Alexander's neck and let their lips meet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just like crazy, just like a person who has been interrupting water in the desert for a long time suddenly found a clear spring, wildly sucking on Alexander's tongue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The last bit of strength also leaked out of her body. Only then did she leave his mouth, quickly gulping down the aroma while sticking out her tongue, gently kissing on his cheeks and lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander let Brittany lie on </span><span>his</span><span> </span><span>back and rest for a while, gently caressing her back and hair, waiting for her breathing to basically regain evenness, then he violently rolled over and pressed her underneath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey, hey, rest up, right? You're happy. I'm not satisfied yet."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmm, then please punish me, Mr. Hawthorne."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brittany stretched out her soft palm and gently combed Alexander's somewhat messy </span><span>hair neatly; the more she looked at Alexander, the more she felt he was handsome.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander stuck his tongue into Brittany's mouth, and after stirring for a while, he started kissing her </span><span>dewy face and porcelain neck as if they were going to drip with moisture.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hands from her bare armpits to start, through the charming peaks, slender waist, flat belly, tender inner thighs, until the curve of the beautiful calves before stopping.</span><span> </span></p><div class="pagination">
