Bernard doesn't know yet."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Huh? </span><span>So</span><span> you met with Rebecca first... Bernard's a vengeful type. He won't let this go," Ava said in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava was taken aback.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander simply smiled, unconcerned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ever since advancing to Intermediate Warrior, his confidence had soared, and he was ready to face any challenge and take charge of his life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Whether it was the Clifford family, Felix from the Red Umbrella Group, or SATAN, Alexander was ready for them all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bernard hobbled back home, and his subordinate rushed over with a report.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Boss, something serious happened to Mr. Clifford. Someone crippled both his hands, and he's in the hospital now, fighting for his life."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bernard froze. He was shocked as though struck by lightning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What happened?" he snarled, grabbing his subordinate by the collar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After hearing the full story, Bernard was livid.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn, Rebecca! Damn Alexander!" he shouted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bernard grabbed his phone and dialed the </span><span>Loscity</span><span> Police Department.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Benton, it's Bernard. I need to report Alexander. He crippled my son's hands..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, that. I know about it," Oliver replied. "At the time, Byron was trying to assault Ms. Hansen in public, so Alexander acted justly. There's nothing I can do."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Oliver refused outright.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bernard's eyes flashed with rage as he listened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He'd never expected Oliver, who usually maintained a friendly rapport, to be so </span><span>unyielding and disrespectful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bernard refused to give up, so he said with a forced smile, "Mr. Benton, I remember your wife's birthday is coming up. I'll be sure to prepare a nice gift."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The line went silent for a moment before Oliver responded sternly, "Bernard, all I can say is Byron was at fault. If the Hansen family had called the police, I'd be arresting him right now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, I suggest you find a good lawyer for Byron. That's all I can say; I have other matters to attend to."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Bernard could say another word, Oliver hung up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Listening to the dial tone, Bernard's expression grew stormy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn that bastard!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bernard was so furious he nearly spat blood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His subordinate urged him, "Mr. Clifford, we can't let this slide."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmph!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bernard sneered. "SATAN gave me special clearance to mobilize The Cripples. I'll make a call right now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He immediately called Eddie, the leader of The Cripples.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Cripples had lost two lieutenants, Joseph and </span><span>Houtte</span><span>, in </span><span>Loscity</span><span>, and Eddie suspected Alexander was involved. But he'd held back out of fear of Alexander's strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, with SATAN's direct orders, Eddie had been in </span><span>Loscity</span><span> for days, getting ready to target Ava and Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After finishing the call with Bernard, Eddie immediately gathered his best men.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>An hour later, an inconspicuous van parked at a corner across from the Saint Tower.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The spot gave them a perfect view of the Saint Tower while keeping them hidden.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inside the van were five men, led by a man with a pockmarked face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each wore odd necklaces, dyed hair, and had piercings on their ears, noses, and lips. It's classic Cripples attire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A bald man held his phone, repeatedly staring at a photo of Ava.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Calvin, Ms. Blackburn is gorgeous. Damn, what a body. She's stacked and got a nice ass. I'd love to get her in bed," the bald man said, swallowing hard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey Calvin, since the boss wants her brought back, can we have a little fun with her first?" he asked with a sleazy grin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvin shot him a fierce glare.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you don't want to get killed, keep it together! The boss himself gave these orders, so we can't mess it up. First, scout the area carefully. If we strike, we do it right," Calvin snapped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The bald man rolled his eyes but kept quiet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You guys, get out and take a look around. Scope out the surroundings thoroughly. We'll tail them for a bit and wait for the perfect moment to strike," Adrian instructed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvin issued the order to his men.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The bald man ignored him, still staring at Ava's photo, his mind lost in filthy fantasies.</span></p><div class="pagination">
