  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By the time Alexander wove his way out of traffic, Nate's BMW was nowhere in sight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nate was furious, pounding his steering wheel in frustration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What the hell?! How is his Buick faster than my BMW? Damn it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Alexander had suddenly accelerated, Nate tried to follow, but ended up crashing into another car, forcing him to stop and deal with the mess.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava was all smiles, her excitement almost childlike.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Nice, nice! </span><span>Your</span><span> driving just keeps getting better!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, enough flattery, or I'm </span><span>gonna</span><span> get cocky," Alexander grinned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Half an hour later, they arrived at the city's largest jewelry market.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This place wasn't just a hub for jewelry; it was also known for frequent gemstone auctions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The market was packed, bustling with people, sales reps everywhere pulling in customers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It truly lived up to its reputation&mdash;gemstones, emeralds, jewelry of every kind imaginable, probably tens of thousands of varieties.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander followed Ava into one of the biggest jewelry stores there&mdash;Astral Bistro.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Astral Bistro was a multi-floor building, more than ten stories high and spanning thousands of square meters.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The trading hall on the first floor was crowded with customers, with dozens of sales reps running around nonstop.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Led by a security guard, they made their way to the executive office on the third floor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The office was massive, over a hundred square meters, luxuriously decorated, with a huge U-shaped desk dominating the center.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Behind it sat a stunning woman dressed in a fitted, tailored suit that hugged her curves, especially emphasizing her full chest that seemed almost too perfect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When the woman saw Ava, her eyes brightened, and she stood up, her face lighting up with excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ava! You finally decided to come home!" Lynn's voice trembled as she stood, tears welling up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom..." Ava lowered her head, her voice small, looking like a kid caught doing something wrong.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lynn rushed over, pulling Ava into a tight hug, tears streaming down her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hi, Ms. Blackburn. I'm Alexander, Ava's boyfriend." Alexander quickly introduced himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't help thinking&mdash;Ava's mom looked incredibly young like she was only in her early thirties.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And they definitely looked alike. Both mother and daughter had those stunning curves&mdash;one with a mature, alluring charm, the other fresh and vibrant like a perfectly ripened peach.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Nice to meet you, nice to meet you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lynn extended her hand to shake Alexander's.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her hand was soft, her skin smooth&mdash;not what you'd expect from a woman her age.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander felt a jolt when his All-seeing Eyes accidentally picked up on what Lynn was wearing under her clothes&mdash;a fishnet lingerie set.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That's Ava's mom!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He quickly shifted his gaze, pretending to be fascinated by the office decor, doing his best to look anywhere else.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lynn's sharp eyes were fixed on Alexander, her gaze almost piercing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She could tell right away that this young man wasn't ordinary.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Especially the calm, collected demeanor&mdash;there was nothing forced about it. It came from genuine confidence. That intrigued her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She'd met a lot of people, but there was something about Alexander that drew her in&mdash;some kind of magnetism she couldn't quite put her finger on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In short, Alexander made her feel comfortable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She found herself wanting to know more about him&mdash;of course, for her daughter's sake.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava then explained the reason they were there. They needed the Obsidian Core necklace, and they were willing to pay a high price for it. She also mentioned that they wanted to buy some top-tier gemstones.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander hoped to use this opportunity to acquire high-grade gems to upgrade his lightsaber's power core, elevating it to level two to boost his strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Since your friend needs the Obsidian Core to save a life, of course, I wouldn't hesitate to help. I can sell it to you at a discount."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As for top-tier gems, those are really hard to come by. But hey, I'm free right now, so why don't I take you both to look around? Maybe we'll find something in the warehouse that'll work for you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lynn smiled </span><span>warmly,</span><span> her voice full of charm.</span></p><div class="pagination">
