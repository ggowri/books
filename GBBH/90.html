  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the car, Sebastian clutched his head, feeling utterly drained.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Quick, put out a bounty for any leads on Alexander. Whoever finds him will get five million dollars!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After hours of searching with no sign of Alexander, Sebastian felt like he was on the brink of collapse.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It felt as if a drill was spinning in his skull, the pain making him break out in a cold sweat, wishing for death to come.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His bounty announcement sent shockwaves through Loscity.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"We need to dig deep and find Alexander! Not only will you snag five million dollars, but you'll also earn the favor of Mr. Sebastian Tate from the Brilliant Group!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Alexander crippled Mr. Tate's hands! This is basically a manhunt!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Let's mobilize everyone we can! We need to find Alexander fast!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Countless clueless individuals sprang into action, fueled by adrenaline.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">They all assumed Sebastian was offering the bounty to avenge his son.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Only a select few knew the truth. Sebastian was desperately trying to plead for his life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Meanwhile, the Fairfax family was buzzing with excitement.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Andrew laughed triumphantly. "Ha! I knew Alexander was done for! With Mr. Sebastian Tate offering five million dollars right off the bat, it's curtains for him!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Belinda chimed in eagerly, "Absolutely! Our whole family needs to pitch in to find Alexander. Not only is there a hefty reward, but we could also win Mr. Sebastian Tate's favor for the Fairfax family!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The Fairfax family buzzed with enthusiasm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Finally, that loser Alexander is getting what's coming to him!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Because of him, so many partners have turned their backs on us. The losses have been huge."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"He's just a washed-up loser who relies on women. I knew he wouldn't last long. Now even Ava can't save him."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But Jane sat silently, her emotions a tangled mess as she watched her family revel in their attacks on Alexander.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Memories of Ryan and Theodore's humiliating defeat at Alexander's hands flashed through her mind, and she suddenly felt that Sebastian might not be able to handle Alexander after all.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Unable to hold back any longer, Jane spoke up, "Dad, Mom, can we all just chill for a second? I don't think Alexander is that easy to take down. He's got some serious magic skills. If he decides to use them against Sebastian, especially with that scheming Ava backing him... Sebastian might just end up with egg on his face!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Andrew burst into laughter. "Jane, do you even hear yourself?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Even if Alexander knows a bit of magic, Mr. Sebastian Tate represents the Brilliant Group.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"The chairman, Guzman, has tight ties with the City of Sorcery. With all those powerful sorcerers at his disposal, they can't possibly be outmatched by some guy like Alexander!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Belinda rolled her eyes at Jane's concerns.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Sweetheart, what are you talking about? Are you still hung up on Alexander? You've got to be kidding me!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Remember the last time we tried to get back together? He shot you down without a second thought. Why are you still thinking about him?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jane's mind drifted back to that humiliating moment when she had swallowed her pride to seek him out, even donning some risqu&eacute; lingerie, only to be met with cold rejection.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Anger and frustration bubbled up inside her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Suddenly, Andrew's eyes lit up. "Hey, Jane, why don't you lure Alexander out? I can let Mr. Sebastian Tate know. We'd not only pocket that sweet bounty but also win Mr. Tate's favor. It's a win-win!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Belinda and the rest of the Fairfax family quickly rallied behind the idea, urging Jane to bring Alexander out of hiding.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When Jane fell silent, Andrew's expression hardened.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Jane, do you really still have feelings for Alexander? That guy is heartless; he's already off with Ava. Why would he ever take you back?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With a clenched jaw, Jane finally nodded, her resolve hardening.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Seeing his daughter's agreement, Andrew couldn't help but gloat, cursing under his breath.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Damn it, I can't stand that smug look on Alexander's face. I want to see Mr. Sebastian Tate break his legs!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Belinda nodded in agreement. "If Mr. Sebastian Tate is going to handle him, it'll be like putting a wild dog in its place. We need to be there to record the whole thing on video."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Jane, hurry up and call him. Tell him it's something important about Ashley!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jane, though her face was still a thundercloud, pulled out her phone and dialed Alexander's number.</p><div class="pagination">
