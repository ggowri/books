  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"It's simple. Sell me all the iridium the Dragon Gang has collected, and I'll solve this problem for you right now," Alexander said casually, as if handling Benjamin was a piece of cake.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Norma was taken aback. Although iridium was valuable, and the Dragon Gang had a few hundred pounds of it, what did Alexander need so much for?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander asked calmly, "So, what do you think? This shouldn't be too difficult, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The others scoffed, their eyes on Alexander turning scornful and mocking, as if he were insane.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Is this guy here just for attention? How can he deal with Benjamin?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Exactly, he's probably a fraud!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Iridium is expensive; he must have ulterior motives."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The room buzzed with murmurs; no one had faith in Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Everyone, shut up!" Norma barked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At her shout, the room fell silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne, if you can win back what we lost, not only will the money be yours, but I'll also agree to your condition," Norma said, her eyes carrying a hint of intrigue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She looked at Alexander with significant intent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Good, you better keep your word."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander said no more and left the surveillance room with Marvin, heading toward the VIP lounge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At that moment, the three casino experts were already slinking away, preparing to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As they passed the door, they cast skeptical glances at Alexander, clearly not trusting him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Inside the luxurious lounge, only Benjamin and the female dealer remained.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Benjamin sat with his legs crossed, leisurely sizing up Alexander with a critical eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Click!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander closed the lounge door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Benjamin's eyes were filled with disdain. He had never seen this young man before and assumed he wasn't one of the top-ranked gambling experts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He even turned away, not bothering to acknowledge him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander sat confidently across from Benjamin, a bright smile on his face, with a sharp gleam in his deep eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A long silence followed as neither of them spoke.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Heh..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Benjamin sneered. "Are you here to play cards with me? If not, get out. I don't have time to waste on you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If Norma doesn't have the guts to send someone to play against me, she might as well shut this casino down!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His tone was arrogant, treating Alexander as if he were insignificant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As the gambling king ranked second globally, having only lost once in his life, he had the right to be cocky.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Are you looking to die?" Marvin snapped, his fierce aura making Benjamin flinch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Bang!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Benjamin slammed his hand on the table.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What's this? Is that all the guts the Dragon Gang has? Are you planning to kill me? If so, consider your casino finished."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander waved his hand, signaling Marvin to step aside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Benjamin, I think your gambling skills are mediocre. You swapped cards to win earlier. If you're brave enough, play against me. Let's see who's better," Alexander said, a sharp gleam crossing his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ah!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Suddenly, Benjamin cried out and clutched his eyes, his face contorted in pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The surveillance room erupted into a commotion, with everyone unsure of what had just happened, speculating wildly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What's going on with Benjamin? Is he sick?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Does Mr. Hawthorne have some sort of special ability?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Norma narrowed her eyes. She wasn't sure what Alexander had done, but she was certain it was connected to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If you're too scared to bet, then get lost!" Alexander taunted, full of contempt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Damn it! You're just using some hypnosis ability, aren't you? Didn't expect you've used power elixir too," Benjamin snapped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You think a little hypnotic power can help you beat me? You're dreaming!" Benjamin shouted, though he avoided direct eye contact.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander smiled and gestured. "Deal the cards!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The female dealer snapped out of her daze and began dealing the cards.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The tension in the surveillance room was palpable. Everyone stood up instinctively, staring at the screen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Over half of the wall-mounted LCD screens were displaying close-ups of Alexander and Benjamin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They held their breath, still filled with doubt about Alexander.</span></p><div class="pagination">
