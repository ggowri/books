  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay, thank you." Alexander nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, his smile disappeared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He turned and gazed in the direction of the Axe headquarters. "Oh no! Someone is attacking the headquarters!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What? Someone was attacking the headquarters?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone was stunned. There seemed to be nothing unusual, and they received no phone calls. Why did Alexander claim that?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a while, there was a gust of wind and a faint burst of gunshots.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, everyone heard it. Although the sound was very slight, it was definitely intense gunfire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh no! Something really happened! Who is attacking our headquarters?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alyssa was shocked and furious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, her cell phone rang.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After hanging up, she growled, "It's Paxton and his men! Let's go back and provide </span><span>support."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wait!" Alexander stopped her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You are few in number, so just defend here. I will go alone."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Given the surprise attack, Paxton must have prepared a trump card. Otherwise, he would not have dared to provoke the Axe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alyssa pondered about it and believed in Alexander's decision.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay. We'll wait for your call. Be careful!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alice asked with some concern, "Do you want me to go with you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You will only be a burden to me. Stay here and guard. I can handle it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander, full of confidence, patted Alice on the shoulder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone could only let him return alone. Paxton was well prepared, so it was no less than venturing into a dangerous situation this time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander, driving an off-road vehicle, stepped on the accelerator to the bottom and sped forward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, at the Axe headquarters, Stanley was organizing a counterattack with his men.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>More than two hundred people raised their guns and fired fiercely. Countless bullets were fired from all directions, immediately forming a tight firepower network.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amid the dense shower of bullets, six experts, with the utmost agility, dodged and darted forward, gradually approaching the defensive position of the Axe.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were facing a simultaneous shooting from more than two hundred men, leaving numerous bullet holes all around them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it were an ordinary person, he would have been riddled with bullets long ago.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But these six experts were very powerful and agile. They made use of various buildings, bushes, blind spots, and advanced bulletproof vests and helmets to dodge bullets with extreme efficiency.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Occasionally, bullets hit them, but they were blocked by their bulletproof vests and helmets.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Like tigers, the six experts moved closer and closer to the Axe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They started shooting while dodging.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each of them had a submachine gun, and the Axe members were knocked down one after another.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These strong men dressed in uniforms were all arranged by the Mafia for Paxton. They were indeed very aggressive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Behind them, Paxton and Beverly gathered hundreds of their men and fired fiercely at the defensive position of the Axe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gradually, the Axe lost their firepower advantage and were suppressed by them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was not the worst of it. The most frightening and disturbing thing was that an unknown mysterious person joined the battle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was obviously sent by Paxton. His whereabouts were extremely weird and completely unpredictable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every time he approached the Axe, a cloud of black smoke would be emitted, and then certain members of the Axe would fester all over and cough up blood, rolling and convulsing on the ground.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The horrifying scene sent chills down the spines of the Axe members.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were not afraid of fighting against Paxton's men but of this supernatural and strange power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Could it be a wizard?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mysterious characters like wizards could bring great psychological pressure to </span><span>ordinary people.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was evident that the position could not be held, so some people had already started trying to escape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stanley ordered his men to throw out a batch of grenades, causing a huge explosion that temporarily blocked the enemy's attack, and then led his men to fight and back away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those six Mafia experts and the wizard hiding in the dark were truly terrifying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was very frustrating that they had to retreat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Listen up, the Axe! Put down your weapons and surrender right now! Why do you insist on working for Alyssa?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You are risking your life to fight, but she has already run away!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Paxton used psychological warfare to lure the Axe members into surrendering.</span></p><div class="pagination">
