  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Betty began to dress, her long, beautiful legs lifting as she slowly pulled her stockings up to her thighs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing her round, firm buttocks, Alexander couldn't resist pinching it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Boss, what are you doing? I knew you had a naughty side... But really, I can't handle any more today," Betty said, trying to </span><span>stop</span><span> him while speeding up her dressing routine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she dressed, she said, "Ms. Blackburn seems so refined and aloof. She definitely can't satisfy you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, for your mental and physical health, let me happily take some of her burden off."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon realizing that </span><span>having sex</span><span> could accelerate his absorption of the Force left by James, Alexander felt his concerns lighten </span><span>up</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, in this world, power was everything. Only through strength could he protect himself and his loved ones; everything else was secondary.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Taking Betty in his arms, Alexander dived in for another kiss, burying his face in her plump, succulent bosom before she could put on her bra.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Betty could only whimper in submission, </span><span>filling</span><span> Alexander with a profound sense of conquest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll </span><span>let</span><span> you</span><span> go</span><span> today, but next time you dare to be </span><span>like this</span><span>, I'll make sure you can't leave the bed for a day."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Alexander's kisses and caresses, Betty melted like water.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was truly a sensitive and exquisite creature, capable of bringing immense pleasure and fulfillment to a man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander couldn't help but be glad he had divorced Jane. Otherwise, he'd still be living like a fool, oppressed by her, devoid of a normal </span><span>sex</span><span> life, drifting through life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nearly two hours had passed by the time they finally stepped out of the office. Augusta and the others wore peculiar expressions, trying hard not to laugh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander acted as if nothing had happened, while Betty, being a woman and feeling the eyes of many upon her, blushed slightly, a bit embarrassed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Betty, </span><span>build</span><span> the new headquarters for me. Aim to get it set up within a month. Don't worry about the cost&mdash;speed is the priority," Alexander instructed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing about work matters, Betty straightened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry, Boss. I'll handle it right away."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Betty </span><span>went</span><span> out of the bar, her hips swaying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instantly, a chorus of good-natured laughter erupted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marvin sidled up to the impassive Charlize, smirking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"With so many beauties around Boss, your chances are slim. Come be with me instead&mdash;I promise I won't let you down, absolutely giving you a blast..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before he could finish, Charlize slammed</span><span> her</span><span> high heel onto his foot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A piercing howl filled the bar, followed by roaring laughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander </span><span>stopped laughing</span><span> and turned to Augusta with a serious expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I need someone to investigate a private island. You used to be in the Phantom Squad. Any ideas?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Augusta's eyes lit up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry, Boss. Even though I'm not with the Phantom Squad anymore, I've got a few buddies who'd take a bullet for me. Plus, we've got the cash. Money and connections&mdash;we can find out anything we need to know."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Perfect," Alexander replied, sending Augusta the </span><span>location</span><span> of Treasure Island.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Given Sebastian</span><span> was dying </span><span>at the time, Alexander was certain he </span><span>didn</span><span>&rsquo;</span><span>t</span><span> lie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once he got firsthand </span><span>information</span><span> on Treasure Island, he could embark on an exploration, possibly catching his eldest brother</span><span>,</span><span> Augustine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After numerous disputes with him, Alexander had lost all </span><span>hope</span><span> to interact with this half-brother. His </span><span>only wanted to</span><span> eliminate Augustine and be done with it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for Anthony, the second brother who controlled the Red Umbrella Group, he was even more sinister and </span><span>mysterious</span><span>, making it exceedingly difficult for Alexander to track him down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After covering crucial matters, Alexander </span><span>planned to</span><span> offer them a few words of encouragement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But then his phone buzzed&mdash;it was Jane calling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's face contorted with annoyance as he grimaced and hung up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She called again, but he still didn't pick up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead, he shot off a quick message: [Someone will be delivering a check. This is the last time I'm helping you </span><span>for</span><span> Ashley's </span><span>sake</span><span>. From now on, the Fairfax family's affairs are no longer my concern.]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He pulled out Jackson's ten-million-dollar check and handed it to Logan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Take this to the Fairfax family and tell them it's my final act of compassion on Ashley's behalf. If they keep pestering me, they'd better watch out!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
