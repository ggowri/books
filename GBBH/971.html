  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Grace said this while looking at Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Madelyn keenly sensed Grace's nervousness. She thought, "Could it be that Grace had a crush on Alexander?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Madelyn suddenly felt a little anxious and said quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Grace, Asher has spread the news. Now everyone knows that he is your fianc&eacute;."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What?" Grace was angry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If Asher could cure Gavin's old injury, her family would force her to marry him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This was the tragedy of children from wealthy families. They could not even choose their own marriage and must make the best choice for the benefit of their family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Grace, isn't Asher from the Vance family? Don't you like him? I heard that he is not only good at martial arts, but also has great medical skills. He is known as a genius. Why don't you just marry him?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Madelyn started joking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Grace waved her hands unhappily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She said, "Stop that. I'll get angry! If you like him, I can introduce you to him. That way, he won't pester me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Madelyn said, "I don't like him. All men are perverts. Once they get what they want, they won't care about you anymore."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Madelyn giggled and looked at Alexander meaningfully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander knew that Madelyn was talking about him, so he could only smile bitterly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They were chatting and laughing, glancing at Alexander from time to time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Many men were staring at them, wanting to come over and strike up a conversation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>What made them angry was that Alexander was only concerned with eating and didn't pay much attention to the two women.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mom! This is my friend, Madelyn."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Grace introduced Madelyn to Ave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander turned around and saw a beautiful middle-aged woman standing behind him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ave should be in her forties, but she looked like a woman in her early thirties, mature and elegant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mom, this is Alexander!" Grace introduced Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander put down the food and stood up politely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ave glanced at Alexander with an unhappy expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She said, "Grace, what are you doing? Asher has been waiting for you for a long time. Why don't you go in?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Hurry up and say hello to Asher."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Grace snorted disdainfully and said with a straight face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She said, "No. I don't want to see that bastard. I want him to get out."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander couldn't help laughing out loud.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ave's face turned gloomy immediately, but she didn't want to get angry at Grace in front of everyone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander kindly persuaded them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ms. Lawson, you should go and say hello. You can say no to him explicitly, and maybe he'll leave you alone."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ave snorted, stared at Alexander unhappily, and said, "Don't interfere in our family's affairs. Stop talking nonsense here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Grace immediately lost her temper and said angrily, "Mom, what do you mean? If it weren't for Alexander helping Grandpa, Grandpa's injuries would have been out of control long ago. You have to apologize to Alexander!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ave became even angrier. She never expected that Grace would embarrass her in public for a stranger. It was really too much.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ave sneered, "A gang leader, who made his fortune by relying on women, dares to come here. He's garbage!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander's expression suddenly changed, and he almost turned around and left, not caring about Gavin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Grace saw Alexander's expression and immediately knew that he was really angry. She quickly grabbed Alexander's arm and said in a low voice, "Alexander, don't be angry. My mother is short-sighted. I apologize to you on her behalf, and I will tell Grandfather about this matter. He will teach her a lesson."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander's mood softened a bit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ave glared at Alexander fiercely and took Grace's hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She said, "Don't be so close to him. Come to meet Asher!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Grace didn't want to go, but she didn't want Ave and Alexander to have another conflict.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She agreed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before leaving, she told Madelyn, "I will be back soon."</span></p><div class="pagination">
