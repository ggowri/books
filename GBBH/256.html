  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ghost Hand?" Alexander's expression turned serious. This was the high-level witchcraft mentioned in the Ultimate Legacy. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A great warrior had seized some magic powder after defeating a white wizard who was on the verge of becoming a sorcery lich. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was from that encounter that the warrior had witnessed the power of Ghost Hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the Ghost Hand that Guzman used wasn't fully developed; otherwise, Alexander's soul might have been extracted. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was certain that Guzman's strength alone wasn't enough to perform the Ghost Hand&mdash;he needed the power of the Ancestral Witch's Cane.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Guzman seemed like a different person. He looked sinister and cold, his face pale as if he were a corpse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, you know about Ghost Hand? Why don't you kneel and beg for mercy?" Guzman laughed, the sound eerie and chilling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander snorted disdainfully. "If you were a sorcery lich, maybe I'd consider it. But you're not."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite his confidence, Alexander wasn't sure if the Force could handle Guzman. However, he was prepared; if he couldn't win, he could at least escape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, I will kill you!" Guzman shouted, raising the Ancestral Witch's Cane and waving it at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A curse swept toward Alexander, threatening to sap his speed and strength. It felt as though a mountain was pressing down on him, weighing him down and clouding his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Guzman advanced with an evil smile, the dark hand of magic poised to strangle Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a flash, the remaining Force within Alexander surged, and he struck Guzman hard in the face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah!" Guzman screamed as he was sent flying backward, the Ancestral Witch's Cane slipping from his grasp. A ball of white flame ignited on his darkened face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The flame wasn't large, but it burned fiercely, causing Guzman to scream in agony. No matter how hard he tried, he couldn't extinguish it. Instead, it grew more intense, consuming him like ice melting under the sun.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah! Save me! Someone, help me!" Guzman rolled on the ground as the white flames consumed his upper body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was momentarily stunned. He hadn't expected the Force Burning to be so effective against wizards. He thought his punch would only injure Guzman, not kill him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Force Burning could incinerate all evil, and it wouldn't stop until it was done.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Guzman collapsed, twitching and struggling, until he became motionless. His body quickly turned to ash, scattered by the sea breeze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Plop!" The members of the Bryant family fell to their knees, pleading with Alexander for mercy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Please spare us. It was all Guzman's doing. We were forced into this."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne, please forgive us. We were unaware and had no say in the matter."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander glanced around, his gaze causing everyone to bow their heads. He then turned to Cloe, who lay unconscious on the ground. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Guzman's death, the Ancestral Witch's Cane had stopped draining her blood. It now lay dull and lifeless, the skull at its top vanished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander picked up the Cane. Though members of the Bryant family eyed it greedily, no one dared to challenge him. He helped Cloe up, transferring a stream of the Force into her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cloe slowly regained consciousness, looking around in confusion. She saw no sign of Guzman, only the Bryant family members kneeling. She looked at Alexander in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander asked in a firm voice, "Do you want to end up like Guzman, or do you want to become the president of the Brilliant Group and manage Treasure Island?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course, I want to live and become the CEO, Mr. Hawthorne. I submit to you!" Cloe replied, her intelligence apparent. Without hesitation, she knelt before Alexander.</span></p><div class="pagination">
