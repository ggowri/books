  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The raid on Mandale Town had failed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Axe suffered heavy losses and lost several loyal wizards.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Yvonne, I never thought you'd be useless too. It's better that you're gone," Monica thought angrily, her smile fading into a cold expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She stayed calm and spoke loudly to the crowd, "Today, we gather to celebrate our 100th anniversary and the safe return of Rock Rossetti."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She continued, "And I have good news. After his time in seclusion, Rock has now advanced to become a white wizard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"From today on, Rock will be the second white wizard in our City of Sorcery."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone gasped, their expressions complicated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was no small feat to become a white wizard. The City of Sorcery's power had grown again, making their own positions weaker and forcing them to flatter the City of Sorcery even more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The room suddenly felt colder as the guests' spirits sank.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Monica scanned the crowd. "What's wrong? Aren't you happy?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They quickly bowed and hid their uneasy expressions. "Of course, we are happy. Congratulations to Mr. Rossetti and the City of Sorcery."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Yeah, congratulations."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Hmph. You'd better behave from now on. Anyone who dares disobey me will find no place to rest, even in death," Monica sneered, feeling pleased with her authority.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Just then, a dark wizard stepped forward and whispered to Monica, "Ms. Quinn, we've found out that Yvonne and Woodrow's disappearance is related to Alexander."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Alexander, that pest. Why is he everywhere?" Monica snapped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She slammed her hand on the table, making everyone around her jump.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ms. Quinn, Alexander has become a serious threat. Even the plague couldn't stop him. Let's focus our strength to destroy him once and for all."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Yes, Alexander took the Ancestral Witch's Cane and the Spirit Bead Bracelet. We must get them back and make him pay."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The wizards shouted, all supporting the idea to eliminate Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Monica thought carefully about the best course of action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Suddenly, the doorkeeper announced loudly from outside, "Mr. Rossetti has arrived."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Rock's appearance instantly drew everyone's attention.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He was a white wizard now, an equal in power to Monica.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone looked at him with awe, fear, and respect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even Monica stared at him, not blinking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Rock was different now. Without her protective amulet, Monica couldn't be sure who would win if she and Rock fought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Back when they discovered an ancient wizard's tomb, they found a mystical poison, the Ancient Grimoire, and a powerful amulet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Monica had claimed the poison and amulet, while Rock obtained the Ancient Grimoire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A group of people quickly entered, led by Rock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He wore a white robe and held the black Ancient Grimoire in his right hand. He was calm and imposing, no longer the disheveled figure seen at Treasure Island.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>All the wizards and guests in the hall held their breath in silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Monica smiled and waved. "Rock, come here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Rock was surprised that Monica called him like that in front of everyone. Clearly, she was showing off her higher rank.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Rock walked over and bowed to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Yes, Ms. Quinn?" he asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>No one noticed his resentment as he lowered his head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If Monica weren't the ruler of the city, he wouldn't have been with her. She was old and wicked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Things were different now. He was also a white wizard and had ambitions for the throne.</span></p><div class="pagination">
