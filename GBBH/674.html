  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beverly sank down on the couch with a deep sigh, feeling that she was safe at last.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought, "He must have thought I ran away. He can't find me anyway. I'll hide for a few days and then get a chance to slip away."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beverly was secretly proud that she was the only one who survived.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Snap!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She turned on the lights. Dozens of incandescent lamps lit up in the spacious basement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The display cases were filled with antiques and jewelry, as well as a large number of gold bars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The pile of brand-new cash was six feet long and wide and more than three feet high. These were hundreds of millions of dollars at least.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beverly ignored all this wealth. She took off her clothes and prepared to take a shower, then have a sleep and watch TV to relax and calm her tense mood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, Beverly's face changed drastically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why are you here? How did you get in?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was actually lying on the bed in the bedroom with a playful smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said, "Why can't I come in? You can't hide from me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stood up and looked at the display cases.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Some of them were valuable antiques.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These jewels were also made by famous people and were worth a lot of money.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your collection is quite good. It should be worth a lot of money!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This antique has been valued at over one hundred million dollars each at international auction houses. I didn't expect you to have seven pieces here. And they are all great pieces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is a bracelet made of a top-grade purple gem. It should have a history of hundreds of years. Very good!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander picked up the bracelet. He looked calm, but he was excited.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He finally found a top-grade purple gem. He only needed one top-grade orange gem to upgrade the Lightsaber core.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander put the bracelet into his pocket, then looked at each display case one by one, talking. Beverly trembled with surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You have very good eyes... I'll give you all these things. Please let me go!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beverly begged for mercy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was in a very good mood now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He smiled, "You are a very smart woman. If you can give me a piece of top-grade orange gem, I can spare your life."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Orange gem? Really?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beverly asked excitedly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was stunned. She looked like she really had it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beverly seemed to be afraid that Alexander would go back on his word, so she quickly opened a drawer of a display cabinet and took out a small black wooden box.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She opened it. There were two orange gems in it, one large and one small.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was surprised. They were indeed orange top-grade gems.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He immediately grabbed the wooden box and examined it carefully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, very good!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After careful confirmation, Alexander couldn't wait to integrate the gems into the core of the Lightsaber.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Please... I have already given you the gemstones. And everything here is yours... Please don't kill me. I am willing to obey you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beverly straightened her plump breasts. She revealed a seductive look and walked towards Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was the most beautiful woman in </span><span>Mandale</span><span> Town. She had a hot body and was very seductive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The atmosphere became ambiguous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beverly was very confident in her beauty and figure and believed that the powerful man would not refuse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought he would get excited.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beverly was not only afraid of Alexander, but full of admiration for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smiled and pressed on Beverly's carotid artery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beverly fell down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander took out the two gemstones and prepared to integrate them into the Lightsaber core. He couldn't wait.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A quarter of an hour later, Alexander put away his Lightsaber with satisfaction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Lightsaber was finally successfully upgraded. And its power more than doubled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The previous level-one Lightsaber could cut through the armor of a main battle tank. And the Lightsaber could easily cut through an entire tank now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, the temperature of the Lightsaber could be adjusted according to Alexander's wishes. And Alexander could even cover it with the flame burning by the Force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This would make the Lightsaber even more powerful!</span></p><div class="pagination">
