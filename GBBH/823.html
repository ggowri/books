She confessed her mission honestly and in detail.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her goal was to control Alexander. If successful, she would be promoted by Yinson to be the vice president of the Sakura Society.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Because her ability was very special, Yinson let her try it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was Sakura Society again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander narrowed his eyes and looked angry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Sofia was frightened by Alexander's murderous aura and quickly knelt on the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She knew that if Alexander wanted to kill her, it would be easier than killing a chicken.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Moreover, this was Loscity, the territory of Ultimate Alliance, and everything was controlled by Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander pondered for a while and asked, "What's the matter with the living dead? What other plans do you have?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The living dead? What is that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Sofia looked at Alexander in confusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing her stupid look, Alexander knew Sofia's level was too low, and she didn't know many secrets about the Sakura Society. No wonder Yinson sent her to try because she wouldn't leak any secrets anyway.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander smiled coldly. No matter what, he would never keep Sofia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Because her special ability was strange, and men couldn't guard against it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander slapped Sofia on the forehead, and the Force was input into her, immediately destroying some of Sofia's nerves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Once the nervous system was damaged, Sofia's special abilities would also disappear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Sofia felt as if her body was splitting apart, and she fainted on the ground from the pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, Alexander called Augusta and asked him to bring people over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After a while, Augusta arrived with a group of men with more than a dozen cars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Augusta saw Sofia lying on the ground at a glance and asked quickly, "Mr. Hawthorne, are you okay?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"She is a level-one metahuman from the Sakura Society. She wanted to attack me, but I destroyed her abilities. Lock her up first."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander ordered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Augusta got angry when he heard this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"It's Sakura Society again. We haven't even dealt with them yet, but now they're causing trouble in our territory again!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He sternly ordered his men, "Take her away and lock her up. Don't let her die. When she wakes up, I will interrogate her thoroughly."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander nodded and said, "Just don't let her die. Get more information. It will be helpful for our trip to Risun."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Okay!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Augusta respectfully escorted Alexander to the car. Only when the taillights of the car were out of sight did he turn his head to look at Sofia, who was handcuffed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Search this place thoroughly."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Under Augusta's order, everyone immediately took action and turned the store upside down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In a luxurious underground office of the Sakura Society, Elaine was reporting to Yinson, "Mr. White, Sofia has been missing for twelve hours and we can't get in touch with her. It seems that she is in danger."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yinson nodded indifferently and said, "Well, I understand. I thought Sofia had a special identity and might be able to control Alexander, but I didn't expect that she would fail again..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He sighed, rubbed his temple, and said, "Once Apocalypse Project is implemented, Alexander will die, and the secrets he possesses will disappear. It's such a pity."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. White, don't worry. By then, the whole world will belong to us. Alexander's secrets won't matter."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Elaine smiled charmingly and sat on Yinson's thighs, kissing him passionately with her lips pressed against his.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yinson's hands rubbed her breasts, then moved to her plump buttocks and kneaded them hard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Well... I want it, ah!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Elaine's moans suddenly became louder, and her head tilted back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It turned out that Yinson was massaging between her buttocks, giving her intense stimulation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Did General Bowen play with your ass, honey?"</span></p><div class="pagination">
