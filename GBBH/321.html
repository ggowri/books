"If you harass us again, I guarantee you'll regret being born."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The deadly intent sent a shiver through Marcos' entire body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hel... help me..." Marcos stammered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His two bodyguards finally snapped to their senses, charging forward with angry shouts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Alexander simply hurled Marcos at them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a whoosh, Marcos was thrown like a cannonball, crashing into his bodyguards.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The three of them collapsed, rolling over each other in pain, unable to even get up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All the passengers fell silent, watching Alexander with fear; not one dared to intervene.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander glanced around, and they quickly averted their gazes, pretending to see nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Huff... huff..." Marcos gasped, his vision dark, feeling as if his neck was about to snap.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Alexander grabbed him earlier, it was as if Death's scythe had been placed at his throat, threatening his life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One guard clutched his chest while the other held his head, both in extreme pain, clearly suffering from the earlier impact.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, hurried footsteps and shouting could be heard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander turned to see flight officers and crew members rushing over, alarmed by the commotion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After taking a few deep breaths, Marcos finally regained his composure, genuinely thinking he was about to die moments before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You bastard. You dare hit me! Just wait until we get to Tijuana&mdash;I'll make you pay!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcos swore vengefully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander sneered dismissively, not even bothering to respond.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Forget him. Don't let this maniac ruin your mood," Madelyn said, tugging Alexander's arm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who told you to start a fight here? Anyone who causes trouble again will be removed from the plane immediately," the air marshal sternly warned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcos opened his mouth as if to argue but held back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As a celebrity and Caleb's son, if people found out he got beaten on a plane, he'd be humiliated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he would definitely get revenge for this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once they reached Tijuana, his territory, he'd make sure this kid wouldn't leave in one piece.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Madelyn smirked. "You're a celebrity&mdash;don't want to see headlines about you getting beaten on a plane, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcos gritted his teeth, remaining silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander kept smiling, but to Marcos, that radiant smile looked like the face of a devil.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, Marcos felt a chilling murderous intent, making him freeze in place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked at Alexander with fear; this guy must have killed before&mdash;his aura was even deadlier than his father's subordinates.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcos didn't dare say anything, knowing that if he spoke, this guy might actually finish him off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He forced a grim expression and said, "This is a misunderstanding; we were just messing around."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander patted Marcos on the shoulder, making him shudder with fright.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The air marshal watched Alexander coldly, aware that something was off, but since no one was pursuing it, he decided to let it go.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You all remember this&mdash;if you cause trouble again, you'll be arrested for endangering public safety!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After sternly warning them, the air marshal left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Walter looked at Alexander with a complex expression. He thought he'd have to step in to calm things down, but Alexander managed to make Marcos suffer without even getting physical.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Throughout the rest of the flight, Alexander and Madelyn chatted and laughed together.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Marcos sat there, face pale, completely silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, the flight landed at </span><span>Tijuanea</span><span> Airport.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcos immediately stood up and darted off the plane like a rabbit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had already messaged his dad, arranging for dozens of capable men to wait outside&mdash;he couldn't let this grudge go unavenged.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Think you can mess with me? Just you wait!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcos sneered darkly, determined to avenge this insult or die trying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But as soon as he got off the plane, he was surrounded by a swarm of reporters.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Brooks, someone tipped us off that you were harassing a woman on the plane and got beaten up by her husband. Care to explain?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Could you clarify the situation? Was it true you got hit for flirting with a woman?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Reporters crowded around Marcos, bombarding him with questions.</span></p><div class="pagination">
