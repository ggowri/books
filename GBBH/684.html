  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander pondered for a moment, realizing he needed to rush to Treasure Island. His showdown with Felix was fast approaching.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He quickly gathered the top members of the Ultimate Alliance, instructing Charlize and Rosalia to select a team of five hundred elite fighters to accompany him to Treasure Island the following day.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, he assigned Marvin and Betty to protect Ava and Ashley.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, his phone rang, and upon seeing the caller ID, he frowned slightly. It was Shadow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander wondered, "Why would he suddenly be calling?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Is it another order from the old man?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Or is Felix stirring up trouble behind the scenes?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A flurry of thoughts ran through his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne, let's meet tomorrow in </span><span>Tijuanea</span><span>. There's something important."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shadow said briefly before hanging up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was puzzled, but since he was already planning to head toward Treasure Island, he decided he could make a quick stop in </span><span>Tijuanea</span><span> first.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The following evening, bathed in the glow of a stunning sunset, a large convoy of ten buses and several luxury cars made its way to an estate on the outskirts of </span><span>Tijuanea</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the convoy stopped, Alexander stepped out of the lead BMW 7 Series.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, the estate was heavily guarded, with armed soldiers densely packed around it, and it was impossible to tell how many watchmen were on duty secretly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Light and heavy weaponry glinted menacingly around the grounds, and black muzzles </span><span>were aimed directly at Alexander's convoy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In addition to the guards, Alexander's All-seeing Eyes detected several powerful figures inside the mansion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were over a hundred strong individuals, all metahuman or martial arts experts, gathered for what appeared to be a lavish banquet in the dining hall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A young man in a suit approached with a polite bow. "Please follow me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander signaled Charlize and Rosalia to accompany him, leaving the others outside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He trusted that Shadow, being the most loyal bodyguard to the Godfather and having expressed his support, would not attempt any harm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The banquet hall was immense, spanning thousands of square feet, with several smaller lounges and VIP rooms surrounding it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The men and women at the event were all engaged in polite conversation, exuding an air of sophistication that was clearly high society.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even the servers, despite their role, were dressed immaculately and conducted themselves with dignity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The male servers wore sleek black tuxedos, while the female servers were dressed in seductive bunny costumes, looking irresistibly charming.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Occasionally, one of the attractive servers, male or female, would be led into a private room by one of the powerful guests, not to be seen again for some time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The atmosphere at the banquet, though sophisticated, was tinged with a decadent allure. It was a surprising sight, given the strength and influence of those in attendance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shadow spotted Alexander right away and approached him with a warm smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shadow."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander greeted, extending his hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shadow lowered his head, grasping Alexander's hand with both of his, a gesture of surprising humility that caught Alexander off guard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though Shadow had previously expressed his support, Alexander hadn't expected such respect since he had not yet formally inherited the Godfather's title or earned the feared moniker "Reaper."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"These are Rosalia and Charlize," Alexander introduced his companions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shadow laughed heartily. "Mr. Hawthorne, you've got me envious! If I were twenty years younger, I'd give you a run for your money with the ladies!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, before Alexander could ask any questions, Shadow continued.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Godfather sent us here. He no longer supports Felix and has chosen you as his successor."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shadow's expression was complex as he spoke, his eyes moistening slightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was taken aback, a mix of emotions washing over him rather than the excitement he might have expected.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For the first time, he felt a faint, unfamiliar sentiment toward this father he had never met.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Scanning the room, Alexander didn't see the elderly man he had envisioned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shadow bowed respectfully and explained, "The Godfather had some urgent matters to attend to but will arrive shortly."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He then went on to clarify why so many powerful individuals had gathered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Godfather intends to help you take Treasure Island decisively. Mr. Anthony Hawthorne's alliance with the City of Sorcery to construct a Demon Summoning Array has infuriated him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Back in the day, the Godfather and Rock were bitter enemies; they even killed members of each other's families. There's blood vengeance between them. That Anthony Hawthorne would disregard this to ally with Rock has left the Godfather deeply disappointed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"More importantly, the Godfather admires your abilities and character!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
