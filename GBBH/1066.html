  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barbara totally broke down. After all, she had no power, and Cyclops had already humiliated her countless times, relying on his manipulation of her personality.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And today, he finally shattered the last hint of her self-esteem and stubbornness with that whip.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laughing out aloud, Cyclops slapped her sexy butt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Very good. You finally know who you are. You'll be my slave from now on," he said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, I'm your humblest slave. Please don't hit me!" Barbara had completely surrendered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Good! Release her. I'll watch her crawl back like a dog," Cyclops ordered one of his subordinates.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A man uncuffed Barbara to let her kneel on the ground and dragged the chain on her choker like walking a dog.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Does anyone want to defy me now?" Cyclops cracked the whip and asked the rest of the women viciously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>None of them dared to resist, and all lowered their heads in submission.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, those men all rushed to put pet tags around their necks and took advantage of this opportunity to caress their bodies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those women were too weak to resist their outrageous behaviors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay, lock them up." Cyclops signaled his men to push those women into cells one by one.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You, come with me. The contract of ownership transfer is not done yet."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, he pulled the chain and dragged Barbara with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She whined but didn't dare to protest and could only follow him behind like a dog.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, a burst of sharp gunfire startled Cyclops, who was absorbed in a sense of domination.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wondered if someone was breaking into the hotel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But it was the Obsidian Gang's territory, which meant no one should have the guts to start a riot on Aetheris Street now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shit! Cyclops, there's something out there!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just when Cyclops was in confusion, one of his men rushed to him and shouted in panic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He kicked him and roared, "What are you panicking? I'm still here! Tell me exactly what is happening!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Obsidian Gang launched the attack... I don't know what is going on, but they are attacking us!" the man said breathlessly with a pale face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What? How can it be? Why are they targeting us when we have paid Chase protection fees? Are you sure they are from the Obsidian Gang?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although in rage, Cyclops still couldn't believe it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The gunshots became more and more intense, accompanied by blasts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Cyclops was in the basement, he could still feel the ferocity of the battle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He only had a dozen people here and surely couldn't survive such a serious situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What should we do?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All his men looked anxious as they were also aware of the slim chance of survival.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We gotta go. Leave Aetheris Street and find another chance to retaliate against the Obsidian Gang," Cyclops roared and led his men to the outside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In order to flee as soon as possible, he left Barbara and those women here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this time, outside the hotel, Trenton was trying to please Alexander with a flattering smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne, we have surrounded the whole hotel to make sure Cyclops has no place to escape!" he said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, a sudden bang startled Trenton.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A black extended version of Cadillac rushed out from the underground parking lot, followed by two black Mercedes-Benz cars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fire! Don't let them go!" Trenton shouted to order his men, and the fat on his face vibrated along with his move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was beside him, and he had to behave himself in front of him since the Obsidian Gang only recognized Alexander as the real boss. As for Ariella, she was merely Alexander's puppet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, dozens of guns aimed at the three cars, and bullets rained at them in a second. However, those cars were like mad cows, darting outside in the shower of bullets.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One of the Mercedes-Benz cars was hit on the tire and immediately crashed into a big tree on the side of the road.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, people from the Obsidian Gang concentrated fire on it. Everyone inside was slaughtered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Another Mercedes-Benz steered too hurriedly in order to dodge the bullets but ended up in turnover.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was immediately attacked by concentrated fire. The fuel tank was hit, and a raging blaze broke out from the vehicle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With an explosion, the only things left there were a huge fireball and scattered car parts.</span></p><div class="pagination">
