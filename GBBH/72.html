  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The atmosphere shifted dramatically as whispers and murmurs rippled through the crowd.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mr. Federer, aren't you interested in partnering with the Brilliant Group? We could easily offer your family half the profits. That's quite a chunk of change," Theodore said, flashing a confident smile at a rotund, bald man.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">They had already struck a preliminary deal; all that remained was to formalize it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">David, cigar dangling from his lips, replied with a smirk, "Mr. Tate, what are you talking about?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'm a legitimate politician. I only deal in a legitimate business.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Why on earth would I get involved with something like 'Euphoria'&mdash;a drug, for crying out loud?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Theodore choked on his words, taken aback. Just days ago, David had been eager to negotiate better terms with him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The tides seemed to be turning.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Regaining his composure, Theodore turned to a glamorous woman in a backless gown. "Dear Ms. Moore, shall we finalize our agreement with the Blood Gang today?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I promised you a half-price deal..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Suddenly, Mary erupted in laughter, cutting him off mid-sentence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her ample curves swayed enticingly with each giggle.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She said, "Mr. Tate, we don't have any agreement. Starting today, the Blood Gang is steering clear of all drugs. We're only selling a health product&mdash;magic powder!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Health product? Magic powder? What in the world is that? Have you all lost your minds?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Theodore was flabbergasted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He thought these people were throwing away a lucrative deal for some health gimmick!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Suppressing his anger and disbelief, he cautiously approached a sharply dressed man.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mr. Hartmann, you know the Cripples have had their run-ins with the Saint Group. Joseph's death was no accident. Our agreement..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Before he could finish, Houtte Hartmann chuckled. "Mr. Tate, I just took over Joseph's position. I'm not privy to any agreements. Our conflicts with the Saint Group? Just misunderstandings&mdash;small potatoes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"And as for Joseph? Just an unfortunate accident!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Houtte shot Alexander a meaningful glance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Theodore's face paled. "Mr. Hartmann, I'm willing to cut the profits in half. Let's make this partnership work!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Houtte laughed heartily, and Theodore felt a weight lift off his shoulders.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He couldn't afford to lose a client like the Cripples; otherwise, he'd be in deep trouble with his uncle.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But after the laughter subsided, Houtte's expression turned serious.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mr. Tate, we're in a new era of technological advancement. Your products are outdated.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"We, the Cripples, are moving on from your offerings. We're all in on 'magic powder' now. It's the real future, and we want to contribute positively to society."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Theodore nearly choked on his own fury.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The Cripples were notorious for their ruthless ways, and here they were, pretending to have a moral compass.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Desperate, Theodore approached several other powerful families and organizations, only to find them all backing out of their agreements, insisting they would only sell magic powder from now on.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Theodore was seething, his face flushed with rage.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What is this magic powder anyway? What kind of nonsense health product could possibly make you give up piles of cash? Are you all out of your minds?!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Houtte retorted, irritation creeping into his voice. "Theodore, who are you calling crazy?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">David and Mary exchanged disapproving glances at Theodore, their eyes burning with barely concealed anger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At that moment, Billy stepped forward, brimming with confidence. "Mr. Tate, 'magic powder' is a health supplement I sell.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It's completely harmless and actually boosts physical health with a thrill that might even surpass your products.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Why don't you switch to selling 'magic powder'? Given the Brilliant Group's extensive sales network, I can offer you a 5% discount. What do you say?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Theodore glared at Billy with a snarl. "Who the hell are you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Billy puffed out his chest. "Billy from the Wolf Gang!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"The Wolf Gang? Billy?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Theodore puzzled for a moment, unfamiliar with the name.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His aides whispered in his ear, and Theodore's face cleared in realization.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Ah, just a washed-up thug. What a trash! You think you can compete with the Brilliant Group? Dream on!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Billy's face flushed with anger. "Who are you calling trash?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Theodore sneered, saying, "I'm calling you trash!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With that, he swung his arm and delivered a sharp slap across Billy's face.</p><div class="pagination">
