  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane felt as if a cold snake was crawling on her, sending chills down her spine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You won't get away with this! Even if you avoid the military tribunal, Alexander will kill you one day!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane cursed, struggling desperately, but her struggles were futile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you really trying to scare me with Alexander? Haven't you two already divorced?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Schroder was furious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've changed my mind. Everyone, go!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With his command, the others were instantly excited.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane felt faint at the thought of being humiliated like an animal in a zoo.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought of Alexander and deeply regretted everything that had led to this moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If she hadn't forced him into a divorce, would she be in this situation now?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane felt the pain in her heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"General, something happened! Otis... They are...!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, someone rushed in, flustered and unable to articulate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Schroder sensed something was wrong and snapped. "What's happening? What about Otis?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He said he found Alexander and led a team to confront him, but... they were wiped out! Alexander has broken through!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What! Alexander is here? Impossible..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Schroder was stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bang!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A sudden explosion echoed from outside, reverberating into the basement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From the surveillance footage, they could see the heavy villa door burst from its frame and crashed to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As dust rose in the chaos, Alexander charged in, followed by Augusta and Marvin, along with a dozen loyal subordinates.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bang!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gunfire erupted. Alexander squinted, instinctively dodging as a bullet grazed his cheek, leaving a deep dent in the floor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For a seasoned Warrior, avoiding bullets was second nature.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was only when he underestimated his opponent that he was caught off guard and might be shot by a sniper.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Turning to the sniper on the rooftop, he flicked his wrist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Whoosh!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A gleaming dagger sliced through the air, piercing the sniper's chest and sending him flying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The alarms blared loudly in the villa, but Schroder's team had been reduced to just one group, with half of them still in the basement with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Alexander stormed in like a force of nature, panic erupted among them. Some were taken down, while others threw up their hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The basement was filled with fear, and some even contemplated fleeing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Schroeder roared. "Calm down, you idiots! They won't be able to leave alive!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His subordinates steadied slightly, forgetting about Jane as they quickly drew their weapons and formed a combat line.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a cold smirk, Schroder continued, "That guy thinks he can show off just because he's skilled. They think we don't have any experts on our side? If you don't act soon, I </span><span>won't be able to ally with the Red Umbrella Group!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The others looked around in surprise, wondering if there were indeed hidden Warriors from the Red Umbrella Group nearby.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But aside from their own, not a single shadow could be seen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, several figures dropped from the ceiling, startling everyone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were a group of </span><span>Soutaxia</span><span> men dressed in tight combat gear. Their bronzed skin was taut over powerful muscles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They cast a deep glance at Schroder and then blocked the entrance to the basement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Schroder excitedly shouted, "Everyone, don't be afraid! These are the Shadow Warriors from the Red Umbrella Group, all enhanced by power elixir!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His subordinates were instantly thrilled. They had heard of this power elixir, and the name "Shadow Warriors" sounded impressive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Alexander arrived at the basement entrance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without a sound, two Shadow Warriors charged toward him like phantoms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They brandished two gleaming Kukri daggers, their blades sharp and glinting ominously, capable of severing a bull's head with a single strike.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their speed was astonishing, and the force of their attack was overwhelming.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For the first time, Alexander chose to retreat rather than engage head-on.</span></p><div class="pagination">
