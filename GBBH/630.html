  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gradually, blood flowed from the corners of Richel's mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bruno jumped up and bit the woman's hand, making her scream in pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How dare you bite me, you little bastard!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man grabbed the wine bottle and hit Bruno hard on the kneecap.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From then on, Bruno had a lame leg.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get out! Bitch! Bastard! Get out! Don't come to work tomorrow."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the end, Richel and Bruno were kicked out of the restaurant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was late at night and raining heavily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the heavy rain, they hugged each other tightly, and both of them were soaked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Richel's body was covered with wounds, and blood kept oozing out from her mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bruno limped, but he clenched his teeth and didn't cry out in pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They didn't receive any salary, and even their luggage was thrown into the trash.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Richel and Bruno hugged each other and cried bitterly. One of them was a single mother who was expelled from her family, and the other was a bastard despised by everyone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The heavy pressure of life made it hard for them to bear this pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Some people said that Bruno was a child who would bring bad luck and that if Richel sent him to an orphanage, she would live better. However, Richel never gave up on Bruno, even in the most difficult days.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All the memories flashed through Bruno's mind like scenes from a film, arousing his hatred, anger, despair, and sadness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bruno's eyes turned cold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He gently stroked Richel's urn, tears falling down his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Bruno was ten years old, Richel died in a car accident while trying to protect him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After that, he took a machete and walked into the forest alone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Twenty years had passed when he came out of that forest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>During the twenty years, Bruno lived in the forest. He killed wild animals and practiced swordsmanship every day.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had no teacher to teach him. The wolves, tigers, leopards, and pythons in the forest were all his teachers. Every fight could improve his abilities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>During those battles, Bruno was disfigured and had countless scars on his body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he was not afraid because he wanted revenge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gradually, this vast forest became Bruno's territory.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For countless days and nights, the flash of the machete could be seen in the dark forest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bruno had become a savage and had lost track of time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, Bruno could use his tattered machete to chop a tiger into two halves with one stroke.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He succeeded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had an instinct that surpassed that of wild beasts. His physical strength seemed endless, and his speed was very fast.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After leaving the forest, Bruno found the host and hostess. He chopped off their limbs and hung them at the door of the restaurant, letting them bleed to death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bruno used the cruelest method to kill those who had bullied them one by one.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A thunder rolled across the sky, waking Bruno from his painful memories.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His tears had dried up. He stood there with lifeless eyes and a trembling body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't shed tears easily, but now, the memories raised his sadness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He must fulfill his mother's last wish and bury her in the Hawkins family's cemetery. He must let her return to the Hawkins family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander. I'm sorry. To fulfill my mother's last wish, you have to die."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bruno put on his mask again. He picked up the machete and walked out the door step by step.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The rain flowed down his mask, but he was unaware of it. Instead, he smiled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a smile of relief and happiness but also ferocity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Alexander saw this scene, he would be shocked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bruno was much stronger than the people in the Morris family, and he could even be compared with Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bruno was a true genius who had developed his potential to the extreme.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this time, Bruno received a message. It was a video sent by Karl, showing the fighting process of Alexander against Frederick. No one knew how Mafia got it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After watching that, Bruno showed a solemn expression.</span></p><div class="pagination">
