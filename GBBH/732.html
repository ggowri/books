  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yinson gave Blaze the order to capture a patient infected with poison and send the patient to the Sakra Society.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were infected people all over Loscity, and Blaze could have captured one and shipped the person out through a special channel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Blaze's target was Jeff, who was going to be infected with plague and sent </span><span>to Risun's research center.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blaze smiled cheerfully at the thought of the tragic fate Jeff was about to face, looking quite smug and excited.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melin would definitely be heartbroken when Jeff disappeared. At that time, Blaze was going to take advantage of the situation and play his tricks to get Melin for sure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Melin, even though you cruelly rejected me, how can I stand you being with another man?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Especially Jeff. He's just an ordinary police officer. How is he worthy of you? How does he deserve such a pretty and noble woman like you?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Jeff, you have to disappear!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blaze whispered like a madman as he followed Jeff closely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was nervous because he was about to do it, his body trembling uncontrollably.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had a syringe hidden in his pocket with the blood he had taken from his patient. As soon as he pumped the blood into Jeff, Jeff could instantly be infected with plague.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After that, he would send Jeff to the designated place, and he would never come back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Beck, I have a little problem. Can you help me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blaze caught up with Jeff to ask.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He gave a gentle smile, looking innocent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeff smiled as soon as he saw it was Blaze, "Dr. Bates, never mind. Just tell me if there's anything, and I'll definitely help you out."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's great!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blaze patted Jeff's shoulder. It did help that he'd purposely gotten on Jeff's good side during this time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "Jeff's an idiot!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blaze despised Jeff in his mind, but his smile was cordial.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Beck, we got a batch of specific medicine in our hospital, and I heard it's very useful for the patients, but I can't move it all by myself. Can you help me carry it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Specific medicine? That's great!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeff was instantly excited.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dr. Bates, wait for me. I'll hurry up and call for help."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blaze hurriedly tugged at him and spoke helplessly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We can't tell anyone. After all, this batch of specific medicine isn't much, and if everyone knew about it, it would definitely cause looting and lead to a riot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So it's just the two of us going to carry it. Only you and me will know about this."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeff nodded repeatedly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Right. Dr. Bates, you're right, let's go move it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeff couldn't wait to rush Blaze as he wanted to settle this plague sooner rather than later.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't rush. Take it easy."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blaze was in no hurry. If he hadn't worn a protective mask, his eerie and creepy expression would have freaked Jeff out for sure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two went to the underground parking lot of the hospital after getting on the elevator.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dr. Bates, where's the medicine?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Beck, take it easy. We can never let anyone see it, or we'll cause a ruckus."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After exiting the elevator, Blaze looked around cautiously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The underground parking lot was already full of cars. It was silent without a soul in sight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blaze had planned for today's action for a long time, and he had chosen a blind side where no one would ever know.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's the car, over here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blaze pointed to the white pickup truck in the corner.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He opened the trunk, which was dark and stacked with several large cardboard boxes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Beck, please carry it. It's a little heavy."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blaze smiled and pointed to the cardboard boxes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeff got excited, and he hurriedly leaned over to hug the cardboard box.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He exclaimed in surprise as the cardboard box was so light that he picked it up in one go.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeff was puzzled as he opened the cardboard box to see that it was actually empty with nothing inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dr. Bates, what's going on? Where's the specific medicine?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeff asked Blaze when he turned around in surprise. A man dressed in black made a fist towards him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As a result, a black shadow accompanied by a strong wind came crashing down heavily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeff covered his head in severe pain, and his eyes glazed over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Immediately afterward, Jeff felt another sharp pain in his neck, and he could no longer stay awake and felt very dizzy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he fell heavily, Blaze opened his mask, looking hideous and terrifying.</span></p><div class="pagination">
