  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander thought, "What a powerful roar! The Dominion Church indeed is a place where hidden masters lay in wait."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander observed the priests who had stepped forward. Just by sensing their presence, he could tell they were at least level-two warriors, perhaps even level-three.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The middle-aged priestly soldier said coldly, "You have already signed the life-and-death waiver. From this moment on, your fate is your own. Some of you may have heard of the Outer Court selection for lay disciples of the Dominion Church revolves around the Thunderclap Bronze Men.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As long as you can pass through the corridor they guarded within half an hour, you will officially become a lay disciple.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"These Thunderclap Bronze Men are forged from refined bronze. Blessed by sacred energy, they are granted a flicker of sentience. Their strength is boundless, their endurance endless. Their strikes are swift as lightning, their punches like rolling thunder. Their bodies are as hard as diamonds, and blades and spears cannot harm them. They rival even level-three warriors. Consider yourselves warned."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd erupted into chatter. "No wonder only one in ten thousand makes it through! But even if I fail, I won't starve when I go back."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My senior attempted it last time. He said those Bronze Men are terrifying."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Silence!" The middle-aged priest's expression turned ice-cold as he scanned the murmuring candidates. "What's wrong? Are you afraid? Do you think martial arts is just about learning a few fancy moves? That it's a path to wealth and glory? A shortcut to power and prestige? No! True martial arts exist to protect the nation and to vanquish all evil!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was stunned by the priest's words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The path of martial arts was not one of luxury, nor was it a road to power. It was a journey of hardship that demanded perseverance and unwavering courage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only through countless trials and tribulations could one truly forge themselves into something greater. That was the essence of martial arts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although blessed by Spiritual Awakening and possessing heightened intelligence, Alexander had never received proper guidance. But now, hearing these words, he finally understood what had driven him all this time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't just about surviving in this world. It wasn't just about making a name for himself. It was about protecting the nation and to vanquish all evil.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's blood burned with newfound determination, and his fighting spirit soared. For a fleeting moment, he wished he could instantly ascend to a level-five warrior, strong enough to defend the nation against the undead and eradicate evil.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The middle-aged priest called out, "Who will go first?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I will! I'm Sellers Schneier." The refined young noble took a few steps and arrived in front of the vermilion doorway of the main hall, flashing inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Sellers crossed the threshold, he found himself standing in a long, winding corridor illuminated by bright lanterns with arrow markings glowing faintly on the walls to guide the way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The corridor was barely ten feet wide and about 15 feet high. Not far ahead stood a towering bronze figure over 6.5 feet tall, its entire body radiating a golden brilliance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Bronze Man resembled a giant cast in metal, formidable and imposing. It exuded a vibe of pure ferocity, sharpness, and undeniable dominance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sellers was startled. "The Schneier Spear Technique, Serpent Strikes!" Like a serpent slithering through the grass, he shot forward. He took a turn and was already upon the Bronze Men's ribs in the blink of an eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the Bronze Man's reaction was terrifyingly swift. It hurtled its massive arms straight toward Sellers' temples.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sellers knew better than to take the hit head-on. He stopped and twisted his body, tapped his toes, and his whole body instantly soared into the air, rushing towards the top of the Bronze Man's head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Bronze Man stomped, and the long corridor shook. It jumped up as well, its left hand forming an eagle's claw, grabbing towards Sellers' throat. Sellers seemed doomed to be seized in its iron grip.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, Sellers let out a shout. A surge of Force circulated throughout his body, performing an impossible move. He turned and twisted his body mid-air, escaping the Bronze Man's eagle claw. He passed over its head and landed a dozen feet behind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sellers had already passed over the Brone Man's head in a flash, and it seemed he was about to succeed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Sellers suddenly felt a great motion behind him, and an icy chill instantly enveloped his body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this time, it was too late to dodge. Sellers had to urge the Force of his whole body to protect his back and forcibly endure the Bronze Man's blow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a loud bang, Sellers flew forward like a kite with a broken string.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mid-flight, Sellers coughed up a mouthful of blood, using the momentum to propel himself toward the corridor's far end.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Strangely enough, after Sellers left the Bronze Man by a hundred feet, it did not chase after him but merely returned to its original stance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sellers dared not look back. He burned through his remaining energy to reach the exit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone in the hall felt that only a short time had passed, and Sellers came out of a black door on the right side of the hall. He spat out a mouthful of blood before he collapsed into unconsciousness.</span></p><div class="pagination">
