  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rebecca woke up, her face flushed as she took in the scene before her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not one to be left out, she leaned in, eagerly licking and savoring the moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was thrilled, commanding the three of them to kneel before him, their backs arched high, presenting themselves for his pleasure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The alluring moans filled the bedroom...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't until three hours later that the room fell silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The three beauties were exhausted and fast asleep, but Alexander was still brimming with energy, his body charged with the Force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, his phone vibrated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With some effort, Alexander disentangled himself from Ava's embrace, freeing one hand to answer the call. The other continued to roam freely over Lynn's ample bosom, teasing and squeezing at will.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava clung to him tightly, like a languid kitten devoid of strength, pressed against him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Xavier on the line. A sense of foreboding washed over Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Had something happened in Mandale Town?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mandale Town was the source of his most valuable gemstones, and he couldn't afford any mishaps.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander quickly sat up, answering the call.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, it's Xavier. The Axe has been hit!" came Xavier's panicked voice over the phone, his tone tense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander soothed him. "Take your time. Tell me what happened at the Axe."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Had the Axe turned against him?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A cold glint flickered in Alexander's eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alyssa and Beverly were in charge of Mandale Town.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They shipped a crate of high-grade gems from there every month, along with </span><span>hundreds of millions in dividends.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander needed those gems to continue upgrading his Lightsaber.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, the Mafia and City of Sorcery have joined forces and launched a surprise attack on Mandale Town. The Axe has suffered heavy losses, and Alyssa has been captured by City of Sorcery, her whereabouts unknown! If it weren't for Beverly's timely intervention, Mandale Town would have been completely out of control."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Xavier was clearly anxious, indicating that Mandale Town was on the brink of disaster.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's anger flared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Mafia and City of Sorcery again! Those damned wizards! I haven't even had the chance to settle scores with them for all the deaths they've caused. And now they dare to attack Mandale Town. How despicable! When did Alyssa go missing?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Three hours ago. The Axe lost over a hundred men. Fortunately, Beverly's support caught the Mafia off guard, so Mandale Town is still under our control. But with Alyssa captured, the morale of the Axe is at an all-time low. I'm afraid only you can resolve this situation."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Xavier pleaded for Alexander to go to Mandale Town, seeing him as omnipotent in his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander agreed without hesitation, "Alright, Mandale Town is crucial. I'm on my way."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Great!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Alexander's confirmation, Xavier finally felt relieved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As long as Alexander took personal action, the Mafia and the wizards wouldn't stand a chance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava, nestled in Alexander's arms, heard every word. Her desire, which had just flared up, cooled rapidly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I have to go to Mandale Town right away. Stay safe. I've already discussed this with the Ultimate Alliance. Charlize and Rosalia will be protecting you and Ashley around the clock."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was meticulous with his instructions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava immediately furrowed her brow, whispering, "Is Loscity still in danger?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander hesitated for a moment, deciding not to mention the living dead. It was something people wouldn't believe unless they saw it with their own eyes, and it would only cause panic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, it's related to Risun's Sakra Society. But for now, Sakra Society shouldn't be able to affect Loscity. I've ordered Augusta to bring a thousand elite from Treasure Island to protect you. I'll be gone for three days at most. I'll return as soon as I can!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava had never seen Alexander so cautious, and she immediately became alert.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Go ahead to Mandale Town with peace of mind. I'll organize the Saint Group's security, ready to face any danger."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander patted her derriere.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Make sure they carry weapons at all times. If we can prepare some heavy firepower, the more, the better."</span></p><div class="pagination">
