  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get out of my way. I'm looking for someone!" Alexander's tone was calm yet firm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The leader of the group was momentarily taken aback, then anger flared in his eyes. "Do you know where you are? This is the Miranda Hotel. You must have a death wish coming here and causing trouble."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Time was running short, and Alexander didn't have the patience for a confrontation. Every minute wasted could mean danger for Madelyn. "Move aside!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a powerful shout, he charged forward like a freight train. Several burly men were knocked to the ground, bruised and dazed by the impact.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The leader, wiping blood from his face, looked horrified. "Mr. Lewis, we've got a situation! We need backup now!" he urgently radioed for support, alerting a middle-aged man inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zachary Lewis, taking charge, ordered, "Get all security to the lobby immediately!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dozens of uniformed security guards quickly assembled. Alexander walked into the hall, unfazed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop right there!" Several guards, eager to impress Zachary, surrounded Alexander aggressively.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander glanced at them coolly. "If you don't want to leave on your own, you'll end up on the floor."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before the guards could react, Alexander struck them with swift, precise blows, leaving them unconscious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zachary's expression shifted. He recognized that this intruder was highly skilled. Turning to the older man beside him, Brian Turner, he asked, "Mr. Turner, what's your assessment of his strength?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though in his fifties or sixties with graying hair, Brian stood straight, his eyes sharp and his presence commanding&mdash;a clear indication of his mastery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He's just a fool who thinks he can throw his weight around here. He won't get far," Brian replied, dismissing Alexander with a contemptuous smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm here to find someone. Just tell me which room Marcos is in, and I won't cause any trouble," Alexander said, growing impatient.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian stood his ground, sneering, "We protect our guests at the Miranda Hotel. You </span><span>can't just waltz in here and demand answers."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's eyes flashed with determination. Without another word, he moved forward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop! Are you deaf?" Brian shouted, charging at Alexander with a powerful punch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To Alexander, Brian's attack was no more than a child's play. He was in a hurry to find Madelyn and had no interest in a drawn-out fight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I told you to move!" Alexander kicked Brian in the chest with lightning speed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian, unable to avoid the attack, flew backward and crashed into the wall with a loud thud.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The onlookers were stunned. Brian was Zachary's personal bodyguard, a champion in multiple fighting tournaments, yet he was easily defeated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander continued on his path, undeterred. Zachary, now sweating, ordered, "All of you, get him! A million dollars to whoever </span><span>takes</span><span> him down!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The security guards, initially intimidated, were spurred by the promise of a reward. Driven by greed, they charged at Alexander, hoping to overwhelm him with sheer numbers.</span></p><div class="pagination">
