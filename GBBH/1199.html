  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander paid no attention to Sienna or her group. Instead, he focused on comforting Ashley with gentle patience, gave Ava a warm embrace, and only then turned back to face Sienna with ice in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You harassed my woman and my daughter and then tried to attack me. So why wouldn't I beat you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Alexander spoke, he began walking toward Sienna.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each unhurried step was like a hammer blow to her already frayed nerves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stay back! What do you think you're doing?" Her voice rose in panic. "I'm Sienna Rhodes of the </span><span>Newbrook</span><span> Rhodes family. Don't you dare lay another hand on me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A contemptuous smile crossed Alexander's face as he continued his advance, completely unfazed by her threats.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop right there! How dare you hit Ms. Rhodes, you bastard!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The security guards finally snapped into action, moving to block Alexander's path. They had failed in their duty to protect Sienna and were desperate to make amends.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Teach him a lesson! Beat him up!" Sienna </span><span>screamed,</span><span> her face contorted with rage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The other women joined in, berating the security guards. "What are you waiting for? He just hit Sienna! Get him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Slap their face&mdash;him, that woman, and the kid!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The guards, fueled by the women's demands, charged at Alexander with renewed vigor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But despite being outnumbered, Alexander viewed them as nothing more than insects beneath his feet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't even bother to move as they approached, a contemptuous smile on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One guard managed to land a solid punch to Alexander's chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His triumphant grin lasted only a split second before excruciating pain shot through </span><span>his arm. The force of hitting Alexander's chest had ricocheted back through his own limb.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Argh!" The guard collapsed to the ground, clutching his mangled right hand, writhing in agony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The other bodyguards joined in, raining blows on Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet he stood there like a statue, making no move to fight back, simply taking their assault in silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But everyone who struck him paid a steep price. Their attacks seemed to rebound with devastating force&mdash;hands snapped, feet fractured, leaving them either writhing on the ground in agony or curled up like wounded animals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In reality, their blows never truly connected. Alexander's body was surrounded by an invisible force field, and when mere mortals tried to breach it, the consequences were brutal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What the hell is this guy made of, steel?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Motherfucker, he can't be human!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The women backed away in terror.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander ignored them completely, continuing his slow, deliberate advance toward Sienna.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop him! Somebody </span><span>stop</span><span> him! What are you all waiting for? Do something!" Sienna's voice cracked with panic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The heavyset woman had managed to get back on her feet. She circled behind Alexander, grabbed a microphone stand from the stage, and swung it at him with all her might.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The stand shattered against Alexander's body like glass hitting concrete.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The woman screamed in pain, blood streaming from her hands where the metal had torn into them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander halted, fixing the heavyset woman with an icy stare.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She began trembling uncontrollably and stumbled backward in terror, losing her balance and tumbling off the stage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd erupted into chaos once again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The audience was stunned by the handsome young man's composure. Despite being surrounded by multiple attackers, he handled the situation with remarkable ease.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were also disgusted, even outraged, by Sienna's group's tyrannical and shameless behavior.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Sienna was scrambling backward, her face contorted with fear and malice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Someone </span><span>protect</span><span> me! Don't let him near me!" she yelled. "I'll pay a million dollars to whoever breaks his legs. And I'll even be your girlfriend!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Faced with Alexander's overwhelming presence, Sienna had completely lost her composure, resorting to using money and her looks to entice help.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her offer immediately sparked excitement among several men in the crowd below.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was their chance to get in Sienna's good graces. If they succeeded, they'd get both money and a beautiful girlfriend.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Rhodes, are you serious about that offer?" a burly man called out, already </span><span>cracking his knuckles in anticipation. "The million dollars and being your boyfriend&mdash;that's a real promise?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sienna continued sweetening the deal, trying to entice someone to help her. "I swear I'm telling the truth! Break his legs, and I'll make your dreams come true.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll get the best lawyers to protect you. You won't go to jail for breaking his legs&mdash;you'll just become my boyfriend."</span></p><div class="pagination">
