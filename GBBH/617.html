  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Alexander glanced around, most of the ore appeared as nothing more than dull, lifeless masses, clearly devoid of precious gems&mdash;mere waste.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, those concealing hidden treasures glimmered with a distinct light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander casually picked up a few more samples and inspected them closely with his All-seeing Eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The brighter the ore appeared, the higher the likelihood it contained a gemstone upon being cut open.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Olivia, visibly nervous, whispered, "These are all Mafia guys. They're hosting an auction."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander chuckled reassuringly. "Don't worry, even if they spot you, with me here, they can't lay a finger on you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Olivia felt a slight relief and then expressed her concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stone speculation is expensive. It's a gamble, nine are deceptions out of ten bets. The Mafia organizes such transactions to make money. To win in stone speculation, luck is a must."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander grinned confidently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the All-seeing Eyes, any ore containing gems stood no chance of escaping his scrutiny.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, a sharp, catty voice called out, "Well, well, if it isn't Olivia?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Whitlock, look who it is&mdash;it's Olivia! She dares to show up here? Quite the death wish, isn't it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Olivia turned to see, and her previously rosy cheeks were now pale.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander spun around to find a provocatively dressed, alluring woman, her arm looped around the arm of a dapper young man, glaring maliciously at Olivia and him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This heavily made-up woman wore a skirt so short it barely covered her hips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite her glittering accessories, she exuded no grace; instead, a whiff of a loose woman permeated the air around her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Morton Whitlock, having allied himself with the Mafia, had seized Olivia's father's exchange. Moreover, he had his sights set on Olivia, though she had managed to escape him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, at the sight of Olivia with another man, Morton's eyes practically burned with fury, his face darkening with resentment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The woman he coveted hadn't just fled&mdash;she had returned with another man, blatantly disregarding his very existence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Olivia, now that I'm in charge of the exchange, is this man even a match for me? If you stay with me, I could save your life, yet you refuse?" Morton glared at Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander, with a hand casually resting on Olivia's waist, smirked disdainfully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We're here for stone speculation. Are you going to tarnish the Mafia's reputation in front of everyone?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The woman scoffed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Olivia, where did you dig up this guy? Dressed so plainly&mdash;stone speculation typically costs hundreds of thousands of dollars. Do you even have that much?" she taunted mercilessly, emboldened by Morton's presence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander stared icily at her, thinking, "This woman is asking for death!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Olivia snapped, "Sandy, shut your mouth! You sleaze, if not for your conniving, my father wouldn't have been swallowed up by the Mafia!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sandy flushed but sneered. "Your father was just being stubborn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Mafia acquiring his exchange was a compliment, yet he foolishly refused."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Morton sneered at Alexander, saying, "You're here for stone speculation?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fine, then I'll take your money before ending you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His expression twisted with jealousy over Olivia's new companion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though Sandy was attractive, she was no match for the refined beauty of Olivia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Morton confidently waved a hand. "Guys, follow them. Bring them to me after the auction ends."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sandy gleefully said, "Exactly, drain their funds first, then make them pay!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander said, "Let's go take a look over there."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Olivia in his arms, Alexander completely ignored Morton, treating him as though he were invisible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Olivia agreed, and they turned to leave together.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Morton's expression froze as he thought, "Olivia is a stubborn lass. She's so obedient to that man&mdash;could they have slept together already?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This thought sent a surge of jealousy through him, making his body tremble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the very center of the hall stood a massive ore block, nearly the height of a person.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was already surrounded by a crowd, particularly jewelers and seasoned stone speculators, all pointing and murmuring about the rock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This ore block was the focal point of the stone speculation event.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It had several small holes drilled into it, through which one could see what seemed like a dazzling array of gemstones, giving off a crystalline, translucent glow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Typically, such a premium ore block had a high likelihood of containing good gems or even top-grade gems.</span></p><div class="pagination">
