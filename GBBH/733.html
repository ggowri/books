Why did you do that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Humph! Why?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blaze grinned as he took the syringe out of his pocket and stuck it hard into Jeff's body. He injected a tube of poisoned blood all the way in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why are you so ashamed to ask me why? Melin belongs to me, so who are you to seduce her? Don't blame me, and you brought this on yourself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry, I will get her pregnant and take good care of her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Asshole! Blaze, you're such an animal. Unfortunately, I'm not..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Jeff could finish his sentence, Blaze slammed him with a stick.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeff couldn't withstand the blow anymore, and he couldn't even utter a single word.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes widened with pain, hatred, and deep despair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A strong desire to survive made him turn and look in the direction of the elevator, struggling to climb over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you want to escape? Can you get away?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blaze smiled smugly and hit Jeff in the knee with a stick.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a crisp crack of bone, Jeff passed out completely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blaze grunted disdainfully and hurriedly tied Jeff up, taping his mouth shut and tossing him into the trunk of the car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ha-ha-ha, Melin will be mine from now on!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blaze laughed excitedly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He started the car and quickly left the hospital, driving towards the appointment for the handover.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Alexander was immediately preparing the antidote.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Charlize and Rosalia guarded the door, not allowing anyone to enter, including Ava.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In order to relieve everyone in Loscity of their poison, they would need more than a little antidote.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander prepares a huge porcelain tub filled with crushed powder. Then, he crushed up Heaven's Grass and added it to the mix.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Underneath the tub, Alexander carved a magic circle according to the records in the inheritance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dozens of formation gems were set underneath. He could strengthen the flame energy through this magic circle, raising the temperature of a normal natural gas stove fire by several times.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a boom, blue flames erupted from the gas stove. After being enhanced by the magic circle, it quickly turned purple.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The purple flame exuded a terrifyingly high temperature, and the medicinal powder quickly melted in the porcelain tub, gradually turning into a dark medicinal liquid.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander hurriedly output the Force, using it to protect the porcelain tub, controlling the temperature of the medicinal powders and preventing them from catching fire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the regulation of the Force, even under the heat of thousands of degrees Fahrenheit, the various medicinal powders were perfectly mixed together and were not burnt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After being baked by the flame, the impurities in it evaporated and solidified into black crystals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As time passed by, dozens of herbs converged and condensed into crystals of various sizes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander let out a deep sigh of relief, and he hadn't failed after all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>An hour had passed before he realized it, and Alexander had refined out a dozen pounds of antidote crystals of various sizes and shapes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although it was only an hour, Alexander was exhausted from his constant output of the Force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He immediately asked Ava and Lynn to come in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava and Lynn thought there had been an accident, so they rushed in impatiently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon after, Rosalia and Charlize, who were guarding the doorway, heard the sound of moaning and screaming coming from inside the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Charlize looked shocked as he whispered, "Isn't Ava Lynn's daughter? Are the three of them doing it together?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosalia rolled her eyes at her in displeasure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What are you so surprised about? They've been together for a long time. You don't live at the villa, so of course you don't know it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Charlize stared at Rosalia with her jaw dropped in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosalia smiled helplessly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's wrong? What did you want to say? Anyway, Ms. Blackburn did it willingly, even as she made Mr. Hawthorne and Lynn get together."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Charlize couldn't believe it was true, but the facts were in front of her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But they are mother and daughter! Are both of them in love with Mr. Hawthorne? What will happen then? Won't they get married?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosalia smiled, "Wouldn't it be better if Mr. Hawthorne didn't marry? We could also be with him, and we should thank God for that."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey! You're right. Mr. Hawthorne is so fond of Ava that he's sure to marry, but with Lynn involved, I'm not so sure."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Charlize was surprised and delighted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosalia sighed softly, "Mr. Hawthorne is the best man in the world. There are too many women who love him."</span></p><div class="pagination">
