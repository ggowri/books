  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The streets were a pitiful sight, with crumbling buildings, heaps of filthy trash, and sewage running openly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The air itself was thick with a rancid, sour stench.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Occasionally, stray cats and dogs darted out from the garbage piles, either scavenging for food or fighting fiercely.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander felt a heavy weight in his chest. He was taken aback to see the elite Phantom Squad members reduced to such dire circumstances because of corrupt higher-ups.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He sighed deeply, reflecting on how these battle-hardened soldiers seemed to be the victims of a cruel twist of fate.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Augusta, limping on his injured leg, led the way with an air of eagerness. Alexander and his party soon arrived at a trash recycling center.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Piles of garbage loomed like small hills beside a rundown wooden shack.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Inside, Alexander saw two men and a woman seated, exchanging greetings with Augusta.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He felt a surge of relief.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Though these three were shabby and worn, with expressions marked by pain, they exuded an unmistakable aura of strength.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Their bodies were still robust, their eyes sharp like hawks, revealing a palpable sense of danger&mdash;they were clearly seasoned warriors.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As Augusta spoke, the trio looked at Alexander with a mix of curiosity and shock.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Despite this being their first meeting, they felt a tangible pressure and a sense of threat from the young man, akin to facing a formidable adversary in the middle of a mission.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Augusta explained, "This is Alexander Hawthorne, Mr. Hawthorne. He's willing to hire us with a generous salary. I've already pledged my life to the boss. Since you're my brother-in-arms, I wanted to get your thoughts.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If you're on board, we'll fight together again and build something new with the boss!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Augusta had a knack for oratory; with just a few words, he managed to lay everything out clearly and with an inspiring touch.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The three stood up, their expressions shifting from shock to excitement and joy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">One bald man tried to speak but was overcome with tears.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Once proud and elite, they had long been discarded and left in the shadows, their former glory tarnished.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The injustice and sadness they had endured were beyond ordinary endurance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander's voice was resolute. "As long as you're with me, you're my brothers, through thick and thin, in life and death."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Their faces lit up with fervor, their lips trembling with emotion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">They saw Alexander as a compassionate, humble, and strong leader who genuinely wanted to help them and believed in them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The bald man was the first to speak up, "I'm Marvin Streep, and I'm ready to follow the boss into any danger!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'm Logan Ridley, and I'm ready to follow without fear!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'm Charlize Collins, and I pledge my life in loyalty!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The others followed suit, and Augusta joined them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">All four bowed their heads before Alexander, their proud spirits humbled by their experiences and their willingness to serve.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Excellent!" Alexander said, clearly pleased.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His private force had just grown considerably.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With William and these four former Phantom Squad members fully armed, he now had a formidable team.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Billy stood by, watching with growing respect for Alexander.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With a wave of his hand, Alexander ordered, "Let's go. I'll arrange new accommodations for you. Leave everything here behind; I'll get you new stuff."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Logan's face lit up with a broad smile, the scar on his face twisting with joy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"This is fantastic. Thanks to the boss, I'm finally getting out of here!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Marvin grinned widely, his white teeth flashing as he laughed. "Ha! With a salary between 500 thousand dollars and a million dollars, I'd need to find a lot of women to spend all that!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Charlize rolled her eyes at him. "With the amount of time you spend in bed, two or three minutes at most, how many women do you really think you can handle?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Marvin retorted, "Don't push your luck just because you're a woman. You think I won't knock you around?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The group burst into laughter, the tension from earlier melting away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander had Billy arrange for a rental house on the outskirts of Bevery Hills to accommodate Augusta and his team.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This was a fresh start for them, and he was keen to keep it under wraps. He didn't want Ava and Anne to find out and risk the wrath of that Godfather dad he had yet to meet.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Once the four were settled in temporarily, Alexander prepared to tend to their injuries.</p><div class="pagination">
