  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Congratulations, Ms. Baird. I'm willing to pay out five million dollars to congratulate the City of Sorcery for having a new owner!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Yes. I will also donate five million dollars to congratulate the City of Sorcery on its centenary anniversary."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ms. Baird, you're truly a heroine. We admire you very much!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>These people were smart. They immediately showed their loyalty, presented gifts, and flattered Yvonne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yvonne remained silent, her expression dignified, but she was excited in her heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Power tasted so good, like the best beauty medicine in the world, making Yvonne bright and beautiful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In a vast underground base in the Risun, Yinson, Brandon, and Salman Bowen, a man with a mustache in a military uniform, were holding an emergency meeting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Brandon held a cigar in his mouth and frowned. "According to reliable intelligence, Alexander has become Heinrich's only heir. Now, he has obtained Treasure Island and controls the City of Sorcery. We are in big trouble!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yinson added, "Not only that, Loscity is entirely controlled by Alexander. The Ultimate Alliance he founded has now established an alliance with significant forces such as The Kaylon and is expanding outward rapidly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"General Bowen, if this continues, our Sakra Society will lose its presence in Loscity, and I'm afraid we won't even have a foothold in the entire empire."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Salman narrowed his eyes slightly, and his eyes looked fierce.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. White, how is the progress of the 'Apocalypse Project' that we Risun military is cooperating with you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yinson suddenly became excited, and he quickly waved to Elaine standing next to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Dr. Bell, please report our progress to the General Bowen."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Elaine smiled sweetly, twisted her hips, and came to Salman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She leaned over and said gently, "General Bowen, please allow me to report to you in detail."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Salman stared at Elaine's plump and charming breasts. They were fully displayed in front of him through the neckline.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He knew that Elaine was seducing him. Suddenly, he was filled with desire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Salman thought, "This woman is so coquettish!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Elaine said, "General Bowen, we extracted a mysterious poison from the samples collected from the Loscity plague and then combined it with the power elixir developed by the Red Umbrella Group to create the Apocalypse elixir.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Please look at the humans who have been injected with Apocalypse elixir. Even corpses can be resurrected. They all have eternal life, powerful strength, agility, and are bloodthirsty. They have no sense of pain and are not afraid of death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"We call them the living dead. The only drawback is that they have no intelligence. But we can implant chips in their heads to command them."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As Elaine spoke, she turned on the LCD screen and played the surveillance video footage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Inside several sturdy steel cages, terrifying humanoid monsters were imprisoned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>These monsters still retained their human form, but their bodies were highly decayed. Their fingers were thin, black, and sharp, and their mouths were full of sharp fangs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Elaine pressed a remote control.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, all the living dead roared at the same time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Elaine then used the remote control to control the living dead, turning left and turning right. She even gave some attack orders.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The zombie's shriveled, pitch-black ten fingers clawed frantically at the air, opening their horrifyingly large mouths to bite everywhere.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Well, you did a great job!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Salman slammed the table excitedly and stood up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Brandon was stunned. It was his first time to see the living dead. Even though he was ruthless and had seen countless things, it was the first time he saw such a horrifying scene.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He murmured, "Devil... It is the real devil coming to the world!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Elaine said proudly, "General Bowen, give me another half a year at most, and I will eliminate the side effects of the Apocalypse elixir. By then, those who have been injected with the Apocalypse elixir will obtain a powerful body that is immortal, as well as a high IQ that surpasses all other creatures!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Great!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Salman waved his fist excitedly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"We will stand at the top of the world. We are the best nation!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this time, Yinson patted Brandon on the shoulder, scaring him so much that he shivered, and his cigar fell to the ground.</span></p><div class="pagination">
