Their enthusiasm reignited as they eagerly supported Alexander's proposal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Brilliant Group? Who cares about them!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We're done with them! We'll follow the Saint Group's lead from now on."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>People crowded around Ava, each one hoping to secure a position as a magic powder distributor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian's entire body trembled with rage. The Brilliant Group had never faced such open humiliation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, if you think you can take down the Brilliant Group with magic powder alone, you're deluding yourself!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Listen up, everyone! A hundred million dollars to whoever </span><span>captures</span><span> that bastard Alexander!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The unprecedented reward fired up the members of the Brilliant Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Within moments, hundreds of them surged forward, closing in from all directions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They wore matching black suits, carrying various weapons as they marched forward, exuding an ominous intensity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava shouted furiously, "Sebastian, this is </span><span>Loscity</span><span>. Don't think you can just run wild here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian sneered, knowing that capturing Alexander and seizing the magic powder formula was his only hope to turn the tide.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking over his army, Sebastian felt a surge of pride and confidence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sebastian, do you think The Cripples are just here for show? If you dare harm Mr. Hawthorne, we'll make sure you're wiped out!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Houtte</span><span> roared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At his command, over a hundred members of The Cripples emerged from every street and alley, brawny men clad in black leather jackets adorned with gleaming silver accessories.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They wielded machetes, metal pipes, chains, and shotguns as they flooded in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Mary nonchalantly made a call.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not long after, the Blood Gang joined the fray.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though they were only about a hundred strong, each member was fearsome, emanating a deadly aura.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The scars and hardened calluses on their hands testified to their experience and status as Blood Gang's true elite.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Oscar casually clapped his hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Within seconds, gunmen appeared on the rooftops of several nearby buildings, their barrels trained on the Brilliant Group's forces below.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One by one, the major players issued orders, sending shockwaves across </span><span>Loscity</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The four great families, the Hansen family, the Federer family, the Clifford family, and the Dominguez family, alongside eight prominent corporations and over a dozen powerful organizations, all deployed their forces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In no time, the convention center was packed with thousands, encircling Sebastian and the Brilliant Group's couple hundred members completely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian was under immense pressure. Alexander's forces were vast, looming like an unstoppable storm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His mind went blank, and his breath caught as tension nearly paralyzed him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew that if Alexander gave the command, there would be no escape for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Time seemed to stretch endlessly, or maybe it passed in a flash; he couldn't tell anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's gaze swept over the Brilliant Group members. He saw the fear etched deeply onto their faces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Trembling, they looked away, avoiding Alexander's eyes, too terrified to meet his stare.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian glared at Alexander with resentment, gritting his teeth. "Alexander, if you dare harm me, Guzman won't let you get away with it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smirked dismissively.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Haven't I already hurt you? What's one more time?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he finished, Alexander seemed to vanish on the spot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian blinked, and in that instant, Alexander appeared before him, striking down with one swift motion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian's screams echoed as he crumpled to the ground, clutching his head in agony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander had reactivated the sliver of energy he'd planted in Sebastian's mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll give you three more days. If you don't reveal Guzman's whereabouts by then, prepare to meet your end.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now get lost!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Alexander kicked Sebastian, sending him sprawling across the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The members of the Brilliant Group were furious, their faces dark with anger, yet none dared to step forward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Silently, they picked up Sebastian and fled with tails between their legs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Max watched Alexander let Sebastian go so easily, feeling deeply dissatisfied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He turned to Ava, pressing, "Ms. Blackburn, are we really just going to let them leave like that? Shouldn't we take this chance to finish them off? Alexander didn't even consult with you. Isn't he being too arrogant?"</span></p><div class="pagination">
