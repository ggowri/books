  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's wrong? Why are you looking at me like that... You'll have to make me the head of the family before I give you my </span><span>first time</span><span>. For now, we can just kiss and hug."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blushing, </span><span>Lara</span><span> shot Alexander a glance. Men are all the same.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you having severe insomnia lately? Also stressed, causing your menstrual cycle to go off balance?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's words were shockingly accurate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How... how did you know that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That, I'm not telling you." Alexander smiled, keeping the wonders of his Force Sense hidden from </span><span>Lara</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, he reached out and massaged </span><span>Lara</span><span>'s chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A surge of the Force entered her, and instantly, </span><span>Lara</span><span> felt revitalized, with all traces of fatigue gone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lara</span><span> said excitedly, "Your skills are amazing. I feel so much better. How about taking some time to give me a full-body check-up?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander almost </span><span>spat</span><span> out </span><span>the</span><span> drink.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't get the wrong idea. I'm just asking for a check-up, not inviting you to bed." Embarrassed, </span><span>Lara</span><span> covered her flushed cheeks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander chuckled bitterly. "I'm still a man. Don't tempt me like that, or things might really get out of hand."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without waiting for </span><span>Lara</span><span>'s response, he got up and walked out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop following me. I don't like clingy women."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she watched Alexander's back, </span><span>Lara</span><span>'s heart raced.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now I finally understand why Ava is so obsessed with this man. This is a real man&mdash;strong, humble, powerful, and classy."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She actually took Alexander's half-finished drink and slowly tasted it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, let's see if you're really a gentleman or just playing hard to get."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lara</span><span> pulled out her phone, scrolling through her private, sensual photos.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were shots from the bathtub, pool, living room, and on the couch... she had </span><span>plenty, all in various sexy outfits.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This one looks good. He should like it... hmm, this angle's nice too..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lara</span><span> felt her heart flutter as she became lost in her selection.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"All men love beautiful women, especially someone like me. There's no way he can resist!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as she was about to send Alexander a tempting picture, a young man approached her, saying warmly, "Hey beautiful, may I have the pleasure of buying you a drink?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Annoyed by the interruption, </span><span>Lara</span><span> snapped. "Leave me alone, get lost!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her icy tone made the man burn with anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, a tall figure in a black cloak appeared behind him, grabbing his shoulder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let go of me! What the hell, are you human or ghost, wearing a cloak at night&mdash;are you insane?" The man cursed as he reached to pull back the cloaked figure's hood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah!" A piercing scream rang out as the man's hand suddenly began to rot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Black blisters bubbled up on his arm, spreading rapidly over his body, even corroding his clothes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In mere seconds, his whole body was covered in black ulcers, oozing a dark liquid.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then suddenly, he collapsed heavily at the cloaked figure's feet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The whole bar was shocked. In just a few breaths, the man had dissolved into a pool of foul black liquid.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Demon!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Help!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Screams filled the room as people scrambled for the exits.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paralyzed with fear, </span><span>Lara</span><span> sank weakly into her chair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The cloaked figure stood before her</span><span>. His </span><span>half of an ugly, aged face </span><span>lied </span><span>visible under the hood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Drake smirked. "So, just like Ava, you're also one of Alexander's women? Tough luck. You're coming with me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next second, </span><span>Lara</span><span> was knocked out as Drake threw her over his shoulder and strode out of the bar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By now, Alexander had been driving away for a while.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A black Cadillac followed him like a ghost.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the passenger seat sat a man, a twisted scar running from his brow to the corner of his mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The scarred man ordered the driver coldly. "Catch up and ram him!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
