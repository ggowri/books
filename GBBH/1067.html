  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for Cyclops' Cadillac, because of its strong bulletproof surface, it managed to break out of the rain of bullets and ran away after knocking a car that got in its way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Crap!</span><span> Fuck!</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Trenton </span><span>was mad and wanted to</span><span> order his men to chase Cyclops</span><span>, but</span><span> Alexander stopped him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tell your men to take down the rest of his </span><span>thugs</span><span> in this building. </span><span>I'll handle </span><span>Cyclops."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, Alexander flashed dozens of </span><span>miles</span><span> away and soon got out of Trenton's sight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Trenton was simply dumbfounded and even forgot to follow his order.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a while, Trenton roughly rubbed his eyes and cursed with a horrified expression, "Fuck! Is he even a human being? Chase, don't blame me for not avenging you. I'm just too weak to offend a monster like Alexander."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Cyclops urged his driver,</span><span> Jet Gordon, </span><span>"Hurry! Speed up! We've rushed</span><span> out</span><span>, so don't let them </span><span>catch</span><span> up with us!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jet was also very excited about their survival and stepped hard on the accelerator. The Cadillac dashed forward like a </span><span>rocket</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Boss! Haha! </span><span>They lo</span><span>st</span><span> us! We're finally safe!" said </span><span>Jet</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cyclops also breathed a sigh of relief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, he gritted his teeth and said in profound hatred, "That goddamn Chase Burke. </span><span>He took so much </span><span>money</span><span> from me</span><span>, and he still attacked me. He will pay for this!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey! What is that?" Suddenly, Jet screamed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cyclops looked up and saw a man standing on the street ahead, walking towards their vehicle with his arms open.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The person getting in their way turned his back to a street lamp, which cast a shadow on his face, making Cyclops unable to see who he was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What an unlucky day! Since this loser wants to kill himself, just </span><span>hit </span><span>him</span><span> with the car</span><span>!" Cyclops ordered the driver fiercely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jet, originally intending to </span><span>step on the </span><span>brake, decided to keep on stepping on the accelerator after seeing this weird scene.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Cadillac's engine revved up, and it severely sped up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the roar of the engine, it </span><span>dashed out </span><span>but hit nothing</span><span>. It was like that man in front of their car was just an illusion</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's </span><span>the fuck </span><span>going on? Was there something wrong with my eyes?" Jet asked in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fuck! What the hell?"</span><span> </span><span>Cyclops looked very panicked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's that?!" Suddenly, a dark shadow appeared on the hood of the car and blocked Jet's view.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He</span><span> </span><span>freaked out </span><span>and </span><span>scream</span><span>ed</span><span>, and the car bumped into the green belts in jolts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cyclops realized it was an attack in a moment and pulled his gun to </span><span>shoot </span><span>that shadow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Within several seconds, he emptied his </span><span>bullets</span><span> and also broke the car windows. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, that shadow disappeared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Idiot! Stop the car!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cyclops shouted at Jet, but it was too late as the Cadillac crashed hard into a lamppost.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jet flew out of the broken car window and fell to the ground, </span><span>being un</span><span>conscious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Due to the huge inertia, Cyclops crashed hard into the car seat and bruised his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it! What kind of </span><span>monster</span><span> are you? Get out! I'll </span><span>kill you</span><span>!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cyclops was trembling as he reloaded his gun and provoked this mysterious enemy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next second, someone directly pulled the dented car door off, and Cyclops suddenly saw Alexander's mocking smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who</span><span> the hell</span><span> are you? What do you want?" He glared at Alexander in horror.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander just said calmly, "Due to Norma's </span><span>request</span><span>, I'm here to take Hazel back. By the way, do you </span><span>really </span><span>think you can escape after hurting </span><span>Hazel</span><span> and so many other women? I don't think </span><span>so</span><span>."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Go to hell!" Cyclops roared and fired at Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amid the fierce gunshots, Alexander disappeared again, and of course, all his bullets missed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this very moment, Cyclops was on the verge of losing his mind as he couldn't understand why this freak could dodge all his bullets with such incredible speed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, Cyclops heard himself letting out a scream. Alexander gripped his neck and pulled him out of the crushed car, and Cyclops also lost his gun.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a single hand, Alexander lifted him and gripped his neck harder and harder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As if there was an iron hoop around his neck, Cyclops felt his lungs were out of oxygen, and his face also turned purple.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said, "Um... Please..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite his struggle and desperate plea, Alexander just kept exerting more strength on his hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After flapping its limbs violently for a few seconds, Cyclops' head drooped and remained motionless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Snorting coldly, Alexander threw his </span><span>dead </span><span>body on the ground like garbage and directly walked away.</span></p><div class="pagination">
