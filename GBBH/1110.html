  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Howard's face turned ashen, and his whole body trembled with anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Lawson, weren't you always pursuing Ms. Lawson? Should we ask if she needs help?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The burly man asked cautiously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Shut up! Do you really not get it, or are you just that stupid?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Howard yelled angrily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You damn slut! You turn me down so many times. I actually thought you were shy, and now you're out here getting screwed in a car. Grace, you whore, I won't let you get away with this!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The bodyguard stood frozen, not knowing what to say.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ms. Lawson would actually fuck in a car!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"It's hard to imagine. Ms. Lawson, such a cold and proud woman, would do something like this."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As Howard listened to the bodyguard and the driver whispering, his eyes seemed to burn with fury, his fists clenched tightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander hadn't expected to run into Howard here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Being able to enjoy Grace's body in front of that brat Howard filled Alexander with a sense of superiority and satisfaction, making him even more excited.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Using the Force, Alexander pushed Grace to greater heights of pleasure. She was trembling with sensation, her body growing limp, and the car rocked more and more intensely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The bodyguards and driver dared not ask anything more, awkwardly looking away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Howard's face grew darker and darker, but he didn't dare to approach.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Humph! Let's see what kind of man this slut is with. It better not be Alexander."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Howard fumed. If it was Alexander, with the grudge over his broken leg, he'd make sure to get revenge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He dragged the others into the bushes and peeked from the shadows.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander couldn't help but laugh inwardly. He thought, "Just wait and see."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The car rocked for over an hour before finally stopping.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander gently held Grace, who was as limp as a doll, in his arms, tenderly caressing and kissing her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Grace was gasping for breath, completely unable to resist him but too exhausted to go on. She was too scared to let him do it again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Meanwhile, Howard, waiting in the bushes, had become stiff with anger, and the pain from his broken leg made his mood even worse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The bodyguards and driver whispered in shock and envy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Damn, it's been almost two hours! Ms. Lawson's man is really something. No wonder she likes him so much."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Yeah, he's like a Superman!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Shut up! What the hell are you talking about?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Howard shot them a glare.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The driver immediately fell silent, and the bodyguard quickly asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Lawson, should we go check out who that man is?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Howard gritted his teeth and waved his hand dismissively.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He wanted to go over and take a swing at that man, but remembering that Grace was the only heiress to the Lawson family, he knew he couldn't win against her. He would have to endure it for now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander continued to play with Grace, savoring her soft, full curves while keeping an eye on the movement of the spies hiding nearby.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Grace stared at Alexander in a daze, letting out a soft sigh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Don't worry. I won't go causing trouble for Ava anymore. I don't want to make you angry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I feel like I'm dreaming. I've never done anything so shameful before. It's all your fault.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Next time, don't do me like that. It's too dirty. That's where you pee, and my mouth is for eating, not for... doing that."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The more Grace spoke, the redder her face became.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander chuckled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"As long as you don't hold grudges, I won't get mad. You've never done this before, have you? But now, I'm your man, so you can do whatever you want. And I can see you really like it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Grace felt utterly embarrassed and slapped his chest hard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Pah! You pervert! You just like to degrade women."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She pulled her hand away from Alexander's, starting to adjust her clothes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her full, soft breasts moved as she shifted, and Alexander couldn't resist squeezing it again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Stop! I really can't handle it right now... next time... please..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Grace groaned, begging.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>To make Grace, usually so proud, beg like that, Alexander felt a rush of conquest deep inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then he gestured toward the window and said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Look over there. Howard and his guys are spying on us."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Grace turned to look, her face filled with both surprise and anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Damn it, Howard! How did he spot us? No!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander wasn't worried. He continued playing with Grace's full breasts, his tone casual.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What's there to worry about? Even if he saw us, it doesn't matter. The windows are one-way, so he can't see anything."</span></p><div class="pagination">
