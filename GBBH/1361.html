  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Some people were silent, some found it interesting, some laughed, and some sighed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander frowned, realizing he needed to get a handle on this sensing technique over the next few days instead of using it haphazardly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the Rectitude Hall of the Palace, Isolde cuddled up to Quinton, wrapping her arms around his and playfully pouting. "I want to go see the competition."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinton rubbed his forehead and replied, "Alright, go ahead. Just bring a few more guards along. There's no real danger at the Dominion Church!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isolde squealed with delight, hugging Quinton tightly and planting a kiss on his cheek. "Thank you, Dad!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, she spun around and bounced out of the hall, her heart racing at the thought of possibly facing Alexander again. Memories of the day he had carried her away made her cheeks flush.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinton watched Isolde leave, a bittersweet smile on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the morning of December 28th, the Dominion Church kicked off its annual competition. While the inner court event was closed to the public, anyone could attend the outer court competition, showcasing Hrodvik's commitment to martial arts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the middle of the outer courtyard's martial arts arena, three large arenas were constructed from thick trees, each measuring about 100 feet square. Gold, silver, and bronze medals adorned the pillars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Directly in front of the arenas stood a grand reviewing platform, where a large flag bearing the character "Martial" waved proudly atop a tall flagpole. Dozens of large chairs occupied the center of the arena, where several dignitaries sat, including the priests Huxley and Declan from the Dominion Church.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beside them were Madden, Fermin, Isolde, and other ministers. Surrounding the platform were soldiers and guards, creating a tense atmosphere.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The entire martial arts arena was packed with eager spectators, with vendors selling drinks, snacks, and treats. The air buzzed with chatter and excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I wonder who will take first place this time&mdash;there's a reward of 100,000 martial virtue points!" someone exclaimed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who's that stunning lady on the stage?" another asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's the King's thirteenth daughter, the most beloved princess!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the crowd, Alexander stared at Isolde from a distance, captivated. She had a delicate face. Dressed in a white dress paired with an red gauze top, she exuded both nobility and charm. His heart raced.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, a middle-aged man took the stage to announce the competition rules, his voice booming for all to hear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"All three arenas are fortified and incredibly sturdy. Competitors will be divided into groups based on their identity badges&mdash;gold, silver, and bronze. If you're knocked out of the ring or fall to the ground, you lose.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You may voluntarily challenge anyone on stage. If you win three consecutive matches, you'll get a five-minute break. Fighters within the same group can also invite you to battle. The competition lasts three days. The last person standing in each group will be awarded 100,000 martial virtue points, while the rest will be ranked based on wins and receive 50,000 martial virtue points."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once the man left the stage, the crowd began to murmur.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who's going to be the first one to challenge?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you're not at least 70-80% sure about taking first place, you wouldn't show up this early. Three whole days of competition!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I just want to enjoy the show and maybe make some money when the market opens!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Someone laughed. "You might not win even when the market opens!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Among the crowd, Sellers nudged Alexander, "Hey, Alexander! Are you going to compete?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander rolled his eyes. "My group is filled with level-four warriors. What can I do?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hogan shook his head. "So the silver badge isn't much better, then."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Enoch shot Hogan a sour look. "You're just jealous!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hogan glanced at Enoch and shook the tiger-head black gold spear in his hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"After these three days, I'll be a silver medalist! Just wait and see&mdash;I'm taking first place!" Hogan declared confidently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he lightly stepped onto the arena marked for bronze competitors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander and Logan cheered him on, "Go for it!" Vegeta and Nova joined in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the match began, a giant wielding a pair of six-sided copper hammers jumped onto the stage to challenge Hogan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hogan's black gold spear danced through the air, creating a flurry of pear blossoms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the hammer-wielding contender was no pushover either. He swung his hammers with such power that they created a whirlwind of motion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Logan, equipped with a combat power detector, shouted excitedly from the audience.</span></p><div class="pagination">
