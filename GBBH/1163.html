  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The room fell into dead silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the blink of an eye, Raymond was dead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carl and the remaining companions lay on the ground, their limbs crippled by Alexander. Even the slightest movement was now excruciating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn you," Carl cursed under his breath. Cold sweat covered his body from the pain and fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only then did Alin snap out of her shock. She quickly walked to Alexander's side and asked with concern, "Alexander, are you alright?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander shook his head with a smile. "Your son is sick and needs a kidney transplant?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alin bit her lip and sighed heavily, "Yes. My son's kidneys were damaged in a car accident, leading to kidney failure. We haven't been able to find a suitable donor, and without enough money, we've had to keep putting it off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The doctors gave us their final notice. They said if he doesn't get the transplant within a week, his life could be in danger."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alin's face was deathly pale as she spoke, her brows tightly knitted with worry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander let out a sigh and said, "You should have come to me sooner. I can help you. We should be able to resolve this really fast."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Really?" Hope flickered in Alin's eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander then called </span><span>Melin</span><span> and explained the situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, several police cars and ambulances arrived at the scene.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melin</span><span> personally led the team, loading Carl and the other survivors into the vehicles before focusing on confirming Raymond's identity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This guy is a wanted international human and organ trafficker. I can't believe you caught him! Are you hurt?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melin</span><span> was practically buzzing with excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm fine. These bastards couldn't hurt me." Alexander waved his hand dismissively with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Given the severity of the case, </span><span>Melin</span><span> gave Alexander's arm a gentle squeeze before leading her team to begin their search and investigation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alin stood there in a daze, feeling like she was stuck in some surreal dream.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come on," Alexander said with a gentle smile. "Let's go check on your son."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh no, that's too much trouble. I couldn't possibly..." Alin's heart swelled with emotion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though she and Alexander weren't particularly close, something about his presence felt familiar, almost like family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Following Alin's lead, Alexander headed to the hospital with her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She suddenly stopped in front of the payment counter, her expression turning awkward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander gave a gentle smile, knowing exactly what was going through Alin's mind. "I'll have someone transfer three million dollars to you. That should cover everything," he said with a warm expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh my god. Three million is way too much. I couldn't possibly use all that!" Alin's tears started flowing, glistening as they rolled down her cheeks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander gave her shoulder a reassuring squeeze. "Hey, we're old classmates. Just take it and focus on taking care of your son at the hospital. If you run into any other problems, call me right away. I'll help sort things out."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you so much." Alin kept expressing her gratitude through tears. She knew there were no words to properly convey her feelings, so she just let the tears flow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After leaving the hospital, Alexander let out a heavy sigh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The wealth gap in this world is just insane. Some people are living in luxury while others are dying on the streets."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His mood grew somber as memories flooded back</span><span>&mdash;</span><span>his time at the Fairfax Villa, all those moments of being looked down on and humiliated. Lost in these dark thoughts, he fell into a long silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's on your mind? Did you sort everything out with your classmate?" Ava pulled up in her car just then.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, it's handled. I just hope she finds happiness," Alexander replied with a forced smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava ruffled his hair gently. "You've already done more than enough. You're not some superhero who can save everyone, so don't be so hard on yourself."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava planted a soft kiss on his cheek, gazing at him with tender affection. The gesture instantly captured Alexander's full attention.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As CEO, Ava had this incredible ice queen vibe going on, but there was also something irresistibly alluring about her. She was like fire and ice rolled into one</span><span>&mdash;</span><span>a combo that was absolutely lethal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With those perfect curves and that gorgeous face, she was seriously out of this world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop staring at me like that. What's wrong? It's kind of creepy," Ava teased, pretending to be bothered but secretly loving the attention. "Come on, it's not like you haven't seen all of me before."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's go grab some food. That'll cheer you up," Ava suggested. She drove them to the </span><span>super trendy restaurant she'd heard about, where they had an amazing meal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The place happened to be right next to the city's busiest bar strip. Feeling the night was still young, they picked the most happening spot and headed inside.</span></p><div class="pagination">
