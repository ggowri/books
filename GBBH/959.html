  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Asher smiled, a hint of satisfaction in his voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's really a small thing. My grandfather's officially taking over the West Cemetery the day after tomorrow. Today, one of my men went to move a tombstone, but not only did someone stop him, they even beat him up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You've got to help me find this person and make them pay!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Oliver's face instantly relaxed into a reassuring smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I thought it was something serious! Don't worry, Mr. Vance. I've got this covered. The day after tomorrow, I'll have people out there to keep the peace. If anyone causes trouble, they're getting arrested, no exceptions."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Asher gave a satisfied nod.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Good. I'll be sure to speak highly of you in front of my grandfather."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ryder, who had been quietly listening, couldn't hide a smug grin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "Lennox, you're finished. The day after tomorrow, you won't even have a job anymore. And that guy who laid a hand on me... he's as good as dead."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Lily and Alexander were preparing to make a few calls to their relatives, inviting them to the memorial ceremony the day after tomorrow, to help guard Alexander's mother's grave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aunt Lily, when my mom passed away, it seemed like Uncle Elliot and Cameron didn't even show up for the funeral. But I still want to call them and see if they'll come to the memorial," Alexander said, dialing his phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily sighed deeply. "Ever since your dad went missing, your uncles have cut ties with us. They're living comfortably now and probably won't come.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't think we need to bother calling them. Just have your aunt Maya's family come instead."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander gave a slight smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I know. Both Uncle Elliot and Cameron are selfish and greedy, always afraid I'll ask them for money.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If they knew I had money now, they'd probably come crawling to take advantage of me. But they don't, and to them, I'm still just a useless good-for-nothing."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's face grew serious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But, at the end of the day, they're still my family. If they come to my mom's memorial, I'll help them get into high society.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If they don't come, then they can't blame me for cutting ties with them in the future."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily let out another long sigh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright then, call them. I just hope they're not so heartless, and I really don't want your mom's memorial to be too lonely."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander gave her a mysterious smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry, Aunt Lily. My mom's memorial will definitely not be lonely. It'll be grand."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily gave a wry smile, clearly skeptical. She didn't know much about Alexander's achievements, only that he'd made some money recently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander picked up his phone and dialed Elliot's number.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hello, Uncle Elliot, it's Alexander. Sorry to bother you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a long silence on the other end, a cold voice finally answered, sounding clearly annoyed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's you, Alexander? Why are you calling me? I'm busy, don't have time for small talk. What do you want?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The voice was impatient.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was polite as ever, saying, "Uncle Elliot, the day after tomorrow is my mom's memorial, and I want to invite you to come. Will you be able to make it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The other end was silent again, and Alexander thought the signal might be bad.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, Elliot spoke.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, it's not that I don't want to come, but I'm really swamped right now. I just don't have the time. Don't bother me with stuff like this again."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander showed a cold smile. The response was just as he had expected.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He pushed aside the disappointment and anger building up inside and replied in a calm tone, "Uncle Elliot, since you won't come, don't come to me for help in the future. I won't be there for you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?! Alexander, what the hell did you just say? You're a worthless loser, living off women, and now you're trying to act tough with me?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If I were there, I'd slap you across the face to wake you up!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"From now on, I don't know you. Don't come looking for me. We're done."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, the line went dead as Elliot angrily hung up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The room fell silent. Alexander had put the call on speaker, so Lily had heard everything clearly. She let out another sigh, clearly resigned.</span></p><div class="pagination">
