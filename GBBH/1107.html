  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Exactly, we're family," Gale said, his eyes filled with joy. He wasn't just happy&mdash;he was genuinely proud of his future son-in-law's abilities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jaden's face darkened as he shot his son a furious glare.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Howard looked like a bird caught by the neck, his face stiff, unable to say a word.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jaden kicked Howard hard, his voice low but filled with anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You fool, don't you owe Mr. Hawthorne an apology?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I... Dad..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Howard trembled under his father's fierce gaze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Are you deaf? Apologize!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jaden's roar was full of frustration. He felt like his dignity had been crushed right in front of everyone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I... I'm sorry, Mr. Hawthorne..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Howard mumbled, head down, deflated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But the pain in his broken leg was nothing compared to the humiliation. Not only had he been insulted, but now he had to swallow his pride alone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander glanced at him coldly, a faint sneer tugging at his lips. That look made Howard boil with anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jaden quickly stepped in front of Alexander, completely dropping his pride. He bowed deeply.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne, I'm truly sorry. I didn't see things clearly earlier, and I failed as a father. Please accept my apology."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The room fell silent. The Lawson family looked on, their expressions conflicted. No one had expected Jaden to publicly apologize like this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But there was nothing they could do. Alexander had not only saved Gavin's life but was also set to be a member of the Lawson family, a man whose status far surpassed Jaden's or Howard's.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At that moment, the entire Lawson family smiled, eager to win favor with Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander hadn't expected Jaden to be able to swallow his pride like that. After all, his son had just had his leg broken by Alexander, and yet he still managed to apologize.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When Alexander didn't respond immediately, Jaden's respect only grew.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Finally, Alexander nodded. "I accept your apology. But I hope this doesn't happen again."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jaden smiled, then shot Howard a deadly glare.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Get out of here! Are you trying to make this worse?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Howard flinched, dragging his broken leg out of the room, half-walking, half-crawling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Just then, Grace asked, "Alexander, is Grandpa okay? Why hasn't he woken up yet?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone turned to Gavin. His heartbeat had returned, and there were subtle movements in his body, but he still hadn't fully regained consciousness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The room fell silent except for the sound of everyone's breathing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander furrowed his brow, his eyes fixed on Gavin as if lost in thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Minutes passed&mdash;one, then two, then three...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Five minutes passed in complete silence. Alexander didn't speak a word, just staring intently at Gavin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gale exchanged worried glances with his daughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Grace cautiously asked, "Alexander, what's going on with Grandpa?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander shook his head. "Gavin's stroke wasn't natural. He's been poisoned. Someone's behind this."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What?! Poisoned?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone gasped in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander nodded firmly. "Yes, poisoned. And this poison... it feels strangely familiar. I think it's connected to the Immortality Serum developed by the Sakra Society."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gale's face turned pale, and he immediately waved his hand. "Everyone, out!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With the exception of Gale, Grace, Jaden, and Alexander, everyone else was quickly ushered out of the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gale anxiously asked,</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Alexander, you think my father's poisoning is linked to the Apocalypse Project from the Sakra Society? But the Apocalypse Project was stopped, and all the elixirs were destroyed!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before Alexander could answer, Gale's phone rang.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He glanced at his phone instinctively, and his face immediately turned pale.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Everyone, quick, check the news. Many world leaders and important figures are in trouble&mdash; their symptoms are the same as Sir Lawson's: brain strokes!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander and the others quickly checked the headlines, and it was true.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Yinson, that old bastard, is at it again. He's bringing back the Apocalypse Project!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This time, he's targeting world leaders to create chaos and take advantage of the situation."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander's words made Gale and the others go pale.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Grace grabbed Alexander's arm, urgency in her voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Alexander, I don't care about Yinson or the Apocalypse Project right now. Can you just help my grandfather recover?"</span></p><div class="pagination">
