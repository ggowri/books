  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hudson roared, "I've already notified the Vance Group. You must provide an additional 10 billion dollars in collateral within one hour, or we'll immediately reclaim the loan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you fail to provide the 10 billion dollars, our bank will have no choice but to move forward with sealing up the Vance Group and initiating bankruptcy proceedings."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Asher could even respond, Hudson hung up. The line went dead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The scene was deathly quiet. The conversation had been so loud that everyone within earshot had heard it clearly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Asher and Axel stood frozen, dumbfounded. They thought, "Why would dozens of international financial giants join forces to short Vance Group?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Could it be Alexander?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No, that's impossible. He's just a gang leader. There was no way he had that kind of power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It couldn't be Gavin, either. He wouldn't dare go to war with the Vance family like this."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they struggled to make sense of the chaos, Gavin and the other big shots were </span><span>equally shocked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They knew it was Alexander behind this. Any one of them could've done something like this, but how did Alexander pull it off?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ding!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, it was Axel's phone that rang. Both he and Asher exchanged uneasy glances, a sense of dread washing over them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hello, Mr. Mansfield. What is it? Your company wants to terminate all cooperation?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Axel's face turned grim as he hung up the phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Immediately after, Asher's phone rang again. He roared, veins bulging in his neck, "What? Say that again? Our company was smashed? Who smashed it? The wires were cut? The water pipes broken? Are you all useless? You can't even figure out who did it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each piece of grim news hit like a bullet, leaving Asher and Axel reeling with anxiety and a crushing sense of helplessness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Vance family was not only facing a demand for 10 billion dollars in collateral within an hour, but their largest business partner had just terminated all cooperation. To top it off, the power and water supply at the Vance Group headquarters had been sabotaged, which was enough to drive them up the wall!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leopold Dunn wore a face of sorrow, looking as though he'd just lost his parents.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a voice laced with desperation, Asher cried out, "Grandpa, what are we going to do? Where on earth can we scrape together 10 billion dollars for collateral in just one hour?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Axel felt a chill crawl up his spine like he'd been plunged into an icy abyss.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smirked, declaring, "I told </span><span>you,</span><span> your family is going bankrupt. Even if you've got a lieutenant general in your pocket, there's nothing he can do to help you now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone's gaze was fixed on Alexander, eyes wide with a mix of shock and bewilderment, all trying to fathom how he pulled it off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander remained unfazed. He'd already coordinated with Nancy, the leader of the Kaylon, and Norma, president of Sakra Society, the day before. They had agreed to join forces and target the Vance Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For centuries, the Kaylon and the Sakra Society had woven their vast tapestries through the cosmos, with influence and assets hidden in the shadows that far exceeded the Ultimate Alliance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Together, their combined wealth was in the trillions. Crushing the Vance Group, which held a mere 10 billion dollars in assets, was child's play for them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was as effortless as stepping on an ant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Axel's body moved stiffly as he shuffled toward Alexander, his voice trembling when he spoke, "Did you do this? How did you manage it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All eyes were on Alexander, waiting for an answer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Vance family, one of the most powerful families in the </span><span>Kingsdon</span><span>, was on the brink of bankruptcy, and it was happening right before everyone's eyes. It was almost unthinkable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one could wrap their heads around it, not the Vance family, not Gavin and his </span><span>cronies, and not even Alexander's own relatives. They were all stunned, trying to comprehend how Alexander had pulled off something of this magnitude.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Ava, who had mentally prepared herself for Alexander's capabilities, felt a surge of excitement and awe. She hadn't expected Alexander to be this powerful to have the ability to bring a multi-billion-dollar family to its knees.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's smile was cold, dripping with contempt, "I told </span><span>you,</span><span> West Cemetery no longer belongs to your Vance family. If you want any chance to fix this, you'll kneel in front of the tombstone and apologize to my mother."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Axel's face twisted in humiliation, but he couldn't find the words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Asher, on the other hand, clenched his fists, yelling, "Grandpa, we can't kneel! I'll kill him before I let that happen!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shut up!" Axel bellowed, his body trembling with the force of his own shout.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a sound like thunder, he fell to his knees right out in the open, his posture shifting from standing to kneeling, as straight as an arrow, in front of the tombstone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every heartbeat skipped, a collective shudder passing through the crowd. Here was the patriarch of the Vance family from </span><span>Kingsdon</span><span>, the very embodiment of the Vance family's grandeur and might.</span></p><div class="pagination">
