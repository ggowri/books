Although she didn't know who Barry was, she didn't dare to neglect it after hearing Alexander's name.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this time, Barry and Felix were on their way to the casino.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix smiled, "I didn't expect that you are like me and like to gamble for fun."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barry nodded. "Let's take a little gamble. I've been to all the famous casinos in the world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is the money ready?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He asked Felix.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry, Mr. Morris. Of course."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barry asked, "How much have you prepared?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barry's tone was calm, but it gave Felix an ominous premonition.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Five million dollars should be enough, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix answered carefully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joyce immediately started yelling with surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What? Only five million dollars? Felix, do you think Mr. Morris is a beggar?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix was helpless and </span><span>said</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Morris, you just play. I'll pay. How's that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, Felix felt distressed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barry was not just a gambler for fun but gambler addict.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Casinos were full of scams. Barry would definitely lose a lot of money. Felix wanted to kill him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A rare smile finally appeared on Barry's gloomy face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said, "Very good. With a tycoon paying for me, I feel confident."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix said nothing, but his expression was cold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He further downgraded his evaluation of Barry. Although Barry was capable, he was arrogant and addicted to gambling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's not difficult to deal with such a person." Thinking, Felix felt a lot more relieved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "If I get a chance to kill Barry, refine it into a potion, I'll get a boost."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A military airport in the far suburbs of </span><span>Kingsdon</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander walked down the plane's gangway step by step, holding his sleeping daughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was filled with murderous feelings for Felix.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander used the secret technique inherited from the Ultimate Legacy and used the Force to temporarily change his appearance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His facial contour and facial features were similar to before, but had a mysterious temperament, as if he had become a different person.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Rosalia, who was familiar with him, couldn't recognize him at first.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ashley, I will heal you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander whispered softly in Ashley's ear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ashley heard his voice and finally opened her eyes and smiled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She said, "Dad, I'm fine..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander couldn't help but kiss her on the cheek. With treatment, Ashley temporarily regained consciousness, but only for a month at most.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The genetic serum would constantly harm Ashley's body. Alexander couldn't wait to find Felix as soon as possible to help Ashley recover her health.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander would do anything for that!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He asked, "Alice's intelligence hasn't been sent yet? Why haven't we confirmed the exact location of Felix?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's eyes were filled with murderous intent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this time, a pleasant and delicate female voice was heard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A beautiful woman with a good figure, riding a handsome black motorcycle, followed by a dozen similar black motorcycles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brittany slammed on the brakes and stopped steadily in front of Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She changed into a sexy black leather jacket and leather pants, which made her look even hotter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brittany got out of the car gracefully and stood in front of Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her exposed thigh-high legs immediately attracted the attention of all the men.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Taking off the black helmet, her beautiful face appeared, with a charming smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In particular, her breasts made her more attractive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brittany said, "Alexander, for the sake of confidentiality, I did not arrange any vehicles. These motorcycles are all military!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brittany patted the back seat of the motorcycle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smiled, "Thanks to your help, I could land at this military airfield."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He sat on it without hesitation, holding Ashley.</span></p><div class="pagination">
