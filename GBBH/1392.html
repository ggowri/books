  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The woman hesitated. Although the sect had always valued items with unique materials and extraordinary weight, she mainly came to the auction for another thing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She looked at the second floor and frowned, "1.8 million silver coins."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Two million silver coins." Alexander's voice was calm. He was determined to get the ring. Instead of haggling over the price, it was better to raise it high to show his determination.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The old man in black on the stage saw that the woman in the red dress remained silent for a long time. Knowing that she had given up, he shouted, "The VIP customer on the second floor offers two million coins. Is there any higher bid? Going once! Going twice! Gone!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as the old man finished speaking, he held the ring with both hands and put it into a large iron box, which was then carried down by six burly men.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The bidding for this suspected divine's relic was so intense that it aroused the passion of many people.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The atmosphere in the hall became extremely heated all of a sudden. Many divine weapons, rare pills, and cultivation techniques were snapped up by the enthusiastic audience.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander had already gotten the ring. The moment he touched the ring, the mysterious golden energy in his chest quivered wildly as if it was overjoyed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Basically, it could be confirmed that the ring was definitely a treasure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The ring was indeed heavy. It was black as if it was made of black iron, but it wasn't. There were tiny golden characters inlaid on it, but they couldn't be seen easily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander thought, "I'm at the peak of a level-four warrior, and there is still a long way to go before reaching the Divine Transformation State. The ring is something favored by the mysterious golden energy, so it should be a treasure. The ring is black, so I can call it Black Iron Ring.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The jewelry and other items were sold for a total of 5.86 million silver coins. The ring cost two million silver coins, and I still have 3.86 million silver coins. Let me buy something else. I don't want to die on the battlefield one day. Improving my strength is the most important thing now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a while, the old man in black on the stage held a small white ring and said loudly, "This is the Immortal Trapping Ring. A painstaking work by Kearney Bosh, a treasure-refining master in the Divine Transformation State. It can be used by a level-four warrior. This ring has great power and can be used three times. It can trap and kill enemies below the Divine Transformation State!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The audience sighed, "It's a pity that it can only be used three times."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is for killing opponents across levels!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bullshit! Do you think it's that easy to trap a level-five warrior in it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's right! A level-five warrior has returned to simplicity. Its strength is immeasurable. You'll be defeated as soon as you meet a level-five warrior. What's the use of the ring then?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander stroked his chin and muttered, "This ring is useful. Even a level-five warrior can't kill me easily."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The old man on the stage said, "The starting price of this ring is 200 thousand silver coins. The auction starts now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those people who were interested in this ring started bidding, "300 thousand silver coins!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Four hundred thousand silver coins!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Two hours later, in the Dominion Church's Outer Court, Alexander sat on a large chair, carefully looking at these items he had auctioned today.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Black Iron Ring, with a unique material, neither gold nor gem, weighing thousands of pounds, with unknown effects. The auction price was two million coins. After a 10% discount for VIP customers, it was 1.8 million silver coins.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Immortal Trapping Ring could be used by a level-four warrior. It could be used three times and could trap and kill enemies below the Divine Transformation State. The auction price was 3.8 million silver coins. After a 10% discount, it was 3.42 million silver coins.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>According to the explanation in "Book of Spirit Beast", a bottle of Centenary Spirit Beast Liquid could enhance the strength of spirit beasts. It cost 600 thousand coins.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander gave the scholar and Sonya a reward of 20 thousand silver coins. Alexander had sold out half a box of jewels and spent 586.3 thousand gold coins. There were only 23 thousand silver coins left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander thought, "Money burns a hole in my pocket. It's not easy to meet someone as rich and stupid as Klein again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It's good to have a lot of money. Even Sonya winked at me when I left. What a pity! I'm a married man now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking of Isolde, Alexander couldn't help but be in a daze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander poured the Centenary Spirit Beast Liquid into the Spirit Beast Bag to nourish the Tigris. He stroked his chin and thought, "I have to reach the peak of level-four warrior in the remaining twenty-odd days.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In this way, with the golden energy and the Energy Plot Attack, I can have the ability to fight against an ordinary level-five warrior.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for Klein's Levitating Technique... When I was on earth, I remembered that in "Dragon Ball", the Energy Plot Attack could be emitted from the feet. It could greatly increase the user's burst speed."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the drill ground of the southern camp of the Darwin Garrison, there were 500 thousand soldiers, including 200 thousand cavalry, 200 thousand elite infantry, and 100 thousand soldiers for transporting. Each one of them was high-spirited.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the drill ground, the flags were fluttering. The clatter of swords and spears could be heard everywhere. Waves of murderous aura filled the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The commanding platform was several feet high. It was built with large stone strips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the platform, a red flag was fluttering in the wind. On one side of the flag, there were two dragons playing with a ball embroidered with gold thread. At the ball, there was a big character "Schneier". On the other side, there was a golden character "Hrodvik".</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were dozens of people standing under the flag. All of them were armored generals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The person in the front was Fermin Schneier, the Minister of the Ministry of Defense. He wore a silver helmet and a silver armor. He had a square face, thick eyebrows, big eyes, and a long beard. He held a purple-gold sword in his hand, looking very majestic.</span></p><div class="pagination">
