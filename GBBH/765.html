  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, I just love a woman with a fiery temper. Makes it all the more fun."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Woodrow sneered, wiping the spit off his face, then sticking his fingers in his mouth to lick it, grinning lecherously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get away, you sick freak!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alyssa's disgust was clear; she felt ready to vomit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kerwin smirked, adding, "Woodrow, stop wasting time. If you're not going for it, I will."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Animals! If either of you lays a hand on me, I'll kill you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alyssa thrashed against her restraints in vain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Woodrow chuckled, "Oh yeah? Then go on, kill me&mdash;with that big ass of yours!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Look at her acting all innocent," he sneered. "Women are meant to please men, especially ones like you who are just begging for it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come on, scream for me! The louder, the better!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Woodrow took a small vial of red pill, forced Alyssa's mouth open, and tried to stuff it in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Go to hell!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alyssa shot her leg out and landed a swift kick straight to Woodrow's groin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As a normal wizard, Woodrow wasn't quick enough to dodge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He never expected that Alyssa, already bound to the pillar, could suddenly launch an attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alyssa, even restrained, had used all her strength, and her blow struck true.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Woodrow let out a wail, clutching himself and collapsing on the ground as the vial clattered down, spilling red pills across the floor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah... hurts like hell!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Woodrow gasped, breaking out in a sweat as pain wracked his body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It took Kerwin a moment to snap out of his shock, but when he did, his face twisted with rage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You dare to pull a stunt like that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grabbing Alyssa by her collar, he slapped her hard across the face, splitting her lip and making her vision blur.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You kick me, huh? I'll make you pay!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Woodrow, still grimacing in pain, picked himself up and shakily brandished a black rod. His face twisted as he pointed it at Alyssa, trembling with fury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Kerwin could stop him, Woodrow unleashed a spell.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sizzle!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A bolt of black energy shot toward Alyssa like an arrow, but a bright flash intercepted it, forming a protective barrier that absorbed the spell.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alyssa glanced down and realized the source of the light: a gleaming amulet around her neck. It was the amulet Alexander had given her, crafted from high-grade gems and engraved with a powerful magic circle to guard against witchcraft.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What the fuck?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Woodrow stared, eyes wide with shock. He raised the rod again, firing two more bolts toward her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bang!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both spells vanished the moment they touched the shield of light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They fell silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alyssa herself was stunned, looking down at the amulet. It was Alexander's gift, and now it was protecting her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kerwin's shock turned to a greedy grin as he realized what she had.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"An amulet that blocks magic! Who gave you this? Tell me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Woodrow's eyes glittered with desire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A protective amulet of this kind was a treasure that any sorcerer would covet, an item so rare that only the most skilled dark wizards in the City of Sorcery could create even one.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It would be impossible for ordinary sorcerers like Woodrow and Kerwin to possess something like that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Owning such an item would elevate any sorcerer's status, giving them access to rare resources and advanced </span><span>spell-books</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For Alyssa, an ordinary person, to possess something so precious was a complete waste.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Woodrow reached for the amulet, gripping its chain tightly. "Where did this come from? Are there more of them? Tell me now, and maybe I'll spare you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kerwin seized Woodrow's arm, eyes blazing with intensity. "We both found it, remember? This belongs to both of us!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Woodrow shot him a cold glare.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Patience. Let me get some answers first. She might have more than one."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kerwin, equally eager, barked at Alyssa, "Come on, Alyssa! If you have another amulet, hand it over, and we might let you go."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two of them started shoving each other, each wanting the amulet for himself.</span></p><div class="pagination">
