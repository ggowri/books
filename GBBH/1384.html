  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He originally had&nbsp;40,000 coins, then&nbsp;Josh&nbsp;contributed another&nbsp;90,000.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The&nbsp;Sacred Spirit Gang&nbsp;had&nbsp;370,000 coins&nbsp;in silver and gold combined, bringing his total to&nbsp;500,000 coins&mdash;not counting the half-chest of jewels.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And now,&nbsp;300,000 coins&nbsp;were gone in an instant&mdash;money burned like water.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After spending on the&nbsp;Dimensional pouch, he had&nbsp;1,000 martial virtue pointsleft. Over the past&nbsp;seven months, he accumulated&nbsp;8,000 points, spent&nbsp;5,000, and now had&nbsp;3,000&nbsp;remaining.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at the shelves full of rare treasures, he still felt it wasn't enough!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he wanted to break through the limits of martial arts quickly, money was essential. Fortunately, he was blessed with great fortune&mdash;hahaha!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander left the hall, handing the&nbsp;millennium ginseng&nbsp;and other medicinal ingredients to&nbsp;Liora. He paid a&nbsp;1,000-coin&nbsp;fee for the preparation and bid her farewell. Under her curious gaze, he headed for the main gate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jaryl&nbsp;saw the two young men&mdash;one tall, one short&mdash;walking out of the gate and immediately led his men over to intercept them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jaryl&nbsp;had already learned that the two were once mere temple laborers, but the tall one,&nbsp;Alexander, was now an&nbsp;Outer Court&nbsp;disciple. Even so, he remained cautious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Keeping his expression unreadable, he asked in a low voice, "You two... do you have ties with&nbsp;Father Elias?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander shot him a sidelong glance. "Who do you think you are?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How dare you!" A few of&nbsp;Jaryl's&nbsp;followers immediately lunged forward, ready to teach them a lesson.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stand down!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jaryl&nbsp;barked the order, his pale face turning a deep shade of red with anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I'm an&nbsp;Inner Court&nbsp;disciple&mdash;one of the elite, born to rule. And this so-called&nbsp;level-four warrior, this insect, dares to insult me?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But this was the&nbsp;Dominion Church's&nbsp;grounds, right at the entrance of the&nbsp;Hall of Lives. He still wasn't sure what connection these two had to Elias.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jaryl's&nbsp;face darkened as he slowly said, "Gentlemen, I'm willing to offer&nbsp;1,000,000 silver coins&nbsp;and&nbsp;100,000 martial virtue points&nbsp;in exchange for a single drop of&nbsp;Divine Liquid! From now on, if you ever need anything, you can come find me in the&nbsp;Inner Court."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd erupted in shock. "Divine Liquid?! That's a&nbsp;Hall of Livessacred relic!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even&nbsp;level-five warriors&nbsp;can't get their hands on that!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A&nbsp;million coins&nbsp;and&nbsp;100,000 points?! That's insane..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's brows shot up, and he burst into laughter. "You're insane!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Logan&nbsp;just nodded, muttering, "Crazy... this guy's completely lost it..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, the two of them turned and walked away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jaryl&nbsp;exploded with rage. "You're asking for death!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His hand clenched around his folding fan, the wood creaking under pressure. He glared at their retreating backs, but in the end, he didn't make a move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the way back, Alexander reminded&nbsp;Logan&nbsp;to be extra cautious and focus on his training, aiming to master a&nbsp;level-one internal energy techniqueas soon as possible.&nbsp;Logan&nbsp;nodded and promised he would.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Returning to his&nbsp;Outer Court&nbsp;residence, Alexander felt completely satisfied. He had already repaid&nbsp;Jaryl&nbsp;for his past arrogance&mdash;and probably pissed him off even more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've already made so many enemies&mdash;what's one more?&nbsp;Julius, Madden, Rhodes, Sacred Spirit Order... now&nbsp;Jaryl&nbsp;is just another name on the list."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He took out a&nbsp;white jade bottle, filled it with clear water, and carefully dripped in a single drop of&nbsp;Divine Liquid&nbsp;from a&nbsp;green jade vial. Instantly, a rich, fragrant aroma spread through the air, filling him with a deep sense of tranquility.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He immediately ordered his servant,&nbsp;Clyde, to bring a large tub of hot water. Following the instructions for the&nbsp;Marrow Cleansing Pill&nbsp;and&nbsp;Blood Essence Powder, he divided them into ten portions, dissolved one portion into the water, and added a single diluted drop of&nbsp;Divine Liquid. The entire room filled with a musky orchid-like fragrance, and the bathwater turned into a clear, vibrant green.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stripping down, Alexander sank into the large wooden tub, channeling his energy as he entered a deep state of meditation. A powerful, burning&nbsp;golden energy&nbsp;surged from his chest, drawing in&nbsp;spiritual energy&nbsp;from the heavens and earth at an incredible rate, flooding his entire body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A grimace of pain crossed his face as blood seeped from the corner of his mouth. It felt as if he had been plunged into a vat of acid&mdash;his muscles burned away, his meridians spasmed violently, his bones cracked and splintered, and tiny droplets of blood seeped from every pore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The&nbsp;rampaging medicinal energy&nbsp;tore through his muscles, meridians, and bones&mdash;breaking them down over and over. But his&nbsp;mystic golden energy, along with an unfamiliar&nbsp;cooling force, steadily repaired his body in return...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before he knew it, an entire night had passed. Alexander opened his eyes, his pupils radiating with fierce&nbsp;divine light. Clenching his fists, he felt raw power surging through his entire body. He had an overwhelming urge to challenge&nbsp;Vegeta&nbsp;to a fight right then and there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That money was well spent.&nbsp;In just one night, he had gained the equivalent of&nbsp;two months of grueling training. At this rate, it wouldn't be long before he reached the&nbsp;peak of level-four warrior.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So this was the true power of the&nbsp;Marrow Cleansing Pill&nbsp;and&nbsp;Blood Essence Powder&mdash;their effects were incredibly potent. For an ordinary&nbsp;level-four warrior, using them even once was like suffering&nbsp;severe injuries to their bones and meridians.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The medicine forced&nbsp;the Force&nbsp;deeper into the meridians and bone marrow, accelerating the&nbsp;marrow cleansing and blood refinement process. Normally, a single dose was worth an entire month of rigorous training. However, each use inflicted&nbsp;serious damage, requiring at least half a month to recover. Otherwise, there was no way it would cost only&nbsp;100,000 coins&nbsp;and&nbsp;2,000 martial virtue points&nbsp;per bottle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Alexander had his&nbsp;divine golden energy&nbsp;and&nbsp;Divine Liquid, which allowed his body to heal rapidly. Not only did this&nbsp;double the effects, but he could also fully recover in just a few days. To him, the&nbsp;Marrow Cleansing Pill&nbsp;and&nbsp;Blood Essence Powder&nbsp;were an&nbsp;absolute bargain!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander muttered to himself, "The most important thing... is having money!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
