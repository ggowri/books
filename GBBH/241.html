  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Peter said dully, "Today is our group's turn to guard Mr. Butler. When we left, Mr. Butler was still in the office. </span><span>However</span><span>... I saw him preparing weapons and clothes. He should leave soon, but I don't know where he's going."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this time, Tom added, "I heard that Mr. Butler has a mistress outside. That woman is very favored. Mr. Butler goes to see her every Friday night. Today is Friday, so Mr. Butler will definitely date with that woman."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's eyes brightened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What John took the initiative to see shouldn't be a mistress but the hidden Guzman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How long have you not seen Guzman?" Alexander continued to ask.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Peter replied truthfully, "It's been a long time... I remember the last time I saw Mr. Bryant was half a month ago... We used to see him often at the trading center."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander further confirmed that Guzman was not hiding underground in the trading center.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay, pick up your weapons. Now continue to find the stripper. Keep going... You will forget everything in a while. This is just an illusion..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander commanded them with a bewitching voice while swinging the pocket watch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Peter and his companions walked towards the red-light district in a daze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gradually, they disappeared into the night.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a while, Peter suddenly rushed over, looking around in horror.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The rest of the group also came over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Peter, why did you run back?" Tom asked curiously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Peter rubbed his temples hard and asked in confusion, "Don't you guys feel like we forgot something? We just met someone here... Something happened, but I can't remember anything!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked around in horror, but there was no one around, with no clues.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The others laughed and said, "Peter, did you daydream? Aren't we going to find the new stripper? What could happen?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Peter slapped his forehead and laughed awkwardly. "Maybe I drank too much and took some magic medicine before. It should be an illusion."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He took a few more glances at the dark alley and left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When the figures of the group disappeared, Alexander appeared from the shadows with a sinister smile on his lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His Force Control was getting stronger, and it could erase someone's memory of a certain period.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even someone with Peter's strength couldn't restore the truth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>According to Peter and Tom, John was very likely to leave the trading center tonight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander continued to lurk, waiting patiently for John to appear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While observing the trading center, he let his thoughts wander, entering a trance-like state, perfectly blending into the darkness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Occasionally, stray cats and dogs passed by. With their keen senses, they didn't notice a human hidden in the shadows.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Guzman has done many evil deeds and has tried to kill me many times. He must die! I must take over Treasure Island. This is an international hub for black market transactions and is extremely important. If I can seize a batch of potential potions from the Red Umbrella Group, it would be best to help Augusta and others improve their strength..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander pondered the next plan while waiting patiently for John to appear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was like a tiger lurking in the dark. As soon as the prey appeared, it would be killed in one blow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After more than an hour, it was already early morning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The lights on the island became fewer. Only the red-light district was bright, dressing up the nightlife of Treasure Island.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, Alexander was not tired or irritable because of the wait, but his energy was adjusted to the peak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His deep eyes were bright, staring at the trading center without blinking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, three black cars drove out of the underground parking lot of the trading center in a row.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They drove in three different directions, which made Alexander a bit caught off guard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fortunately, he had the Force and immediately sensed that there was no breath of John in any of the three cars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander sneered, "John is really cunning. Unfortunately, no matter how cunning the fox is, it can't escape the hunter's grasp!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
