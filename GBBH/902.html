  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eamonn stammered, "Ms. Hawkins, I have signed an alliance with Mr. Welsh. You have to help me become the family head and gang leader. How can you go back on your word?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vivian snorted contemptuously and said coldly, "Locke is already dead. Are you going to hell and reason with him?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eamonn was stunned for a moment, and the people standing on his side all had bitter faces and deep regret.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Norma didn't know why Vivian came to support her, but she knew Alexander must have arranged it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Eamonn, do you still want to compete with me for the position of family head?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Norma's tone was full of murderous intent, and it was apparent that she was preparing to deal with him to frighten the others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eamonn knew that if he continued to confront Norma, he would surely die miserably.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He gritted his teeth, bent down deeply, and whispered, "I'm sorry... Please... Please forgive me, Ms. Walsh..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The dozens of Walsh family executives behind him also bowed and apologized, and some even knelt to beg for mercy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These people were all dejected, and their expressions were as gloomy as if their family had died.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander pointed at Eamonn and said, "Everyone else can be forgiven, but not this guy."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What bad news!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eamonn's face turned pale, and he immediately shouted, "This is our family issue. The family lead has the final say. Who are you to speak?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He has every right!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Norma answered it immediately, then waved her hand coldly. "Drag him away. Tie him up and feed him to the sharks."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eamonn was so frightened that he staggered back a few steps. He felt as if all the bones in his body were being pulled out, and he had no strength left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Norma glared at him. "What are you all standing there for? Do it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone came to their senses immediately, and someone rushed forward, twisted Eamonn's arms behind his back, and pushed him out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No matter how Eamonn begged for mercy or how much he cried, Norma had no intention of showing any mercy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was right. Now that her foundation was unstable, this was not the time to be soft-hearted. They must make an example of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, Vivian came over and took the initiative to extend her hand to Norma. "Ms. Walsh, wish it a happy cooperation!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander saw Norma in a daze and couldn't help but call her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Norma..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, okay, okay. From now on, we will be friends."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Norma woke up in shock and quickly shook hands with Vivian warmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, Alexander took out a list and said coldly, "Beyond Eamonn, your family harbors traitors linked to both the Mafia and the Sakra Society.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thanks to Ms. Hawkins who provided the list. Now I will read out the names one by one..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With his words, several guys looked highly panicked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They retreated quietly, trying to take the opportunity to slip away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If their identities were revealed, they would be doomed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Want to run? Where to?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander sneered contemptuously and waved his hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The cigarette butt in his hand flew over with sparks and immediately pierced through an old man's thigh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The old man fell to the ground, covering his bloody thigh and rolling over, howling like a pig being slaughtered, with blood flowing all over the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander said indifferently, "Whoever dares to step out of this door before I finish reading the list will die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His cold, murderous intent shocked everyone. Several traitors trembled violently but did not dare to get closer to the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Casey Walsh, Joe Walsh..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every time Alexander called out a person's name, Norma ordered people to arrest them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The traitors were discouraged and had no choice but to surrender.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone was shocked beyond words. They didn't expect to see a good show of catching traitors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was scary to think about it. With so many traitors hiding within the family, any decision would be transparent to the Sakra Society, which was simply unimaginable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The senior figures of the Walsh family had changed their attitude towards Alexander. They were not just grateful but also had a hint of awe to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Drag all the traitors out and feed them to the sharks! Take away all their property and distribute it to other members of the family."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Norma acted decisively and efficiently, demonstrating the skills and momentum of a strong woman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you, Ms. Walsh! I am willing to serve you at my utmost!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The members of the Walsh family were thrilled with their decision, reaping substantial property gains and embracing Norma as their true leader.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Norma leaned close to Alexander's ear and whispered anxiously, "Master, my sister Hazel hasn't come back for a whole night. Something must have happened!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
