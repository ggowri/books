  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When Alexander woke up, James was already lying on the ground. His frail body had become even smaller.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Slowly, James disintegrated into tiny particles of dust, which were carried away by the breeze and disappeared into the air.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander hadn't yet grasped what had just happened.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Warrior? The Force?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He was in shock, feeling as though a blade was twisting inside his body. The pain was excruciating.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Holding his head, disoriented and overwhelmed, he stumbled out of the nursing home, eventually collapsing to the ground.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava quickly opened the car door and ordered the driver, "Get him in the car! Take him to the hospital!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Seeing Alexander's pale face and still body, Ava's frown deepened.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Emma couldn't help but comment, "Did he do something shady in there and get beaten up for it?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava sighed, a bitter smile tugging at the corner of her mouth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If the Godfather has chosen him to be my fianc&eacute;, there must be a reason. I trust he's not just some ordinary man.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Drive, to the hospital!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In his unconscious state, Alexander felt as though he had been transported into the vastness of space, surrounded by countless shimmering stars that seemed to orbit around him, forming some mysterious connection.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At the same time, the overwhelming force within him finally calmed, settling deep inside his body.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A crystal-clear, liquid-like energy began flowing through Alexander; this was the Force, though he was still unsure how to control it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When Alexander finally opened his eyes again, he found himself lying in a private hospital room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You're awake at last!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava let out a sigh of relief, studying Alexander with a mix of curiosity and complexity as if trying to uncover what qualities had earned him the Godfather's favor.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander blinked, thinking to himself, "This woman is stunning, with perfect features, a gorgeous figure, and an aura of cold elegance. She's far more beautiful than Jane."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Did you bring me to the hospital?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava didn't want to reveal her identity just yet, so she simply smiled and said, "I was just passing by. But I'm curious, what exactly happened at the nursing home?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander could feel the presence of the Force within him, which James had passed on.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It wasn't a dream, it was real!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His heart surged with excitement, and the future suddenly seemed full of promise.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Seeing that Alexander remained silent, Ava grew annoyed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If you don't want to talk about it, fine. But I did save you, and you haven't even thanked me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Snapping out of his thoughts, Alexander quickly stood and gave a slight nod.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Thank you, miss. I'm deeply grateful. I'll be sure to repay you when the time comes."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava couldn't help but laugh.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She thought, "This guy looks quite honest, a bit foolishly cute, and he's even talking about repaying."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I don't need your thanks. I'm..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Suddenly, she stopped mid-sentence, her hand clutching her chest as pain flashed across her face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Emma, who had been watching, immediately pulled out Ava's medication.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Ms. Blackburn, you really need to take your medicine!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava sighed softly and nodded in agreement.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander, feeling a sudden impulse, focused his perception of the Force on Ava. The invisible force immediately enveloped her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Instantly, he sensed her condition as if it were laid out before him, clear as day.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He was thrilled, realizing he had truly become the legendary Warrior, though still just a Novice Warrior.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As Ava was about to take her medicine, Alexander quickly stopped her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Ms. Blackburn, I think I can cure your angina completely. Would you be willing to let me try?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava froze, her bright eyes widening in surprise.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"How did you know I have angina? It's congenital, caused by narrowed arteries. There's no cure."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander smiled mysteriously, "Maybe I can help."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava hesitated for a moment, intrigued by his confidence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Emma rolled her eyes in disdain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Ridiculous! The most renowned specialists couldn't cure her, and you're not even a doctor. What makes you think you can?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava, still curious, asked, "What's your treatment plan?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander replied calmly, "I would place my hand over your heart. That should be enough to cure it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava's face instantly flushed, and she glanced down at her own ample chest. She thought, "Is this guy just trying to take advantage of me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Emma's anger flared.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Pervert! What do you mean, place your hand over her heart? You're just trying to grope Ms. Blackburn! I've never seen someone so shameless!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava's expression darkened as well.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Do you know what happened to the last man who tried to take advantage of me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander could feel the tension rising from the bodyguards nearby. He felt this young woman was not to be underestimated.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, he remained calm and unflinching.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If you trust me, let me try."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The room fell silent, the atmosphere growing increasingly tense. Everyone was waiting for Ava's reaction.</p><div class="pagination">
