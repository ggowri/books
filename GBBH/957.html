  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lennox's fists were clenched as he shoved Ryder back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>So</span><span> what if the Vance family's involved? This is </span><span>Loscity</span><span>, not </span><span>Kingsdon</span><span>! As long as I'm in charge here, no one's touching this grave. You want to dig it up? You'll be out of a job before you can blink!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He turned to the workers holding shovels, his voice rising.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get out of here, all of you. You really want to risk your livelihoods for this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The workers froze, realizing the gravity of the situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lennox might still be the manager, and he meant it seriously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The cemetery jobs paid well, and getting fired would be a devastating blow to both their income and their families.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ryder, however, just smirked, unfazed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're not going to last as manager for long, Lennox. A single call to Sir Vance, and forget about your job. He'll buy the whole cemetery if he wants. You think you can stop him?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In two days, I'll have that grave dug up, and that manager's chair will be mine. Let's see who ends up getting kicked out."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he turned on his heel, his men reluctantly following behind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's gaze followed them, cold as ice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lennox had saved Ryder today. If he'd been a few seconds too late, Ryder wouldn't have walked away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lennox sighed, rubbing his temples, clearly conflicted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You all saw what just happened. If I were you, I'd think about moving the remains. The Vance family is serious. Once they set their sights on something, it's over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If they do buy this cemetery, there's not much I can do for you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily's face tightened with worry. She nodded quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're right, Mr. Wilder. Thank you for everything. We'll move the grave as soon as possible."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Alexander wasn't having it. "This is my mother's grave. She's already laid to rest. No one, not even the Vance family, will move her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lennox, looking even more exasperated, shook his head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You don't get it, do you? The Vance family is one of the most powerful in </span><span>Kingsdon</span><span>. You're going up against people who can crush you without even trying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Please, take my advice. Move the grave while you still can. If they buy this place, you won't even have that option anymore."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lennox sighed, turning to walk away, but Alexander's voice stopped him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry, Mr. Wilder. You'll still be in charge here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lennox didn't even look back, but the way he shook his head said it all. He wasn't convinced.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava, who had been quiet until now, whispered, "Mr. Wilder really is trying to help. He's a good person."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily's anxiety had reached a boiling point. She grabbed Alexander's hand, pleading.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, maybe we should move the grave, just to be safe. If they start digging it up, it'll be too late."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's eyes burned with cold fury. "Anyone who touches my mother's grave won't live to see another day."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily, teary-eyed, looked up at him desperately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, you can't kill anyone. If you do, you'll end up in prison. The Vance family has been a major force in </span><span>Loscity</span><span> for years. Now, they've moved to </span><span>Kingsdon</span><span> and </span><span>grown even more powerful. We can't fight them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This isn't about pride. If we wait too long, they'll dig up the grave. How can your mother rest in peace if that happens?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her voice broke as she wiped her tears away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander sighed heavily, his hand resting on the worn stone of the grave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lily, don't worry. No one is touching my mom's grave. I promise you that."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His voice was low but firm, the kind of certainty that only someone who had made up their mind could have.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom, don't worry. If anyone dares touch you, they'll regret it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily, overwhelmed, just shook her head. "Why are you so stubborn?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander gave a faint smile. Despite the tension, he appreciated Lily's concern. She was always looking out for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily knew Alexander's stubbornness all too well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once he set his mind on something, nothing could change it. She knew pushing him further would only make things worse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a heavy sigh, she accepted it and stopped trying to argue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fine, fine. We'll wait until the day after tomorrow. We'll bring more family members. Even if I have to fight them, I'll protect this grave!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Ava, still frowning, wasn't convinced. The situation was spiraling out of control. The next few days could bring a storm unlike anything they were prepared for.</span></p><div class="pagination">
