  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thunder rumbled through the night sky, signaling the approach of a storm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the darkness, the wind howled and rain poured down heavily. Bruno's small wooden hut swayed precariously in the storm, as if it could collapse at any moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a loud thunderclap, a crimson light shot up from the small wooden hut.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The roof of the small wooden hut suddenly exploded, scattering debris into the rain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh my God, I succeeded!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bruno laughed maniacally, and the machete was completely different from before, now exuding an eerie blood-red glow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, your time has come. I will take Ava back from you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bruno's voice was resolute as he slashed at the small wooden hut behind him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a loud boom, the small wooden hut collapsed, leaving only a pile of ruins and a terrifying gash in the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bruno, carrying the blade, walked towards the center of Loscity. His dashing figure soon vanished into the wind and rain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the morning, Alexander's family was filled with joy. Ashley kept making Ava laugh nonstop.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Daddy, goodbye! Mommy is taking me to kindergarten!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ashley, holding Ava's hand, said goodbye to Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah? You called me mom?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava was stunned for a few seconds before coming to her senses, her face flushed with happiness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What a cutie pie!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She picked up Ashley and kissed her on the cheek.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After getting in the car, Ashley said to Ava in a childishly sweet voice, "When will you be my mommy? We can't let other women take Daddy away."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava smiled helplessly at the mature little child.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Silly Mommy, don't worry. I'll help you. I'll make sure Daddy only marries you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ashley snuggled in Ava's arms with a giggly smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not only did Ava cover her mouth and laugh, but even the driver and bodyguard couldn't help but chuckle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After sending Ashley to kindergarten, Ava arrived at the Saint Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From afar, Bruno hid around the corner, watching the familiar Rolls Royce drive up and park in Ava's designated spot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The car door opened, and first to emerge was a pair of long, beautiful legs in black stockings, utterly enchanting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, the stunningly figured Ava stepped out. Her dress clung to her body, accentuating her model-like, mature and alluring figure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava had become increasingly skilled at dressing herself and exuded the unique charisma of a leader.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Power and money were the best elixirs for men to maintain their youth, and the same applied to women.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava clearly understood what kind of clothes best suited her status and how to perfectly showcase her stunning figure and charm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, the Saint Group, backed by the Ultimate Alliance, with its two best-selling products, magic powder and beauty ointments, had seen its market value grow to three hundred billion dollars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not only was it the largest group company in Loscity, but it also stood as a top-tier entity on a global scale.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Ava deeply understood that it was all because of Alexander that she had attained her current status.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as she got out of the car, someone presented her with a large bouquet of bright red roses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At first, she thought it was from Alexander, and her face lit up with joy. Everyone in Loscity knew about her relationship with Alexander, and no one dared to compete with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava glanced at the card, which was signed by Bruno.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bruno? I don't know him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava let out a disdainful laugh and directly threw the bouquet of roses into the trash bin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bruno saw everything, and it made him so angry that he felt like he was going to burst with rage, gripping the hilt of his knife tightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn Alexander! It's all because of you that Ava rejected me. Ava, why are you willingly being deceived by him? He has clearly played around with so many women! Go to hell!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Ava walked into the Saint Tower, Bruno was still standing there, reluctant to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, I'm waiting for you right here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bruno caressed the sharkskin scabbard, looking extremely fierce.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, Alexander arrived at the headquarters of the Ultimate Alliance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The strength of the Ultimate Alliance was growing by leaps and bounds, with its numbers in Loscity alone exceeding five thousand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adding the manpower from Treasure Island, the total had reached tens of thousands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The elite special force, selected and formed from the best, had also expanded to a thousand members.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After rigorous training by Marvin, the skills of each special force member were absolutely no less than those of the Phantom Squad members.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Alexander occupied Treasure Island, the Ultimate Alliance gained a sufficient supply of weapons, which were transported to Loscity through special channels.</span></p><div class="pagination">
