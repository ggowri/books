  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course, Carl, I'll do whatever you want and make sure you're happy!" Alin forced a smile, pressing her curvy body against Carl.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander happened to witness the whole scene, and there was no way he could just walk away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He remembered Alin from their last class reunion</span><span>&mdash;</span><span>she'd seemed like a decent person, plus this involved her son.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carl wrapped his arms around Alin, pawing at her as they headed down an alley. Alexander followed quietly behind them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They weaved through several turns before ending up on a deserted street. The place was totally dead, lined with run-down buildings that looked ready to collapse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alin felt uneasy but kept her mouth shut.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Right in here!" Carl's face twisted into an ugly grin as he yanked her inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Boss, check out what I brought!" Carl shouted eagerly as he shoved the door open.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The room was dim, curtains drawn. Six or seven guys were sprawled around in various positions, the air thick with smoke. At Carl's shout, a burly man lounging on the couch slowly lifted his head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The guy had a nasty scar across his forehead, about as long as a hand. His eyes shifted from glazed to razor-sharp in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's with all the noise, Carl? Where'd you find this chick?" the man snapped coldly, but his expression shifted the moment his eyes landed on Alin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, well. This one's got something special," he said, his eyes roaming over Alin's curves, lingering especially on her breasts as he licked his lips hungrily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Carl, what... what's going on? I thought we were going to get a room?" Alin's face went pale as she backed away, realizing something wasn't right.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't move." Carl grabbed her arm, a nasty grin spreading across his face. "Hey Alin, didn't you just say you'd do anything to save your son?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Instead of sleeping with me, why not serve my boss, Raymond, here? If Raymond's happy, who knows? Maybe he'll let your kid have that kidney transplant."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alin froze. "Really?" she asked carefully. "Raymond can actually arrange the kidney transplant for my son?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Raymond stroked his chin, letting out a creepy laugh. "Oh, so it's a kidney transplant for your kid, huh? That's easy enough. Two million dollars and the kidney's yours."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alin dropped to her knees instantly. "Sir, please. I can't possibly get two million dollars. I'll do anything you want. Just please, save my son."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Raymond leaned in close to Alin, cupping her cheek with his hand and trailing his fingers down her neck. His lips curved into a sleazy grin. "Listen, beautiful. You take good care of me and my boys, make sure we're all satisfied... I'll get you not just one kidney, but two if that's what you want."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Really? But... but I don't want to sleep with everyone..." Alin trembled. The thought of being used by all of them was her absolute limit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alin, your son's life is at stake. You really think you have a choice here?" Carl's voice dripped with contempt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Raymond's hand slipped inside her collar, grabbing and roughly squeezing her breast.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alin froze in terror, feeling like she'd been struck by a snake. Her skin crawled with revulsion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's the difference between one guy or ten?" Raymond's voice was thick with malice. "It's all the same thing. You might even enjoy it more."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The men started closing in, their intentions clear as day.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alin yanked herself free and scrambled back against the wall. "Please... don't do this. Raymond, I can sleep with you. But not... not all of you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ha! Then why are you running away?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Raymond's eyes raked over her like a wolf sizing up its prey, ready to lead his pack in for the kill.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, stop it! I have my limits. Don't force me</span><span>&mdash;</span><span>I'll call the police!" Alin pleaded through her tears, shaking her head desperately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Step by step, they backed her into a corner until despair overwhelmed her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, well. Sweetheart, you're not calling the shots anymore," Carl sneered and grabbed Alin, his hands roaming everywhere as Alin screamed in terror.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Raymond lunged forward, too, latching onto her breasts and violently squeezing them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Run all you want. Let's see how far you get."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Weren't you </span><span>gonna</span><span> call the cops? Go ahead, call them. Let's see who comes to save you. You think you can just walk out of here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We'll have our fun with you for a few months. Once we're bored, we'll harvest your organs. Should fetch a few million dollars, easy."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The group crowded around Alin, pawing at her while they taunted her with cruel laughter.</span></p><div class="pagination">
