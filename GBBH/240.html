  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The trading center had quieted down from its usual daytime hustle, now lying in solitude. Alexander waited in a dim corner nearby, watching for an opportunity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a while, several members of the Brilliant Group emerged from the trading center, chatting and laughing as they headed his way. They were discussing their plans for the night, clearly looking to have some fun.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander recognized the bald man leading the group&mdash;Peter, a minor leader of the underground guards at the trading hall. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was tall and muscular, with a fierce scorpion tattoo on his left cheek that was hard to forget. The other four were guards too, with concealed guns at their waists or strapped to their legs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Peter warned his companions, "You guys better behave later. That new dancer is mine first. Don't try to compete with me, got it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A long-faced man named Tom grinned, "Peter, we won't compete with you, but can you take us to the underground for some fun? I heard Lynne tried to leave the island and got caught. I've been wanting to see her for a long time. Can you make it happen?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Peter rolled his eyes. "The underground dungeon isn't a playground. Those locked up there are the disloyal. Only supervisors and above are allowed in."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tom sighed, "What a pity. I'll never make it to supervisor."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hiding in the shadows, Alexander frowned at the mention of Lynne. He remembered her as the salesperson who had helped him. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed there was a prison underground for those trying to escape Treasure Island. Alexander, being a supervisor, had access, but his priority was finding Guzman, not risking exposure for a stranger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Did you hear?" Tom said. "The guy Lynne helped yesterday got appointed as head of security&mdash;our new boss."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Peter's eyes narrowed with fierce intent. He suddenly grabbed Tom, slamming him against the wall. "Remember! The boss's orders aren't to be questioned or gossiped about. If you do, I'll have to deal with you myself."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The others looked at Tom indifferently, as if he were already a dead man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Peter, I'm sorry. I won't do it again," Tom pleaded, knowing the Brilliant Group's rules: if the boss heard of his words, not only he but his superiors and companions would be in serious trouble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Peter snorted, throwing him to the ground. He was puzzled. "That young guy seems like a weakling. How did he become head of security? Could he be hiding his strength?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shaking off the thought, Peter said, "Let's go. Enough talking. I promised you guys&mdash;the dancer is mine for the first half of the night, and yours in the second."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The group continued towards the island's red-light district, a lively area with bars and casinos. As they passed the alley, Alexander stepped out of the shadows.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who's there!?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Peter and his group were startled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hand over all your weapons. Don't resist," Alexander said, his pocket watch swinging rapidly, creating a hypnotic effect. The combination of his command and the watch left the group dazed and motionless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hand over all your weapons!" Alexander repeated, the watch swinging faster, leaving afterimages.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Peter and his group obediently placed their weapons on the ground, staring blankly at Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was thrilled. Controlling five guards at once with his Force Control was a significant achievement. "Do you know where John is?"</span></p><div class="pagination">
