  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paxton suddenly grabbed the mug and smashed it to the floor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing the noise, the guards outside immediately rushed in but were scolded by Paxton and quickly retreated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Axe suddenly grew in strength and took over more than half of the gem mines and exchanges in Mandale Town.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even some small forces volunteered to join them, adding to their momentum.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, Paxton, unaware of what they held, did not dare to act rashly.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The senior executives of the Axe had gone from timid to confident.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, thank you so much! Without you, the Axe would have been destroyed, not to mention the current glory."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alyssa was extremely grateful to Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He smiled, "You're welcome. I have conditions. I will have Xavier as my representative."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had gained a lot from last night's operation, including gems worth hundreds of millions of dollars from Jagger of the Glory Association and an anonymous cash check of ten billion dollars from Southern Mining.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry. We have already decided to give you half of our shares and will do our best to collect the top-grade gems you need."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alyssa did not let victory go to her head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Given Alexander's strength and the ease with which he was able to destroy the two main armies, he could ruin the Axe at any time.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Axe's current success was almost the result of his efforts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the face of such a powerful being, they had no choice but to curry favor with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alyssa was well aware that the Axe would be able to unify Mandale Town as long as Alexander eliminated the other forces. Even if they gave away half of their shares, it was still a lucrative deal for them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He nodded with satisfaction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay. From now on, Xavier will be my representative in the Axe."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Alyssa and Alexander had reached an agreement, the room suddenly became quiet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He sized her up, his sight starting from her plump and full breasts and working its way, past her slender waist, her round and full buttocks, to her striking legs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her calves were long and straight, close together, in perfect proportion to the length of her thighs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her round knees formed two soft arcs, and there was not a trace of superfluous fat on her thighs, which were nevertheless plump.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alyssa sensed Alexander's burning gaze, and her pretty face instantly blushed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He asked with a grin, "Do you like me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alyssa nodded vigorously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, but I don't want to compete with Alice because a man like you will definitely not have only one woman. So, I think it's better for me to be your lover."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alyssa, you are so smart. Look into my eyes."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's tone was very gentle, but Alyssa couldn't help but obey him and raise her head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She uttered a soft cry, and the sight of the fire of desire in his eyes warmed her all over.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He pulled her over, hugged her soft waist, and bent down to kiss her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alyssa gently stroked Alexander's chest, her red lips slightly parted, allowing his tongue to swirl in her mouth.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her little bit of consciousness disappeared as time passed. Her mind went blank, and the raging desire overwhelmed her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander slipped his hand under Alyssa's skirt, rubbed her thighs, which felt great, and then went deeper, covering her labia and caressing them.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She took the initiative to unzip her miniskirt, exposing her voluptuous body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander took off his shirt and hugged Alyssa, their bodies pressed tightly together.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She completely relaxed and put her hands on her buxom breasts, eagerly kneading and pressing them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander pressed his whole body against Alyssa and suddenly sank his buttocks.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Overcome by a great pleasure, she could not help but clutch the sheet tightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>An hour later, Alexander walked out of Alyssa's room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The guards outside had strange expressions on their faces and hung their heads, not daring to glance up at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seductive moans and violent flapping had just come from the room, and they all knew what was going on inside.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As men, they were jealous, but no one dared to show a trace of displeasure.</span></p><div class="pagination">
