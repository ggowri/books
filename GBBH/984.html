  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gavin's expression changed instantly, and he quickly decided he should side with Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Asher, still unwilling to give up, loudly accused, "Alexander, you clearly tried to kill Mr. Gavin Lawson just now. Everyone saw you stab his heart. You're nothing but a murderer!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander smirked and showed an expression full of mockery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Asher, it's too bad you don't know. Mr. Gavin Lawson's heart isn't in the same position as an ordinary person's. Most people's hearts are on the left, but his heart is closer to the right.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"And the two strikes I stabbed just now didn't injure his lungs. If you want to ask me how I did it, I don't see the need to tell you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander's confident explanation almost pissed Asher off to death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gale immediately nodded in agreement and said, "Yes, yes, it's amazing! How did you know my father's heart is on the right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone was stunned. They didn't expect that there would be such a thing in the world. It turned out Gavin's heart was not on the left but on the right.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Asher's expression was extremely dark, and he was speechless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But he didn't give up. After thinking for a while, he said, "Didn't I just make Mr. Gavin feel much better? Maybe the effect of your treatment can only last for a while. We can't conclude yet that you have truly healed him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Hmph!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gavin let out a displeased snort and straightened his back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Asher, I feel perfectly fine right now. There's no need for you to question Alex."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing Gavin call him by his full name so bluntly, Asher knew it was all over. It was clear that Gavin now favored Alexander, not him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone else picked up on this shift and quickly began to flatter Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne, you are truly a skilled doctor!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Amazing! You can even cure such a severe condition. Mr. Hawthorne, you are amazing!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Isn't it said that Asher is a genius? I think Mr. Hawthorne is the real genius here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Asher listened to the praises directed at Alexander and the ridicule aimed at him, his face turning extremely dark. Rage consumed him, and he wished he could destroy Alexander on the spot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander turned to Asher and said coldly, "Now that you've lost, can you just get out of Loscity? Trash like you dares to mess with my mother's grave? Keep dreaming!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Asher was stunned for a moment, then burst out laughing and pointed at Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He said, "Hahaha, so that grave belongs to your family? Fine, very well. I will dig up your family's grave tomorrow and use your mother's bones to feed the dogs."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Grace shouted angrily, "Asher, you are shameless!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Shameless? Alexander is the one who's shameless! Clearly, I was the one who healed Mr. Gavin Lawson, but he secretly poisoned him and then pretended to cure him, stealing my credit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Alexander, why don't you bow and beg me not to touch your mother's grave?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Asher's smug expression made Alexander furious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Alexander held back, a smirk playing on his lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Asher, I would like to see how you plan to mess up my mother's grave tomorrow."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ridiculous!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Asher rolled his eyes in disdain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The West Cemetery will belong to the Vance family tomorrow. Let's see if I can't dig up that grave."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You are shameless!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You scumbag!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Grace and Madelyn were both furious with Asher, their faces flushed with anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gavin remained silent, but his gaze toward Asher was filled with disappointment and coldness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He had made up his mind to support Alexander in this matter. After all, he would need Alexander to prolong his life after two years.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Guards, escort him out!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gavin gave an order.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Suddenly, a group of bodyguards swarmed in and surrounded Asher.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Vance, please leave immediately. Don't make this harder on us."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Asher was so angry that his face alternated between pale and flushed, but he did not dare to vent his anger on Gavin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Asher, I will never like someone as vile as you. Get out!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Grace's harsh words turned Asher's face crimson with humiliation. He wanted to retort but could not find the words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even Ave lowered her head and kept silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Fine... just wait and see... this is not over yet!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Asher, humiliated and enraged, threw out a final threat before leaving with his entourage in defeat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He had originally thought tonight would be his moment to shine, to win the girl of his dreams.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He never expected that not only Alexander steals the spotlight but even the Lawson family would no longer have a good impression of him, and his marriage to Grace was completely ruined.</span></p><div class="pagination">
