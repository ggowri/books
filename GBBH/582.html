I saw his car earlier. Who else is here besides Clay?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy linked arms with Alexander as they walked inside, asking Marlon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your grandfather, your parents, your aunt, your sister, and dozens of relatives are all here," Marlon replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clay had arrived early with a clear goal: to set a wedding date with Nancy on this special day.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was decked out in designer clothes, holding a glass of red wine and sipping it occasionally.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet he exuded a rustic vibe, likely due to his upbringing in the City of Sorcery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite his attempts at refinement, he still lacked a certain sophistication.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clay needed extensive training and education to truly change and develop an elegant demeanor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Kaylon members pretended to respect Clay, but in reality, they looked down on him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy's grandfather, Richard Reynolds, was eighty this year and had a history of coronary heart disease.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But since Clay became Nancy's future husband, he had become the old man's personal doctor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under Clay's care, Richard's symptoms had nearly vanished, and his health had gradually improved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Many in the Reynolds family also credited their recovery to Clay, who, as a dark wizard, was skilled not only in magic but also in healing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Richard held Clay in high regard, knowing he was close friends with the elder of the City of Sorcery, Rock Rossetti. He knew that Clay was not just a disciple of Rock but also a junior to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Therefore, Richard readily agreed to his friend's request to arrange a betrothal between Clay and Nancy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Nancy married him, the Kaylon and the City of Sorcery would form a powerful alliance, setting the stage for a prosperous future!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These thoughts filled Richard with joy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Clay, how are things going with Nancy?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Richard asked with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In his eyes, Clay was a great catch&mdash;handsome and capable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although he lacked a bit of charm, that wasn't a major concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Uh, things are going well..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clay stammered, unsure of what to say, his focus entirely on Sophie Pepys.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had never met Sophie before, and it was his first time seeing her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Sophie had just walked in, Clay was completely stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He realized that the famous influencer Sophie was Nancy's half-sister, and it made his heart race.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under Rock's strict watch in the City of Sorcery, he had been buried in studying </span><span>magic, barely getting a chance to touch his phone or computer&mdash;he felt completely out of the loop.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So</span><span> when he finally stepped outside, he was utterly captivated by the stunning women around him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, being married to Nancy meant Sophie would be his family, and that could open up some exciting possibilities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thought of the three of them sleeping together set his mind ablaze with fantasies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sophie had an alluring presence, dressed in a figure-hugging mini-dress that accentuated her curves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clay couldn't take his eyes off her full chest and felt his heart race, wishing he could be close to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was stunning, flawless from head to toe&mdash;a true gem.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No less beautiful than Nancy, and the fact that she would be his family was overwhelming!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clay felt he was on cloud nine; life was looking good for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though Sophie didn't glance his way, Clay was filled with confidence, believing this influencer would eventually be his.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Clay, what are you thinking about?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Richard called out, still smiling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clay snapped back to reality and quickly apologized, "Grandpa Richard, I'm really sorry. I didn't expect Sophie to be Nancy's sister; it took me by surprise. Sophie is absolutely stunning."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Haha!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nearby, Richard's son, Luther, laughed proudly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My daughters are, of course, talented and beautiful."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sophie's mother, Clara, added with a smile, "With someone as capable as Clay, it's a shame my daughter doesn't have that kind of luck."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, Clay felt as if he had eaten honey, thinking that perhaps his dream of having both sisters was within reach.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"For Christ's sake."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Sophie scoffed and shot him a disdainful look, cursing silently.</span></p><div class="pagination">
