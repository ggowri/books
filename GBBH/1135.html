  <div class="container"><p style="text-align:left;">After the ambush, the team&#x27;s morale didn&#x27;t falter despite the casualties. In fact, the loss only fueled their determination to fight harder in the future.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Marvin pulled out his phone. &quot;I&#x27;ll notify Boss and have someone sent for backup.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">William nodded. &quot;Good. These supplies are crucial. We can&#x27;t afford any mistakes.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">*****</p><p style="text-align:left;">Alexander was stunned when he received Marvin&#x27;s call.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Louvian Port wasn&#x27;t far from Loscity, and the ambush happened so close. Sakra Society was getting too bold.</p><p style="text-align:left;">He immediately called for Augusta to lead a team of elite soldiers, splitting them across several helicopters to provide support.</p><p style="text-align:left;">At the same time, Alexander ordered Betty to deploy every available agent to search for Sakra Society&#x27;s hideouts in Loscity.</p><p style="text-align:left;">They were known for poison and ambushes, and Alexander was certain they had a secret base in the city.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Alexander also called on Kaylon, the four prominent families of Loscity, and the police to coordinate in tracking down any clues.</p><p style="text-align:left;">After hours of activity, Betty arrived and reported, &quot;Sir, we haven&#x27;t found any sign of Sakra Society members. What should we do?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Alexander frowned slightly, pacing the room.</p><p style="text-align:left;">He was certain Sakra Society had set up a base in Loscity, but finding it was like looking for a needle in a haystack.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Suddenly, his eyes lit up. &quot;I&#x27;ll contact Brittany. She can help us check the city&#x27;s water bills. That&#x27;s how we&#x27;ll find them!&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Betty&#x27;s eyes widened. &quot;I can&#x27;t believe I didn&#x27;t think of that. Sakra Society couldn&#x27;t have been here long, and with so many people, their water usage must be through the roof.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;We just need to find a place where the water consumption has spiked recently. That&#x27;s where they&#x27;ll be!&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Soon, through Brittany&#x27;s connections in the military, Alexander got his hands on Loscity&#x27;s water data.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Betty scanned the massive sheets of data, her eyes starting to blur. &quot;I&#x27;ll gather a team to go through this and pinpoint the suspicious areas.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Alexander waved her off. &quot;No need. I&#x27;ve already found it.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">He pointed to a specific address on the report. It was a food processing plant in a small town south of the city.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Betty&#x27;s mouth hung open in shock. She had no idea what to say.</p><p style="text-align:left;">With so much data, even dozens of people working together would&#x27;ve struggled to spot something this quickly.</p><p style="text-align:left;">But Alexander had glanced at the sheet and found the anomaly almost immediately.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;This factory&#x27;s water usage has tripled in the last half month, and it&#x27;s not far from where the convoy was ambushed. It&#x27;s definitely there!&quot; Alexander&#x27;s eyes gleamed with cold fury.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Once he had a location, he immediately ordered Betty to prepare a team while he himself got into his black BMW Seven Series. Like a dark stallion, he disappeared into the night.</p><p style="text-align:left;">The highway stretched out before him as the BMW raced through the night, the world outside blurring by.</p><p style="text-align:left;">The pale moon above seemed to sense Alexander&#x27;s murderous intent, slipping behind a cloud to hide.</p><p style="text-align:left;">At that very moment, three black SUVs were parked at the entrance of the food processing plant.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Dax, it&#x27;s time to go. We&#x27;ve lost contact with everyone. Things don&#x27;t look good. I bet it won&#x27;t be long before Ultimate Alliance tracks us down,&quot; a burly, brown-haired man said from the driver&#x27;s seat, eyes cold as he watched Dax standing outside.</p><p style="text-align:left;">The muscular man&#x27;s shirt was half-unbuttoned, his powerful physique on full display. His square jaw was set in a grim expression, with no hint of a smile on his face.</p><p style="text-align:left;">His brown eyes were filled with unmasked hostility as he glared at Dax.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Mr. Malone, do you really think they&#x27;ll come? Is that even possible?&quot; Dax wiped the sweat from his brow, still in disbelief.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Tyler Malone snorted derisively, &quot;We underestimated Ultimate Alliance. Alexander is beyond dangerous. We came with forty men, and now we&#x27;re down to half.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;If we don&#x27;t leave now, they&#x27;ll find us, and they&#x27;ll kill us one by one!&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Dax&#x27;s face went pale, his voice shaky as he stammered, &quot;Then... what about the one million dollars you promised me? Shouldn&#x27;t I get that?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Tyler&#x27;s temper flared. He pulled out his gun and pressed it to Dax&#x27;s forehead, sneering, &quot;You greedy bastard! We only stayed in your warehouse for a short time, and we already gave you 200 thousand dollars. Now, you want a million dollars?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Dax opened his mouth to scream, but before he could, the gunshot rang out.</p><p style="text-align:left;">The sharp sound shattered the stillness of the night, sending birds flying in all directions.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Dax&#x27;s head exploded, and his lifeless body collapsed to the ground with a heavy thud.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Tyler didn&#x27;t even spare the corpse a second glance. He slammed his foot down on the gas, and the SUV roared to life.</p><p style="text-align:left;">The other two vehicles followed closely behind, speeding off into the night, headed east.</p><div class="pagination">
