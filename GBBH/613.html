Alexander chuckled, tenderly helping Olivia sit up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stunned, Olivia burst into tears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm so useless... I can't even serve a man right... You won't abandon me, will you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sobbing, she burrowed into Alexander's embrace, finding solace in his arms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander stroked her hair, comforting her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't cry. I'll help you get your revenge. Come, I'll take you to a hotel to rest."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He then kissed her tenderly, their lips parting with a translucent string of saliva connecting them as if reluctant to separate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Alexander drove, he inquired about Olivia's family and the secret exchange, gaining deeper insights.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Rest assured, I'll reclaim the exchange for you tomorrow!" he assured her resolutely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Olivia's eyes lit up with excitement&mdash;it was the family business she didn't want to lose.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If her parents knew she had regained the exchange, they would be thrilled, even from heaven.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, Alexander pulled up to a five-star hotel, guiding Olivia to the front desk to book </span><span>a presidential suite.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Olivia gasped, "This is too expensive; we can get a smaller room."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander merely smiled, slipping the key card into her hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The hotel clerk watched Olivia with envy&mdash;a suite costing thousands of dollars a night was beyond most people's reach.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Olivia felt the envious glances of the staff, a sweet sense of pride filling her heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vanity was human, and which woman wouldn't want a man of status, position, and power?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander had saved her and even declined her offer; a man of such caliber was hard to find.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Olivia's heart leaned towards Alexander as she became increasingly fond of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander led her to the elevator; Olivia felt the clerk's jealous gaze, which filled her with indescribable pride.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought, "Do you envy me? </span><span>He's</span><span> my man!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inside the suite, Olivia immediately said, "You must wait for me; I have important things to tell you. I'm going to take a quick shower, wait for me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, she hurried into the bathroom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Something important?" Alexander pondered, deciding to sit down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had intended to leave immediately, knowing Ashley was home and Ava was likely waiting for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>About twenty minutes later, Olivia emerged, her hair wet and wrapped in a towel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, hold me!" she said, burrowing into his embrace, the scent of shower gel filling the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander gently patted her shoulder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You should rest.

He glanced at the wall clock; perhaps there was still time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Olivia dropped her towel, her voluptuous body fully exposed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sensitive flesh pressed against Alexander's heated dick, which quickly hardened, a wave of pleasure coursing through him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, I didn't serve you well earlier. Give me another chance, please?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Olivia had placed Alexander's comfort above her own shame, proud to offer her body to him.</span></p><div class="pagination">
