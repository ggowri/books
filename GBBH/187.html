  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's you! What the hell are you doing here?" Lillian recognized Alexander immediately, her voice sharp with anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ian, this guy tricked the Fairfax family out of millions! You need to help me get our money back!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She pouted, shaking Ian's arm like a spoiled child.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ian smirked, patting her thigh casually.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That so-called Ultimate Alliance of yours? I wiped the floor with them. Lucky for you, you weren't there, or you'd have been begging me for mercy."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Augusta couldn't hold back his laughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You had over a hundred men, and we had just twenty. You lost dozens, and you couldn't even breach our front door. And you still have the nerve to brag?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shut up!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ian slammed his hand down on the table, his face turning a deep shade of red, like a ripe tomato.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I suggest you hand over the magic powder recipe if you want to walk out of here alive," he warned, his voice low and threatening.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In response, Alexander kicked the coffee table aside with a swift motion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Drinks and snacks went flying, leaving Ian and Lillian in a mess.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ian, you hurt one of my buddies, and I always settle scores. Today, you're a dead man."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's voice dripped with icy menace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ian took a step back, momentarily startled, but then a cruel smile spread across his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You've got some guts, but you're too stupid to know when you're in over your head."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he clapped his hands three times.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, the corridor erupted with the sound of heavy footsteps and angry shouts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Augusta's expression shifted to alarm. "Oh no! We're ambushed!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Boss, we'll cover you! You need to get out of here!" Marvin shouted, urgency in his voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ian laughed triumphantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now you want to run? Too late! I'm about to catch you all like fish in a barrel."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A mob of people surged into the room, filling the corridor with a sea of men&mdash;at least a hundred strong.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each one brandished </span><span>weapons</span><span>: machetes, baseball bats, axes, and more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, now you see just how powerful I am? Hand over the magic powder recipe, and maybe I'll let you walk away," Ian said, reclining back in his chair with a smug grin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lillian, feeling emboldened, pointed a finger at Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You scam artist, give us back our money! I warn </span><span>you,</span><span> Jane's hired a top lawyer. Even if you escape today, you'll end up in jail!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get lost!" Alexander waved dismissively.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lillian let out a yelp as she stumbled backward, crashing to the floor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Augusta, Marvin, you guard the entrance. I'll handle the rest," Alexander commanded as he strode toward Ian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though he was alone, a commanding presence radiated from him, causing Ian to take several steps back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ewan, get in there! Take him down!" Ian </span><span>barked,</span><span> his voice laced with panic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A massive man with a dragon tattoo on his neck stepped forward, blocking Alexander's path like a brick wall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He cracked his knuckles, the sound echoing ominously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, I hear you're quite the freeloader. Why don't you lick my boots? Maybe I'll convince the boss to let you off the hook." Ewan Firth </span><span>sneered,</span><span> his eyes gleaming with malice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was Ian's top enforcer, a man known for taking on multiple opponents at once.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had a particular taste for delicate-looking men&mdash;Alexander fit the bill perfectly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without missing a beat, Alexander replied, "Save your breath. You all come at me together; I'll take you down."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ewan froze, his anger boiling over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, how dare you disrespect me? While I was making a name for myself in the Fraternity, you were still figuring out how to tie your shoes!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander beckoned with a casual flick of his fingers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you're in such a hurry to die, then cut the crap and come take your beating!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You little pretty </span><span>boy,</span><span> you're asking for it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ewan exploded in rage, his massive fist swinging like a sledgehammer straight for Alexander's temple.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The force of his punch created a gust of wind as it rocketed forward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This blow was swift and powerful, akin to a cannonball targeting Alexander's temple.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it connected, a concussion was the very least Ewan could expect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet,</span><span> </span><span>Alexander stood motionless, almost as if frozen in shock, completely unresponsive to the impending danger.</span></p><div class="pagination">
