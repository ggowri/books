  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cloe could feel Alexander's intense gaze on her and even hear him swallow hard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the next second, she expected Alexander to lunge forward, and she'd half-heartedly resist...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cloe let herself </span><span>daydream,</span><span> her flirtatious gaze fixed steadily on Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm full. Take your time," Alexander said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, he moved away from the table and sat back on the couch, giving Cloe an amused look.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cloe shivered, a cold sweat breaking out. If her attempt at seduction failed, would Alexander punish her?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking of Guzman's fate and what had happened to the other Bryant family members, a chill ran through her, like she'd fallen into an icy abyss.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smiled and said, "Cloe, I see what you're doing, and you're very charming, but I don't like women trying to control the pace. Understand?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cloe breathed a sigh of relief, momentarily at a loss for words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, tell me what's been happening lately on the Neptune," he ordered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cloe quickly began her report.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've taken over the Brilliant Group and eliminated Guzman's influence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But something strange has happened on the island lately. Over a dozen staff members from the trading center have gone missing one after another. Nothing like this has ever happened before..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cloe detailed the recent mysterious disappearances, explaining that fear had swept through the trading center, and operations had nearly ground to a halt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ever since magic powder had fully replaced drugs, the trading center had become one of Brilliant Group's most important sources of revenue, putting intense pressure on Cloe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Boss, what should I do now?" Cloe asked, looking at Alexander with hopeful eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfazed, Alexander asked, "Any leads?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We found a few headless bodies, but nothing else to go on."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Where are the bodies?" he asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Five bodies are stored in the freezer, but eight have mysteriously disappeared."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander frowned as he listened to Cloe's report.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was indeed strange, and even he wasn't all-knowing. He had no immediate leads.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Over a dozen people had mysteriously died, and eight bodies had gone missing. How bizarre!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What kind of killer could do something like this?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander, too, was baffled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was determined to get to the bottom of this. Someone was definitely behind it, and if he didn't uncover the mastermind, panic would spread throughout the Brilliant Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Could the people from the Red Umbrella Group be behind this?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Or could a wizard have arrived on the Treasure Island?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Buzzzz</span><span>!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Cloe's phone rang.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Bryant, another body's gone missing. They just discovered it..." Someone reported anxiously over the phone, loud enough for Alexander to hear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Another body's gone missing? There's so many of you and you still can't guard a few corpses? Did they grow wings and fly away?" she shouted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fine, I'll come over later and take a look myself. Useless!" she fumed, hanging up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't rush things. The more anxious you get, the more chaotic it'll be. Stay calm," Alexander said smoothly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cloe was still at a loss.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I assigned a team to guard the bodies, but they didn't see anything unusual. The surveillance didn't catch anything, either. This thief is clever.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Boss, why do you think the killer is murdering people and then stealing these headless bodies?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander paused, thinking for a moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a moment's reflection, Alexander said, "For some wizards, corpses can be very useful. For instance..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He paused before continuing, "There's a type of wizard called a necromancer. They practice corpse-driving techniques to turn corpses into their servants."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A necromancer?" Cloe gasped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, Cloe's face went pale with fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calmly, Alexander said, "It's very likely the Red Umbrella Group is behind this. They probably know Guzman is dead and want to shake the foundation of Brilliant Group by taking down the trading center."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cloe frowned, thinking for a moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now that you mention it, Boss, I'm starting to suspect Robert at the trading center. Since John's death, he's been running things there, and the team guarding the bodies is made up of his close allies."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's eyes lit up. "Does Robert know I'm back?"</span></p><div class="pagination">
