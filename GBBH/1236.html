  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Louvian</span><span> Port was buzzing with tension. Over a thousand dock workers and several hundred refugees moved around with grim faces. Everyone knew things were about to get ugly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Norah got to work organizing the suicide squad and strike team while others hauled supplies or dug escape tunnels. Everyone pitched in, fighting for their survival.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"God, I hope the military gets here soon," Karson muttered, bowing his head in prayer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Lord will watch over us. He won't abandon us now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Following Karson's lead, others dropped to their knees, pressing their foreheads to the ground as they prayed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It didn't take long to get the teams assembled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Norah took command of the suicide squad herself, leading a convoy of SUVs charging toward the perimeter. Their job was simple but deadly&mdash;draw the mutant beasts away from the port, whatever it took.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A strike team of over a hundred soldiers followed at a distance, taking out any monsters that hadn't been lured away by the decoys.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The operation started off like clockwork&mdash;most of the roaming mutant beasts took the bait, and the strike team had no trouble picking off the stragglers that stayed behind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As time passed, both the suicide squad and the strike team disappeared over the horizon, vanishing beyond even the reach of their binoculars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Karson felt his confidence growing. If they could keep this up, maybe they actually had a shot at wiping out all these mutant beasts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The team's success gave everyone a morale boost, and they threw themselves into their work with renewed energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Two hours flew by. Then, the peace was shattered by the roar of an engine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>An SUV came tearing toward them, screeching to a halt in front of the wall. The vehicle was covered in blood and gore&mdash;a mess of human and animal remains splattered across its frame.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The driver's door flew open with a bang, and a blood-soaked man tumbled out. He was gasping for air like he'd just run a marathon, his mouth moving but no words coming out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Karson rushed to help, calling for others to get the guy on his feet while someone grabbed water.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The driver chugged an entire bottle and took several deep breaths before he could finally string together a sentence, though he was still stuttering badly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We've got a serious situation. Ms. Chapman, along with dozens of our people, tried to lure away a pack of mutant beasts, but they got trapped near Rockwood Town. They're completely surrounded by monsters with no way out."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What? They're trapped?" Karson felt his heart stop. That was his daughter, after all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Plus, Norah had taken </span><span>Louvian</span><span> Port's finest security teams with her, and even they couldn't break free.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rockwood Town wasn't far from the port&mdash;maybe a 30-minute drive, or just over 20 if you floored it. But who could lead a rescue mission now?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Things were getting worse by the minute.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Earlier, Norah's convoy had done a solid job drawing dozens of mutant beasts away from Force Port, picking them off while they moved. It had really taken the pressure off the port's defenses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The mutants were fast, sure, but the SUVs could outrun them on open ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each vehicle was set up with a driver plus four gunners, letting them shoot while on the move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The backup </span><span>strike</span><span> </span><span>team was only about 15 minutes behind them, too, so they weren't completely on their own.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the further Norah's team got from the port, the more monsters they ran into. The situation had spiraled out of control.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The suicide squad was doing their job by drawing more and more mutant beasts away from the harbor, though the strike team was starting to lag behind, gradually increasing the gap between the two groups.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, the sharp crack of gunfire erupted from the front of the convoy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Norah spotted several vehicles that had attracted a massive horde of mutant creatures, now charging toward them in a cloud of dust.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She could make out several mutated monkeys among the pack, but that was just the start of it. The whole swarm had to be at least a thousand strong&mdash;all different kinds of twisted beasts moving like a nightmare tidal wave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Norah gritted her teeth and ordered the convoy to stand their ground. She didn't have a choice. If they ran, all those monsters would swarm straight toward the harbor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their only shot was to make a desperate stand and lead these things as far from the port as possible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Norah unleashed her full power, her sniper rifle barking again and again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each bullet was supercharged with her abilities, packing enough punch to drop any mutant with a single shot to a vital spot.</span></p><div class="pagination">
