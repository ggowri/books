  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're so beautiful, darling."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's energy seemed boundless as he leaned in closer and kissed her breast.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wait... what did you just call me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lynn's voice broke with emotion, her face flushed with both shame and vulnerability.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander chuckled softly, "I called you 'darling'&mdash;just like Ava. You're both my darlings."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lynn's embarrassment deepened; she wished she could disappear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't deserve this. I'm... I'm a disgrace."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's face turned serious. "Don't say that. You're one of the most caring women I've met&mdash;a rare beauty, an incredible mother, and an honest soul. If someone like you isn't worth cherishing, then no woman in the world is."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Really? Do you mean that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A faint glimmer of hope appeared in her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course. I want you to be happy with me, just as Ava is.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And Ava doesn't mind one bit."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This unexpected assurance struck a chord with Lynn, who fought back a fresh wave of tears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No... you're lying. Ava would be furious. She'd never forgive me for this," she whispered, her voice filled with regret.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander held her gaze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm telling you the truth. Ava herself suggested it, out of concern for you. I couldn't believe it at first. But she didn't want to see you hurt or manipulated by a man. And, </span><span>well... Ava alone can't fulfill me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander sighed deeply, his voice dropping.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I wasn't sure about it at first. But I'm a man, Lynn&mdash;and to pretend I haven't thought about you would be a lie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If both you and Ava could be by my side, I'd consider myself the luckiest man alive."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're lying! You're lying!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lynn's voice faltered as her doubts slowly began to dissolve.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Think about it. When you were crying alone, do you think Ava didn't feel it? She's your daughter, Lynn&mdash;the person closest to you. She felt every bit of your pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you keep falling into despair like this, Ava would ache for you. How could we leave you alone in </span><span>Tijuanea</span><span> like that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander held her in his arms and whispered softly in her ear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lynn watched Alexander's earnest expression, and she could tell he didn't lie. Her heart was stirred by his sincerity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Silly girl... such a silly girl!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She focused her attention on Alexander's handsome face and his well-proportioned and beautiful muscles, and couldn't help but breathe heavily again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander found the desire in her eyes, and she became even more stunning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sure enough, experience reigned supreme. Lynn's energy far surpassed that of her daughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His fingers brushed through her hair. "Don't worry. You two are family, meant to care for each other. I'll protect you both as if you're my own life."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mm..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lynn's face was lifted up, and her lips were kissed again. Her faith, which was already unsteady, completely collapsed under his persuasion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lynn's chin was gently lifted, and her lips were kissed once more. The wavering resolve she had shattered completely under Alexander's persuasion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Everything," she whispered, "my heart and my soul&mdash;I'll give it all to you, Alexander."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lynn felt relief after saying these words, her body becoming more sensitive and her desires intensifying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander kneaded her breast vigorously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Call me your love," he murmured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She hesitated, heat rising to her cheeks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I... I..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But as Alexander's fingers bore into her body, she relented, her voice soft yet certain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My love... my dearest."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She hugged Alexander tightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By morning, Lynn lay fast asleep, worn out from the intense night.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander, however, was awake and energized, feeling a surge of the Force coursing through him&mdash;a reward greater than he could have ever expected.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After the long night with Lynn, he found that this newfound Force far surpassed any </span><span>gains from meditative practice.</span></p><div class="pagination">
