  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Alexander, you're a big deal now, huh? Even the head from the Iron Cobras is afraid of you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The only one who dared talk to Alexander like that was Craig.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Suddenly, Louise stood up, her tone filled with disdain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What's so great about that? You're just mooching off women, living off them. Alexander, can you be a real man for once and stop relying on women?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As she spoke, she deliberately shot a glare at Alice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The atmosphere froze instantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Louise's words silenced the entire room, making it eerily quiet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her bitterness was obvious. She couldn't accept that Alexander had risen so far.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was a way for her to console herself, convincing herself that dumping Alexander back then had been the right decision. She didn't want to believe she had made a mistake.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Craig, visibly angry, countered, "Louise, what Alexander does is none of your damn business! Don't think that just because you're somewhat attractive, you can look down on others."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He paused before smirking. "And you? Criticizing Alexander? Everyone here knows you've been kept by the higher-ups at Pinnacle Group for years. You've even gone to the hospital to abort a few times, haven't you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The room erupted in shocked whispers. All eyes turned to Louise, filled with disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This was a bombshell. Louise had always maintained an image of elegance and sophistication among her classmates.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>That image now shattered completely, leaving her reputation in tatters.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander remained unfazed as if he had expected this all along.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He had always known the kind of person Louise was. Back then, she had left him for a wealthy heir.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Craig, you're just siding with Alexander and making stuff up!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Louise shrieked, losing her composure. Her once-arrogant expression was gone, replaced with panic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You're all just jealous of me! Slandering me! Alexander isn't anything special. He had been living under the Fairfax family's thumb, and now he's just a kept man. He's no man at all."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alice slammed her hand on the table, standing up abruptly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Louise, if you dare insult Mr. Hawthorne again, I'll make sure you're ruined!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What?! Mr. Hawthorne? Who's Mr. Hawthorne?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Louise asked, stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alice turned to Alexander and gave a respectful bow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne is the chairman of the Saint Group. I'm merely his secretary."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The revelation struck the room like lightning. Even Craig was left speechless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The men stared at Alexander, trembling in fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The women clamped their hands over their mouths, their eyes wide with disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>All gazes, filled with awe, excitement, and fear, fell on Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Craig slapped his forehead, his voice filled with regret.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"So Alexander's a low-key rich heir all along? Has he been hiding his true identity? We've been so blind, so shallow!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone had thought Alexander was a joke, relying on women for survival. But it turned out he was the real boss all along. They felt no wonder Shawn had been so terrified earlier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The stark contrast between their assumptions and reality left everyone in the room deeply shaken.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Louise was left speechless. Her arrogance vanished entirely, replaced by a pale, ashen face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This can't be true! Is he actually a super-wealthy heir? How is this possible? I can't believe it... This must be a nightmare!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She felt dizzy and couldn't even stand steadily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She didn't want to admit Alexander's identity, but the way Shawn and Alice treated him made it undeniable. She had been completely wrong about him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Regret washed over her in waves. For years, she had dreamed of marrying into wealth, only to settle for being a rich man's mistress.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And yet, the man she had once abandoned was the very kind of person she had been searching for, a super-rich heir. She had missed out and made a terrible mistake.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Louise collapsed into a chair, unable to stand any longer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Craig, on the other hand, couldn't contain his excitement. He jumped up, shouting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Alexander, you own the Saint Group? That's insane! I need your autograph. I need to stick to you like glue!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alice laughed as Craig teased her. She felt this honest guy was quite fun.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her laughter was so enchanting that her breasts seemed to sway with her movements, mesmerizing everyone in the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The men watched in a daze, feeling a mix of curiosity and envy, but quickly looked away. They didn't dare stare at Alexander's woman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander patted Craig on the shoulder, his voice calm and steady.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Don't worry. I'll help you. That's it for today's gathering. I'll be leaving now."</span></p><div class="pagination">
