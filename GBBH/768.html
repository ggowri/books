  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The bodies of Woodrow and Kerwin quickly turned cold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Taking down two ordinary sorcerers was as effortless as breathing for Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you alright? Any discomfort?" Alexander asked, turning to Alyssa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, I'm fine. But we should leave&mdash;there are still a lot of Mafia around."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alyssa, still shaken, finally snapped out of her daze at Alexander's words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She grabbed his hand, pulling him to hurry, but after being tied up for so long, her legs were numb and weak, and she stumbled forward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was quick to catch her, pulling her into his arms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her soft, alluring body pressed against him, and he couldn't resist letting his hand slide over her chest, giving a gentle squeeze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alyssa gasped, blushing. "Boss, there's danger here! Once we get out, you can touch me all you like."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her bright, sparkling eyes gazed at him, filled with a mix of worry and admiration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before they could move, the sound of hurried footsteps echoed in the hallway outside&mdash;a crowd was clearly on its way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander Hawthorne! Get out here! You're surrounded; there's no way to escape!" a voice boomed from outside, thick with menace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What now, Boss?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alyssa's face paled, realizing escape was nearly impossible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry about them. Just stay behind me. I'll handle this," Alexander said, taking her hand and striding forward with confidence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alyssa obediently followed, a mix of fear and reassurance in her heart as she watched his fearless stride.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the hallway stood a dense crowd of dozens, fully armed. Some held guns, others brandished knives, blocking the exit completely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A fierce, murderous aura filled the air&mdash;these were clearly hardened elites who had seen their share of bloodshed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even for a skilled fighter, the pressure of facing such a group of killers was undeniable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alyssa's face turned pale.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was skilled herself and trusted Alexander, but the sheer number and ferocity of these opponents made her heart pound with anxiety.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't be scared. They won't lay a finger on you," Alexander reassured her with a smile, giving her cheek a comforting squeeze before pulling her securely behind him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stepped forward alone, his broad back shielding Alyssa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She looked at him, her heart swelling with admiration&mdash;this was the kind of man she </span><span>had always dreamed of.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The leader of the group, a bald, muscular man, sneered as he glared at Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, I didn't think you'd dare meddle in Mandale Town's affairs! You've got your hands in too many places. But this time, there's no escape. Surrender now, or it'll be worse for you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though he tried to sound intimidating, the leader's eyes betrayed a hint of fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had just ambushed the Axe, killing over a hundred of their people and kidnapping Alyssa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet Alexander had tracked them down so quickly, and his guards outside were already down. The sorcerers they'd left in the room hadn't even made a sound&mdash;a clear sign of their fate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beside the bald man stood a figure cloaked in black, his face dark with anger. His voice was icy as he demanded, "Did you kill my two companions?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smirked coldly. "You came to Mandale Town to stir up trouble. Didn't think there would be consequences?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before he had finished speaking, Alexander attacked, vanishing in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He reappeared right in front of the cloaked figure, his fist flying toward the man's chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sorcerer was his first target&mdash;eliminating him was the priority.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You insolent fool, how dare you strike first?" the cloaked man roared, his body swelling as he unleashed a surge of power, hurling a punch to meet Alexander's blow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Boom!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The impact of two fierce forces meeting resounded like a hammer against steel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The cloaked figure staggered, unable to fully absorb Alexander's power, and Alexander's fist veered slightly, grazing the man's left arm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man screamed, blood pouring from the gaping wound on his arm, bone visible beneath torn flesh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander chuckled, "You're the first sorcerer who's managed to take a punch from me without losing a limb. Be proud."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The cloaked man's face twisted with rage, feeling humiliated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Go to hell!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Alexander didn't give him a chance to retaliate. He surged forward like lightning, his fist aimed squarely at the man's head.</span></p><div class="pagination">
