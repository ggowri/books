  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Madelyn quickly tugged on Avery's arm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't say that; we might actually need Alexander's help."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander laughed indifferently. "If Mr. Dukes can't help, you can still come to me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Quit boasting! Now, please excuse yourself. I need to discuss something important with Madelyn."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a stern face, Avery pushed Alexander aside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Madelyn gently comforted him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't be upset. Take a break, and if we need any help, I won't hesitate to ask."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander nodded, letting Avery off the hook for Madelyn's sake.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Madelyn was about to say something when Avery waved her hand to stop her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't say another word. Even if Alexander has some influence in Los City, this is Tijuana. And he hit Marcos; Caleb will not let this slide.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>So</span><span> we're better off not associating with Alexander to avoid being implicated."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Madelyn rolled her eyes in annoyance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I refuse to believe Marcos is so untouchable."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, come on..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Avery sighed and said, "Madelyn, this is Tijuana, not Los City. Drug dealers here run wild, and no one dares to cross Caleb the drug lord."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Madelyn frowned and began to worry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander returned to his room, patiently waiting for Walter's reply.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even through the wall, he could hear Avery and Madelyn's conversation in the next room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Drug lord Caleb?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smirked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he wanted, he could take Caleb out effortlessly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wouldn't even need to lift a finger; just a word to Quentin, and that drug lord would vanish without a trace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Around noon, Madelyn texted Alexander, saying she and Avery were heading to the restaurant to meet Janus Dukes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander shook his head. He had read the intel sent by Anne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tijuana Bank's frozen assets wouldn't be unfrozen without an order from Mr. Myers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Madelyn had clearly dressed up, wearing a black bodycon dress that highlighted her curves and full figure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her captivating, beautiful eyes sparkled, holding a trace of hidden thoughts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Marriott Hotel was a famous five-star hotel in Tijuana. The restaurant was also upscale, bustling with many diners.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luxury cars like Bentleys, Rolls-Royces, and Ferraris were parked at the entrance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madelyn!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the two arrived at the restaurant entrance, a man in a suit enthusiastically approached to greet them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Foster, this is my cousin, Roman Batts."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Madelyn quickly introduced him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Avery promptly shook hands, "Mr. Batts, thank you, truly. It's thanks to your help that we were able to arrange a meeting with Mr. Dukes."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No need to thank me..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Roman stared at his cousin Madelyn, clearly stunned by her alluring appearance, only snapping out of it after a moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, Alexander's voice suddenly sounded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Batts, are you sure Mr. Dukes really has the authority to unfreeze the funds? He isn't just bluffing, is he?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Madelyn excitedly went over. "You came too?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smiled. "It's lunchtime, can't I come for a meal?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course, of course. Why don't we all dine together?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Madelyn naturally took Alexander's arm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing this, Roman felt a pang of jealousy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked at Alexander with displeasure. "What do you mean by that? Who told you Mr. Dukes can't unfreeze the funds?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Avery pulled Alexander aside and said, annoyed, "Mr. Batts, ignore him; this guy just likes to boast."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Boast?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Roman couldn't help but sneer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My friend, a person should be grounded and not talk nonsense."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander gave a faint smile, not bothering to explain himself to someone narrow-</span><span>minded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That's how the world was; people from different levels and mindsets could not communicate. Even if I told the truth, they would think I was lying or just spouting nonsense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Madelyn quickly tugged on Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Forget it, let's not say anything. We'll see when we meet Mr. Dukes. Maybe he really can do it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madelyn, let's go!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Avery forcefully pulled Madelyn back to his side and led her into the restaurant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Roman passed by Alexander, he let out a deliberate snort, clearly signaling his disdain.</span></p><div class="pagination">
