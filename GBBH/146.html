  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian had a backup plan, proving he was quite the sly one.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While he trusted Drake, he still spent a fortune hiring a renowned expert from </span><span>Loscity</span><span>, Hugh Winslet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hugh was the owner of Tiger Fury Gym and had mastered the Eagle Claw Combat System to perfection.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Hugh clasped his fists in greeting to Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne, enemies should be reconciled rather than deepened. Can you shake hands with Mr. Sebastian Tate for my sake?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander scrutinized Hugh. Although he appeared calm on the surface, a storm of emotions churned within him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Through the Force, he sensed a mysterious energy within Hugh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was somewhat akin to the Force, though far less potent; nonetheless, Hugh was no slouch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Sebastian saw Alexander remain silent, his heart soared. He thought Alexander was intimidated by Hugh's prowess.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, Mr. Winslet is the real deal&mdash;the top fighter in </span><span>Loscity</span><span>. Let's bury the hatchet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll even promise to head back to </span><span>Sandgo</span><span> and never return to </span><span>Loscity</span><span>. I can compensate you with 100 million dollars&mdash;no, 200 million! What do you say?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander scoffed, a derisive laugh escaping him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sebastian, if you tell me </span><span>where </span><span>Guzman</span><span> was</span><span> right now, I might just consider sparing your miserable life."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian gritted his teeth. "Ha! With Mr. Winslet here, I don't believe you can lay a finger on me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The top fighter in </span><span>Loscity</span><span>? Sorry, but I've never heard of you," Alexander replied, </span><span>shaking his head with a smirk.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hugh's anger flared at those words. Those with true skills were often imbued with a certain air of self-assuredness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had heard of Alexander's skills, how even Joseph from the Cripples couldn't take Alexander down. Now that he was face to face with this cocky guy, Hugh was eager to teach Alexander a lesson.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, don't think you're something special just because you've beaten someone like Joseph. I've trained not only in combat but also in humility and respect."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, Hugh struck out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His hand snatched a bottle from the table, shattering it effortlessly, liquor splattering everywhere.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He then reached for the solid wooden table, his fingers digging into the surface, leaving five deep holes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What do you think of my Eagle Claw? How do you stack up against me?" Hugh asked, his chin lifted defiantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander feigned surprise. "Wow, that's impressive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You'd clean up on the streets for sure&mdash;no one would dare challenge you for picking up bottles."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hugh's rage ignited. "I'm giving you a chance here, but if you keep this up, I won't hold back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm telling </span><span>you,</span><span> I'm protecting Mr. Sebastian Tate and Mr. Tate today!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A smirk crept across Alexander's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Can you really? Anyone who stands in my way today is going down&mdash;simple as that."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian quickly cheered Hugh on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Winslet, even if Alexander trained from the moment he was born, he wouldn't stand a chance against you!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Take him out, and I'll sweeten the deal to 100 million!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hugh's eyes gleamed with greed. He was here for the money, and the thought of 100 million was too tempting to resist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that kind of cash, he could enjoy life to the fullest, travel the world, and live without a care.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, I've been practicing combat skills since I was five. I came to </span><span>Loscity</span><span> at twenty, and after over thirty years of training, I've beat every opponent here. Joseph is just one of my many victories. I take pride in my skills, and you've crossed the line!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hugh clenched his fist and swung it with force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander shot back with a sneer. "You're just in it for the cash, aren't you? What a joke! If you're really the best, prove it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Go ahead&mdash;knock me down. Calling yourself the top fighter is just laughable!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hugh was completely enraged now. In a flash, he lunged forward, claws extended, aiming straight for Alexander's throat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a lethal strike, sharp and deadly&mdash;if he connected, it would mean serious trouble for Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Alexander stood his ground, gathering the Force into his right hand and mirroring </span><span>Hugh's attack. With a swift motion, he reached out to meet Hugh's claw.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hugh gasped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He felt the air crackle as Alexander's simple grab produced a sound like tearing fabric.</span></p><div class="pagination">
