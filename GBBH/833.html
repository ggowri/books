  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alice quickly clung to Alexander's arm, pressing her chest against him without hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander, like a proud swan, didn't even glance at the group of ugly ducklings as he walked out, head held high.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Whispers broke out among the crowd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Alexander is amazing! Even the Saint Group belongs to his family. What kind of background does he have? Why has he been hiding his identity all this time?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Shut up! Keep your voice down. If you don't care about your life, don't drag us into it. Don't you know the Saint Group is backed by the Godfather, the one they call Reaper himself?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"No way! So, Alexander is the Godfather's son? That explains why the Saint Group's secretary of the board calls him Mr. Hawthorne."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If I'd known Alexander was the Godfather's son, I'd have polished his shoes for free!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The classmates murmured among themselves, wishing they could go back to their college days and mend their relationships with Alexander. They all regretted missing the chance to curry favor with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You're all so shallow! Back then, you looked down on Alexander. Now you're trying to cozy up to him? People like you aren't even worthy of polishing his shoes."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With that, he spat on the ground and followed Alexander out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The classmates' faces turned pale, but no one dared to retaliate. They knew Craig was close to Alexander, and offending him was out of the question.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The topic quickly shifted to Louise. The women, in particular, seized the chance to gloat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What a show tonight! Louise must have been blind back then. If she hadn't dumped Alexander for being poor, imagine how glamorous her life would be now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Exactly. Louise relied on her looks and good figure to flirt with rich men. Now, this is karma at its finest."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If I were Louise, I'd gouge out my eyes. Letting go of a man like Alexander? She might as well hang herself."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Enough talking. Let's go send Alexander off. Maybe we can still build a good relationship with him. After all, we were classmates."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Yes, good idea! I'm coming too."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Wait for me. Let's go together."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the blink of an eye, the entire group dispersed, leaving Bobby and Louise completely ignored.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Bobby was ashen-faced, trembling so hard he couldn't even stand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He was terrified. One word from Alexander and his entire family wouldn't live to see the morning sun.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Louise, on the other hand, was drowning in regret, unable to forgive herself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A group of people rushed out, finding Alexander chatting casually with Craig. They sighed in relief and thought, "Thank goodness he hadn't left yet. Missing this golden opportunity to reconcile would have been disastrous."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Alexander, we're here to see you off. Take care."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Sorry for how we treated you before. We've always respected you, really."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dozens of classmates scrambled to flatter Alexander, their faces glowing with enthusiasm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander sighed softly. Looking at their fawning expressions, he couldn't muster any interest in responding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Still, they were his college classmates. He decided not to be too harsh and gave a couple of half-hearted replies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Just then, Alice drove up in a sleek Ferrari supercar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The car's striking design and multimillion-dollar price tag instantly drew gasps of envy and admiration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander waved to Craig. "Craig, when you join the Saint Group, just come to me directly if you need anything."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With that, he got into the Ferrari and sped off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Louise happened to step outside at that moment, just in time to see Alexander driving away in the luxurious car. Her heart twisted in pain, and she collapsed onto the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She felt it hurt so much.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If only she hadn't dumped Alexander back then, she could have been the one sitting beside him, smiling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At that moment, she even felt like ending her life and starting over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The group stared blankly as the Ferrari disappeared into the night, its taillights fading into the darkness. Only when it was completely gone, did they breathe a sigh of relief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With Alexander gone, Craig immediately became the center of attention.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He had the best relationship with Alexander. Alexander's enthusiasm towards Craig had said it all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They couldn't reach Alexander's level, but Craig was on their level, so they could ingratiate themselves with Craig.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>One man grinned and said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Craig, are you free tomorrow? Come over to my place for a drink. I'll introduce you to my sister-in-law. She'd make a great girlfriend for you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before Craig could respond, another one immediately objected.</span></p><div class="pagination">
