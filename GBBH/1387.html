  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander slowly returned to his courtyard. On the Eight Immortals table in the guest hall, a silver sheet of paper&mdash;one foot square&mdash;lay neatly placed. At the top, three bold black characters stood out&nbsp;"Conscription Order."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It has been thirty years since Xhantao submitted as a vassal state. Now, news has spread that the Risunese invaders have ravaged the land, slaughtering millions, pillaging over 5,000 miles of towns and villages. No one&mdash;young or old, rich or poor&mdash;has been spared. They treat human lives like mere cattle, leaving nothing but desolation in their wake.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their cruelty knows no bounds, and if left unchecked, they will surely turn their blades toward Sahasia and Hrodvik. No person of conscience can hear of such atrocities and remain unmoved. These traitorous fiends are despised by both men and gods alike. Minister of Defense, Fermin Schneier, has received the Emperor's decree to lead an army of 500,000 and wipe out the Risunese scourge..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's blood boiled as he read the decree. He wanted nothing more than to charge into Xhantao and cut down the invaders himself!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The expedition was set for a month later. If he pushed himself, he could reach peak level-four warrior by then. With his mysterious golden energy and energy waves, he wouldn't fear most level-five warriors. This was his calling&mdash;defending his homeland and eradicating evil. If he hesitated now, his martial heart would waver, hindering his progress.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Having made up his mind, Alexander signed his name and pressed his fingerprint onto the decree. He immediately ordered Clyde to deliver it to the Outer Court's administration office.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next morning, after finishing his training, Alexander felt refreshed. He was now even closer to reaching peak level-four.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He took stock of his resources&mdash;100,000 coins, 3,000 martial virtue points, and half a chest of jewels. He didn't need any new techniques or elixirs for now. It was the perfect time to check out the Treasure House, the Beast Lodge, and the upcoming trade fair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fifteen minutes later, he arrived at the entrance of the&nbsp;Beast Lodge&nbsp;in Dominion Church.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is the Beast Lodge?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was surprised. Unlike the grand halls of the church, the Beast Lodge was a simple stone structure with gray-tiled roofing. Above the entrance, three engraved characters read:&nbsp;Beast Lodge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inside, the main hall was small&mdash;just a few dozen feet across&mdash;and completely empty. Familiar with the process, Alexander took out his silver waist token. A beam of white light shot from it, striking an empty space ahead, creating a rippling portal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he stepped through, his eyes widened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He found himself in what seemed like an entirely different world&mdash;a vast blue sky stretched endlessly above, and beneath him lay a massive courtyard paved with blue bricks. Around him, flashes of white light flickered as people moved in and out of the Beast Lodge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Countless small stone chambers stood in neat rows across the plaza. Inside, exotic beasts of all kinds were housed&mdash;warhorses, spirit priesteys, rare birds, giant crocodiles, swarms of killer bees, monstrous pythons, venomous ants...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After half an hour of browsing, Alexander estimated the plaza spanned over ten miles, with tens of thousands of stone chambers neatly categorized. Many disciples were wandering about, making their selections. Horses were the most common, and on the battlefield, they were invaluable. Maybe he should pick a warhorse?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey, come on! Take me to see the Divine Tiger!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Like that'll help you! Just don't get eaten alive."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A few lay disciples laughed as they headed forward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Divine Tiger? I don't recall seeing any tigers around. Maybe I should check it out."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander followed them and soon reached the plaza's center, where dozens of&nbsp;black stone chambers&nbsp;stood. These chambers were noticeably larger and faintly radiated a multicolored glow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hundreds of disciples wandered around, some observing, some discussing animatedly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The disciples ahead entered one of the stone chambers. On its exterior wall, the number&nbsp;28&nbsp;was carved alongside a description.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tigris, King of Beasts. Fierce and unstoppable, capable of tearing apart its enemies and devouring spirits... Once tamed, it can be stored in a Spirit Beast Bag... Price: 200,000 coins and 6,000 martial virtue points."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn! That really is the legendary Tigris? Perfect! With the discount from splitting payment between coins and virtue points, I can just afford it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander stepped into the chamber, and the scene inside was like stepping into another world. A jagged, barren cliff stood before him, its rocks sharp and ominous. At the center of the cliff was a cave entrance, roughly twice the height of a person. A few disciples stood at the entrance, peering cautiously inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Omar, you're the strongest among us. You should be the one to go in and tame it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A burly disciple in a purple robe nodded arrogantly. With a sharp exhale, his muscles tensed, and white protective energy flared around him. With a light push from his toes, he leaped into the cave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander muttered to himself,&nbsp;"Judging by his aura, he must be at peak level-three warrior."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Moments later, a thunderous tiger's roar erupted from the cave, shaking the air. Then, BANG! A loud crash echoed as the purple-robed disciple was sent flying out of the cave, tumbling across the ground like a ragdoll.</span></p><div class="pagination">
