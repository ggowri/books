  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The armed helicopter loomed </span><span>above,</span><span> its firepower utterly overwhelming. Escape seemed impossible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yvonne's witchcraft was useless against the chopper; all she could do was brace for impact.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Mafia's really underestimating me? Just one measly attack helicopter?" Alexander's calm smile betrayed a quiet confidence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without a hint of panic, he crouched and picked up a few fist-sized stones from the roadside, testing their weight in his hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Gulp." Yvonne swallowed hard, her eyes widening in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Is he planning to fight a helicopter with rocks?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She glanced nervously at the chopper. Its undercarriage bristled with air-to-ground missiles, rockets, and heavy machine guns&mdash;the kind of arsenal capable of obliterating main battle tanks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The convoy was nothing more than sitting ducks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the helicopter, a bald man sneered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill them. Now!" he barked at the pilot. "Alexander might be tough, but let's see him take on this bird!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Mafia had placed an enormous bounty on Alexander&mdash;enough to make him the top prize for any ambitious member. Whoever killed him would not only pocket millions of dollars but also secure a spot in the Mafia's upper echelon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The pilot grinned, throttling up as the helicopter closed in on Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On his screen, the missiles locked onto the convoy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All it would take was a single button press to unleash hell.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But then, something unexpected happened. Alexander swung his arm in a wide arc, hurling one of the stones toward the chopper.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The bald man burst out laughing. "Is he insane? He thinks a rock can stop us? What an idiot! Fire the missiles already and end this clown!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The pilot shared in the amusement, his mind already counting the fortune he'd earn for taking down Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Boom!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A thunderous impact rattled the helicopter. It wobbled violently, its forward motion halting as it began to tilt erratically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What the hell was that? We're hit!" The pilot's voice was laced with disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't just sit there! Shoot him! Fire the missiles!" the bald man </span><span>roared,</span><span> his smug grin replaced by panic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the pilot reached for the launch button, another rock&mdash;this one flung with uncanny precision&mdash;smashed through the windshield and struck him square in the face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blood splattered across the cockpit as the pilot's head all but disintegrated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His lifeless body slumped over the controls, leaving the bald man drenched in gore and paralyzed with shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before he could recover, a third stone, imbued with crushing force, punched through the helicopter's lower frame and obliterated the control console.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No! I don't want to die!" the bald man screamed in terror, desperately clawing at the joystick in a futile attempt to regain control.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The helicopter spun wildly, its descent becoming an uncontrollable spiral.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With alarms blaring and the ground rushing up, the chopper plummeted like a drunken giant, finally crashing into a grove of trees.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>An enormous explosion erupted, sending a fireball skyward and igniting the forest in a roaring inferno.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yvonne and the others stared in stunned </span><span>silence,</span><span> their disbelief mirrored in their wide eyes. Alexander had just brought down a heavily armed attack helicopter with nothing but a handful of stones.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Unbelievable... Truly remarkable..." Yvonne exhaled, her voice trembling with awe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her gaze softened, filled with adoration. "You really are incredible, Master..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander brushed off the praise with a dismissive grunt. "It's not over yet. Looks like the Mafia's got a bigger foothold in </span><span>Tijuanea</span><span> than I thought. Damn Timothy&mdash;what a useless idiot."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He cast his eyes toward the distant road, where another convoy of vehicles approached at high speed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Timothy, the Mafia's local leader in </span><span>Tijuanea</span><span>, had long been under Alexander's control.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If the Mafia was mobilizing this kind of force without warning, it could only mean one thing&mdash;Timothy had betrayed him.</span></p><div class="pagination">
