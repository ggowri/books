  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Go ahead, try it," Rock sneered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"See if your remote has any signal."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shadow's face darkened as he checked his remote. Sure enough, there was no connection.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not just the remote was dead. Every communication device, phone, walkie-talkie, and satellite phone all showed no signal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It had to be the Demon Summoning Array, causing interference across the entire area.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rock's mocking smile faded, replaced by murderous intent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're all going to die today! After I kill you all, I'll catch that brat Alexander, flay him alive, and take both the Primal Staff and the Spirit Beads for myself."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hahaha!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rock's laughter boomed arrogantly through the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You'll all become sacrifices to the Great Being! You should feel honored this is your destiny..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feeling the pressure mount, Shadow kept his eyes locked on Rock. The Grand Elder of the City of Sorcery was formidable indeed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Arrogant fool!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shadow bent his knees slightly, gathering power and ready to strike at any moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Demon Summoning Array was active now. They had no idea how Alexander was doing down there, but they needed to take Rock down first.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"BOOM!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The air exploded as Shadow struck, charging at Rock like a fierce tiger. His punch tore through the air with devastating force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmph, you think that's enough to kill me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rock opened the Ancient Grimoire, releasing a stream of black mist that collided violently with Shadow's fist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The clash of these two powerful forces rang out like clashing steel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You've got decent martial skills, but too bad you ran into me. To a true wizard, you martial artists are nothing but brute force without finesse!" Rock sneered as the black mist from the grimoire enveloped him completely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shadowy figures emerged from the dark fog. Multiple dark-clad figures formed a crescent formation around Shadow, radiating an increasingly sinister aura.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shadow didn't stay idle, throwing punch after punch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But no matter how powerful or fast his strikes were, the dark figures blocked every single one, making it impossible to reach Rock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Alexander were here, his All-seeing Eyes would reveal these weren't human at all, but monsters formed from dark energy, lacking even human faces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The dark figures moved with supernatural speed, not only blocking Shadow's attacks but launching counterattacks that forced him back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite being among the most potent fighters alive, Shadow, whose punches could bend steel plates like paper, couldn't get past these mysterious assailants.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rock commanded, pointing at Shadow. More dark figures materialized, rushing at Shadow from every angle imaginable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Die!" Shadow roared, spitting out a mouthful of blood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was blood from biting his tongue, a technique mastered by true martial arts experts. Their blood, charged with pure yang energy, could dispel evil spirits.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The blood spray hit three of the dark figures, vaporizing them instantly like fire melting ice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shadow coughed up another mouthful of blood as he took down five more of the masked attackers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He staggered backward while Rock, face drained of color, also stumbled back several steps.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their clash had clearly left both fighters badly wounded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The remaining five attackers charged at Shadow with murderous intent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosalia and Charlize rushed forward to help, blocking the attackers' path.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lord of the inferno, your fierce flames burn away all sin..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rock muttered under his breath. As the eerie incantation continued, half his body suddenly withered, becoming skeletal and emaciated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His sunken face showed exhaustion, covered in intricate black patterns that spread like a spiderweb across his skin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dark energy gathered around the Ancient Grimoire, ready to burst forth at any moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Rock continued his chant, his withered body shrank even further.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A black flame the size of a fist emerged from the grimoire, splitting into five sparks that shot into the bodies of the attackers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"BOOM!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Black flames engulfed the five attackers, transforming them into something even more terrifying and grotesque.</span></p><div class="pagination">
