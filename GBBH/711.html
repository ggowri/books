  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The seafood and barbecue are tasty and very fresh. Eat some."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander, Rosalia, and Charlize started eating the barbecue buffet. The freshly caught seafood was indeed delicious, completely different from the one shipped inland frozen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even the air-freighted seafood served to the wealthy in the interior was far inferior to that caught locally.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander, Rosalia, and Charlize ate with relish and laughed happily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The leaders of the forces around them felt uneasy and constantly glanced at Alexander, wondering why he was holding this party.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But they didn't dare to gaze at him for too long. They just caught a glimpse of him and then quickly looked away for fear of attracting his attention.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, he heard all their whispers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He is young, decisive, and promising... With such a hero to lead us on Treasure Island, our future is bright."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, it will be good for our business after the laws and regulations are unified across the island."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smiled slightly, for the vast majority supported him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"From now on, this guy will dominate Treasure Island. I didn't expect Felix to be so disappointing. Back then, I formed an alliance with the Red Umbrella Group, believing that after Felix won, I would be able to take advantage of him. What a surprise!" a corpulent man in his forties muttered indignantly, and his lustful eyes </span><span>roamed incessantly over the plump bodies of Rosalia and Charlize.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He is not that powerful. He is lucky to be Godfather's illegitimate child. If I were him, I would definitely be more successful than him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fuck! Those two women are pretty. If they were my women, I wouldn't let them eat barbecue but eat my..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The corpulent man kept swearing with an obscene smile on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Keep your voice down. Are you seeking death?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's right. If anyone hears you, you're doomed!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The people around tried to dissuade the corpulent man, and some even stayed away from him, fearing that they might get implicated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He growled in disdain, "What are you afraid of? Take it easy. I'm so far away from them. How could he hear me? What cowards! Ouch!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before finishing his words, the corpulent man covered his bloody mouth and collapsed heavily to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A long fishbone stuck in his mouth and even broke his two front teeth, and blood gushed out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After coming back to his senses, he started shouting wildly, "Ouch! Fuck you! Who! Who attacked me? If you have the guts, stand up. Don't hide. I will kill you..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The people around him stepped back one after another, glaring at him with displeasure and wondering if he were mad to dare to act recklessly here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The corpulent man didn't take it seriously and scolded, "Why are you running away? What are you afraid of?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, he saw Alexander appear in front of him and met his icy gaze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The corpulent man shivered and narrowed his eyes in fright.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He swallowed hard and said tremblingly, "W-Was it you who hit me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The cold, murderous intent emanating from Alexander had already made the corpulent man sweat profusely, and his entire body was drenched in cold sweat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I-I didn't say anything. It's a misunderstanding. It's really a misunderstanding..." the corpulent man explained in a panic, not daring to look at Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Will you commit suicide, or should I have you thrown into the sea to feed the sharks?" Alexander asked coldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was just wondering how to establish his authority. To his surprise, this idiot came to his doorstep. He absolutely could not let him off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His punishment should be a warning to others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The corpulent man, who had been extremely arrogant just now, suddenly begged Alexander for mercy desperately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm sorry! It's all my fault. Don't kill me! I was wrong. I'm evil and blind. I'm a bastard..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander said in a very calm tone, "If you commit suicide now, your whole family will survive. They can leave Treasure Island with some of their property and live a peaceful life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you want me to ask someone to take your life, your whole family will die. What are you going to choose?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone trembled with fear and turned pale.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At the same time, Rosalia slowly drew out the katana.</span></p><div class="pagination">
