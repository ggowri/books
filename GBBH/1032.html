  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The remaining ninety-nine percent of the Force was trapped inside Skyla's body, with no outlet to release, and Skyla couldn't absorb it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shit! It hurts!" Skyla screamed in agony as her already plump and full body swelled like a balloon, becoming even more bloated and enlarged.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Save me! It hurts so much..." The poor Skyla cried out in pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her body felt like it was about to explode, with intense pain sweeping through her entire being.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aunt, what... What's wrong with you?" Arlene's face turned pale with fear, but she didn't dare to approach.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone watched as Skyla transformed into a fat person in a short time, and the process continued.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone had seen a balloon burst from overinflation. They knew that if Skyla continued like this, death would be her only fate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah!" Skyla suddenly let out a blood-curdling scream as several fist-sized holes burst open on her body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her body deflated like a punctured balloon, collapsing to the ground, with blood gushing out like a fountain. She eventually became a broken corpse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone present was dumbfounded, thinking, "Skyla died so strangely."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Arlene, who was closer, was splattered with blood all over her body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She stared blankly at Skyla's corpse, unable to understand why Skyla had died so suddenly and strangely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander coldly addressed Arlene, "Tell your family head that I am only targeting Felix and Skyla, not the entire Vanderbilt family."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But if you come looking for trouble again, don't blame me for being cruel."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Arlene remained silent, gazing at Alexander as if she had discovered a priceless treasure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The surrounding bigwigs and elites were all dumbfounded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander killed the arrogant and untouchable Skyla in the blink of an eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The shock Alexander brought them was simply too intense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The members of the Vanderbilt family all turned their heads, staring blankly at Arlene, waiting for her command.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Skyla's death, they had completely lost their confidence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Arlene, what should we do?" Someone asked cautiously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's go," Arlene said without hesitation, turning and leaving immediately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What about...that?" One of her subordinates pointed at Skyla's corpse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My aunt must have been poisoned by something very potent. Do you dare to touch it? We would definitely get poisoned, too. Forget about her! Let's go quickly."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Arlene's words scared the others into hurrying away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Over a hundred members of the Vanderbilt family drove off, completely ignoring Skyla's corpse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was the fate of a loser, left with no one to claim the body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne, save me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne, I'll pay any amount if you can cure my illness."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Derek and Fairchild pleaded desperately with Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava snorted coldly, "Don't bother with them. They were on Skyla's side."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander already despised these two idiots, and now he looked down on them even more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get lost. Don't let me see you in Loscity again, or Skyla's fate will be yours."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's cold words made Fairchild and Derek's faces turn pale.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Except for Oscar and Rebecca, Alexander had no patience for anyone else and directly issued an eviction order.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Go back as you all are unwelcome."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Hansen, please help us..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Some still wanted to ask Rebecca for help.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rebecca sneered, "Weren't you siding with the Vanderbilt family just now? So, beg the Vanderbilt family for help."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying that, she and Oscar followed closely behind Alexander into the Brilliant Tower.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fairchild and Derek's faces turned ashen, looking at each other but not daring to say a word.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This challenge ended with the Vanderbilt family's defeat. Skyla's corpse was left abandoned outside, causing the Vanderbilt family to lose face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Many onlookers, though they hadn't seen exactly what happened, boasted about their extensive knowledge by fabricating stories to prove they were present.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As these stories spread, they became increasingly exaggerated. Tales emerged that Alexander was an angel descended from heaven, possessing an immortal body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Vanderbilt family poisoned him and sent over a hundred armed men to attack, yet none could harm Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a mere flick of his finger, his enemies exploded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although the entrance of the Brilliant Tower was crowded with people, only a few dozen was at the center and could witness the event.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once the story spread, the entire Loscity buzzed with talk of Alexander's supernatural abilities.</span></p><div class="pagination">
