  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava kept calm as she made the demand, "Alright, I'll sign. But I have one </span><span>condition&mdash;the moment I put my name on this, you better have Julian show up and clear the Brilliant Group's and magic powder's names!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliot laughed triumphantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry about that. Once you sign, the formula will officially be ours. Of course, we'll clear up any 'misunderstandings.'"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without a second of hesitation, Ava picked up the pen and swiftly signed the asset transfer agreement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But then she glared at Elliot and yelled, "I'm warning you, if you lay a finger on Lily or Ashley, I swear you'll die a miserable death."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliot, still smug from his "victory," laughed even louder with the contract in his hand like a trophy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's go!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He waved his men toward the exit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop! First, you give us Julian."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, Alexander burst through the crowd, standing directly in front of them with his arms outstretched.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No matter how much the crowd surged against him, Alexander didn't budge. Instead, he exerted the slightest bit of force, sending the people around him stumbling backward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The security guards of the Brilliant Group let out a collective sigh of relief. When Alexander showed up, he made them all look small.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliot, furious at being interrupted, glared at Alexander and yelled, "Boy, why aren't you coming over to greet me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's hand flew through the air, delivering a stinging slap that echoed with a sharp crack across Elliot's cheek. With a piercing scream, Elliot reeled from the force before he crumpled to the ground with a thud.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Y-You dare hit me?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ava's already signed the agreement, so according to what you agreed on, the formula belongs to us now. Hand it over, or you'll owe us 100 billion dollars!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliot waved the contract in Alexander's face, thinking it gave him the upper hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander laughed mockingly. In the blink of an eye, he snatched the contract from Elliot's hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thick document exploded into thousands of pieces of paper, raining down on Elliot and the floor around him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliot's face went slack with shock. He thrust an accusatory finger towards Alexander and muttered, "You bastard! You tore up the agreement in public? How could you! Ah!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before he could finish his rant, Alexander stomped on his chest, pressing him into the ground. His sneer was ice-cold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I let Ava sign that agreement on purpose to humor you. I wanted you to think you'd won before I take everything from you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's smile was wide and almost friendly, but to Elliot, it looked demonic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You! You piece of trash! Aren't you afraid of what might happen to your daughter and Lily?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliot tried the same old trick he'd used on Ava, hoping the threat would work on Alexander, too.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's grip tightened around Elliot's collar, yanking him off the ground. Two hard slaps echoed through the room, leaving Elliot screaming in pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Uncle Elliot, you used a recording of my daughter crying from kindergarten to try and scare me? Who do you think you're messing with? Isn't that a little low, even for you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How did you know about that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliot's eyes widened in confusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, one of the black-clad thugs behind him shouted, "Everyone! That's Alexander! He's the one who used the magic powder to harm us! Grab him! Make him pay compensation!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, the crowd surged forward and whipped into a frenzy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't let him get away! Grab him! Make him pay! If he doesn't cough up the money, we'll tear this shady company to the ground!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah! Smash it all!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The companions at Elliot's side leaped into action and corralled the instigators, steering the group toward the inner sanctum of the company.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were tall, burly, and had a murderous look in their eyes. Anyone with half a brain could see they were spoiling for a fight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Alexander just sneered. These guys were obviously from the Vance family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bang!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander flung out a powerful palm strike, hitting one of the biggest thugs </span><span>square</span><span> in the chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The massive man flew backward, sailing over the heads of the crowd until he smashed into the wall. The impact was so strong that he stuck to the wall for a moment before slumping to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before the other thugs could react, Alexander slapped them away one by one, sending them crashing into the crowd like they were nothing more than ragdolls.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Within seconds, the floor was littered with bodies, and the surge of attackers was brought to a grinding halt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The last remaining thug, a tall figure in black, stood frozen in place. As soon as Alexander's gaze landed on him, the man turned on his heel and tried to make a run for it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Alexander was faster. He grabbed the man by the neck and yanked him off his feet, holding him in the air like he weighed nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Julian," Alexander growled, "you really thought you could run?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With one swift motion, Alexander tore off the man's face, literally peeling away a thin, translucent face mask.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gasps erupted all around. Ava and the others from the Brilliant Group stood stunned, their mouths hanging open in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Underneath the mask was none other than Julian, the warehouse supervisor who had gone missing!</span></p><div class="pagination">
