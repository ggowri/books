  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the birch forest on the mountain outside Dominion Church, Alexander was honing his martial arts skills alongside Vegeta and Nova.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With an iron rod in hand, Alexander swung it fiercely against the wind. Suddenly, the shadows of the rod filled the sky, accompanied by the rumble of thunder and the rush of air, striking down towards Vegeta's head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vegeta's expression turned serious as he deftly leaped away, moving quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Nova let out a roar, his frame towering as he seemed to swell even larger. Stomping his feet, he launched himself toward Alexander's back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a quick shout, Alexander jumped and twisted in the air like an agile priestey, the iron rod whizzing through the air as it swept towards Nova's left foot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vegeta soared high, his arms and fists flying as he rushed at Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a sharp roar, Alexander staggered as if intoxicated, his stick shadows continuing to dance around him. He struck left and right, enveloping both Vegeta and Nova in a barrage of relentless strikes, leaving them flustered and unable to defend themselves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Two hours later, the three of them took a break in the forest, sipping some water.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vegeta sighed inwardly; despite Alexander being a level-three warrior, his stick techniques were incredibly powerful, and he and Nova had only managed to hold their ground against him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was also good to his people, ensuring that the elderly and children didn't have to labor and had no worries about their lives.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, aside from gratitude, Vegeta was determined to surpass everyone one day.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Noticing the fighting spirit in Vegeta's eyes, Alexander understood that he was unwilling to accept defeat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He pondered how he could use Vegeta's ambition to improve his own skills.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Vegeta, Nova, can I count on you?" Alexander asked, fixing his gaze on them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nova jumped up, exclaiming, "Mr. Hawthorne, I'm willing to do anything for you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vegeta bowed solemnly, saying, "Mr. Hawthorne, you've treated my people with great kindness. Anyone who wishes you harm will have to take me down first."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander helped Vegeta up and replied, "I have an energy technique; it should suit you well!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vegeta and Nova exchanged surprised glances.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They understood that obtaining any martial arts knowledge on Noah Continent or Sahasia was incredibly difficult.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If their tribe had access to such techniques, they wouldn't have been overrun by the Noah Empire so swiftly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had heard from Logan that Alexander was a martial arts genius from Dominion Church in Sahasia, so they bowed deeply to him in respect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vegeta's fighting spirit surged. He felt he finally had a technique to master. Stealing a glance at Alexander, he was filled with anticipation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Two months flew by in the blink of an eye, and it was already New Year's Eve. Heavy snow had been falling for days, blanketing Darwin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the birch forest outside Dominion Church, Alexander, Vegeta, and Nova were meditating and training in the snow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, Vegeta felt inexplicably joyful, causing him to open his eyes in surprise. He saw Nova smiling, which puzzled him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander stood up, laughing, "I've finally mastered the Golden Body!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vegeta and Nova cheered, "Congratulations, Mr. Hawthorne!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's hand resembled an eagle's claw as he tightly grasped his own arm and shook it, leaving faint white marks behind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His muscles and bones felt as strong as fine steel, impervious to ordinary weapons. He wondered how he compared to a level-four warrior.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though he wasn't sure how to reach fourth-level status, he felt more confident about winning the outer courtyard competition now that he had achieved the Golden Body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Determined, Alexander decided to practice sensing the fighting aura using his technique.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He closed his eyes, focused, and took in his surroundings. Suddenly, he coughed up a mouthful of blood and collapsed to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vegeta and Nova rushed to his side, their anxiety mounting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's okay!" Alexander reassured them slowly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, his heart raced like a whirlwind, filled with fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Within Dominion Church, an overwhelming array of powerful auras surrounded him. It was so potent it felt boundless; Alexander felt powerless in the presence of them. Just sensing the aura had caused him harm!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Unbeknownst to him, at that moment within Dominion Church, the 18 masters of the Hina Sect, Father Ahmed, Father Lincoln, Father Musa, and Father Jamison&mdash;glanced toward the woods where Alexander was training.</span></p><div class="pagination">
