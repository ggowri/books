  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander reached out towards the Lightsabers, and they flew back, violently piercing the body of the man in black, pinning him to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Lightsabers emitted a soft glow</span><span> </span><span>which</span><span>mixed</span><span> with the orange flames of the bonfire, illuminating the dark cave as if it were daytime.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man in black coughed up blood, grinning savagely. "Alexander, you forced me. You and this bitch are both doomed."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He pulled out a vial of red liquid and injected it into his body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, the man in black let out a beast-like roar. His body swelled up, breaking free from the Lightsabers. He paid no attention to the fact that the Lightsabers had severed one-third of his body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His arms became as thick as a fitness champion's thighs, and he quickly grew taller, reaching at least 8 feet, his body turning completely black.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes resembled crystal balls, wide open and bloodshot, completely devoid of any trace of humanity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dead Regeneration," Alexander muttered, watching the changes in the man in black with indifference.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew that the enhancement drugs from the Sakra Society had made progress. The form of the man in black was an advanced version of the living dead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This type of creature not only possesses the living dead's characteristic of being immune to harm but also has low-level intelligence."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shit. You'll die!" The man in black pointed at Alexander with fingers as sharp as needles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lynn had already fainted in fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander felt a surge of fighting spirit. He wanted to test how powerful this advanced version of the living dead could be.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He kicked at the broken blade on the ground, which was enveloped by the Force, shooting towards the man in black's head like lightning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The vital point of the living dead is only the head. As long as their heads are severed, they truly become dead."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The broken blade flew at high speed, but the man in black quickly raised his arm to block his head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The broken blade struck deep into the man in black's arm but was blocked by the mutated bone, producing a crisp clang of metal against metal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander couldn't help but be astonished, thinking, "The advanced living dead are indeed much stronger. Their bones are comparable to steel. Otherwise, my strike would have at least severed one of his arms."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man in black roared in anger and lunged at Alexander like an enraged bear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He lunged forward with outstretched claws, black blood oozing from his arms and abdomen, resembling a beast from hell.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Alexander reacted quickly. He leaped up behind the man in black and summoned the Lightsabers to his hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Lightsabers flickered and instantly flew towards the man in black's thick neck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No." The man in black sensed danger, but his inflated body couldn't keep up with Alexander's speed. He desperately shrank his head, swinging his arms back to try to block the Lightsabers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, both his arms were severed by the Lightsabers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two arms, as thick as barrels, fell heavily to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Immediately after, before the man in black could turn around, his massive head flew </span><span>into the air, spinning several times before landing, rolling a good distance away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander sneered dismissively, "Aside from having the intelligence of a three-year-old child and slightly stronger resistance, he has no other advantages."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander kicked, and the man in black's head exploded with a loud bang, turning into a heap of meat sauce.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander looked at the headless corpse, which lay on the ground, motionless, truly dead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even the universe has a day of destruction. How could anything achieve immortality? Greedy humans."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander shook his head with a sigh. With a wave of his hand, the flames of the Force Burning wrapped around the remnants and fragments, quickly turning them to ashes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After doing all this, Alexander ran to Lynn's side, tore the ropes binding her, and held her in his arms while channeling the Force into her body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander." After a while, Lynn slowly awakened, still a bit dazed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, I... I'm not dreaming, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smiled and gently touched her luscious chest, comforting her, "You are not dreaming. It's all fine now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Really? What about that monster?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lynn was both surprised and delighted, then looked around in fear, her beautiful eyes filled with terror.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Everything is fine. That guy has already been taken care of by me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander embraced Lynn and kissed her soft cheek.</span></p><div class="pagination">
