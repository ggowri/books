  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander strode forward fearlessly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Two bodyguards rushed to block him, but before they could touch him, they were stopped by an invisible, solid wall of force. They couldn't move.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As they stood there in shock, Alexander struck.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With lightning speed, he landed a right hook on one bodyguard's face, sending him flying.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The second bodyguard didn't even have time to react before Alexander's left uppercut hit his chin, knocking him out cold.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ryan's face turned pale as he quickly drew his gun and pointed it at Alexander.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'll blow your brains out!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He yelled, pulling the trigger hard.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But the gun didn't fire.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ryan and Jane stared at Alexander in disbelief.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Somehow, without them noticing, Alexander had removed the magazine from the gun.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With a swift kick, Alexander sent Ryan flying like a soccer ball.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At the same time, the Force silently flowed into Alexander's legs, cutting off the nerves in Ryan's legs.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jane was frozen in fear, unable to believe what she was seeing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ryan weighed at least 180 pounds, yet Alexander, who seemed tall and slim, had easily overpowered two bodyguards and kicked Ryan like he weighed nothing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She thought, "Alexander had changed so much overnight. What was going on?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jane felt her mind was about to explode.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"This is just the beginning. Get ready to face your fate."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander said coldly, giving her a final glance before turning to leave.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It wasn't until Alexander's figure disappeared around the corner that Jane finally snapped out of her daze, trembling.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The look in Alexander's eyes and his demeanor had been terrifying. She had been paralyzed, unable to move.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Dear, are you okay?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jane stammered as she rushed over to help Ryan.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ryan cursed under his breath, but suddenly, his face twisted in shock and anger as he clutched his legs and shouted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What's happening? My legs are numb. I can't stand... What's going on with my legs...?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jane was stunned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander had said he would cripple Ryan's legs. She had thought he was bluffing, but it turned out to be true.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ryan gritted his teeth and said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Alexander must know some kind of sorcery. He cursed me. There's no other explanation. My legs were fine, and after just one kick, they're useless."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She thought, "Sorcery?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jane's face turned pale as a bitter realization set in.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She had never imagined that Alexander was truly hiding his power.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With such terrifying sorcery, he could easily become a VIP that powerful people would want to befriend.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ryan urgently urged.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Get me to a hospital, now! And call Alexander. Tell him to lift the curse, or else...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"When I become the vice president of the Saint Group, the first thing I'll do is have him killed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Remind him that the Saint Group is backed by the Godfather, known as the Reaper. Killing him would be as easy as squashing a bug!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jane frowned deeply.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Suddenly, she realized how childish Ryan sounded. She thought, "If Alexander had such power, would he really be afraid?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Do I really need to beg Alexander?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jane hesitated, feeling humiliated by the thought.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But after a moment of reflection, Jane knew she had no choice but to find Alexander. Only the person who caused the problem could fix it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Dear, I'll call an ambulance to take you to the hospital first, and then I'll negotiate with Alexander."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Jane, you should sweet-talk him a bit if you need to. As long as he lifts the curse, it's fine. Once I'm the vice president of the Saint Group, I'll have him killed and make sure we'll get rid of him for good!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ryan fumed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Don't worry, dear. Go to the hospital, and I'll deal with Alexander."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jane reluctantly agreed, feeling conflicted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After the ambulance took Ryan away, Jane collapsed into her car seat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She rested for a while before driving back home in a daze.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What's wrong, Jane? You look awful. Where's Ryan?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Andrew asked, puzzled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jane recounted everything that had just happened in detail.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Dad, why has Alexander been hiding his strength? Suddenly, I can't figure him out. And now that Ryan's in the hospital, what should I do?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jane asked, rubbing her temples in frustration.</p><div class="pagination">
