  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane looked at Alexander with a complicated expression.</span><span> </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't get cocky. You haven't faced anyone truly formidable yet. Who have you beaten? Ryan's just a playboy, Joseph's a thug, and the Tate family are drug dealers. That's nothing impressive.</span><span> </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Jacob is a real hero from the battlefield. Your amateur skills are no match for him. Unless you're using some kind of magic... General, this guy might be using magic!" Jane urgently warned Schroder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sorcery? Ha! Jacob, break his arms first. Let's see how he casts spells then," Schroder scoffed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander wasn't interested in fighting Jacob; opponents like him didn't matter anymore.</span><span> </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Augusta stepped forward. "Boss, let me handle him."</span><span> </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll do it!"</span><span> </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, let me!" Marvin and William both volunteered eagerly, while Charlize stayed quiet.</span><span> </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smiled. "William, you go ahead. You both have military backgrounds, so your skills should be similar."</span><span> </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>William grinned and was about to step forward when Alexander stopped him, handing him a vial of red potion. "Drink half of this," he instructed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without hesitation, William drank half the potion. Instantly, he felt a warm surge through his body, invigorating him with newfound strength.</span><span> </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He pounded his chest with excitement. "Don't worry, Boss. I'm confident I can take him down!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was a potential-enhancing potion refined by Alexander using the Force, completely safe and effective.</span><span> </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Schroder was surprised to see the potion but then smirked. He assumed it was foolish to use it now, thinking it had severe side effects that might incapacitate William before the fight even began.</span><span> </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander checked his phone and calmly said, "William, make it quick. You have three minutes."</span><span> </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, Boss. He'll be done in three minutes," William promised.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feeling the mysterious energy surging inside, William strode toward Jacob, eager to unleash his newfound strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jacob laughed at their exchange. "I've been all over </span><span>Tanaxes</span><span>, killed hundreds, maybe thousands, and I've never seen arrogance like yours. William, is it? You should bring backup, or you won't stand a chance."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>William squinted at Jacob, replying coldly, "You think you're a big deal? I'll finish you in one minute!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jacob laughed loudly. "You're delusional. Finish me in a minute? You're a fool. I'll take you out first, then deal with Alexander."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>William's eyes burned with anger. "Insult me all you want, but don't disrespect my boss. You'll regret it!"</span><span> </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jacob dismissed him with a scoff, not taking William seriously.</span><span> </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kneel and apologize to my boss!" William charged at Jacob like a force of nature.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The rushing wind hit Jacob's face, carrying a murderous aura so intense it felt almost tangible. Jacob's expression shifted; this guy was serious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jacob dodged swiftly, swinging a fist at William's face. The punch was lightning-fast, aimed to break William's jaw.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before the potion, William would never have dodged such a punch. But now, he felt the warm energy burst, allowing him to twist his body at an impossible angle, just avoiding the blow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they passed each other, William landed a heavy chop on Jacob's neck.</span><span> </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Puff!" Jacob spat out a mouthful of blood.</span></p><div class="pagination">
