It might be a bit too late for that!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander looked down at Frederick with a cold, detached gaze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Frederick's heart had been pierced, yet he clung to life, his formidable strength keeping him alive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unless Alexander chose to heal him, which was unlikely, Frederick's chances of survival were slim.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill them all! Leave no one standing!" Alexander commanded with a wave of his hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A wicked grin spread across Augusta's face as he relayed Alexander's orders through his communicator.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sound of gunfire echoed ominously, each shot marking the end of another Morris family member, their lives snuffed out in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Augusta was relentless, swinging his machete as he pursued the remaining Morris family members with fierce determination.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Alexander prowled the estate, searching for any sign of Felix.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Felix really took off, and he's quick about it," Alexander muttered to himself, noticing the absence of Felix's presence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was clear he had made a hasty retreat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Boss, we couldn't find Felix. What's the plan now?" Augusta asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calm and collected, Alexander analyzed the situation. "Hmph, he's nothing but a stray dog now. The news of the Morris family's downfall will spread like wildfire&mdash;no one will dare ally with him again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The military won't risk a conflict with me just to back him up. Felix is smart enough not to return to the Red Umbrella Group to wait for death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He'll head to Treasure Island, trying to recruit the Brilliant Group to bolster his strength since he doesn't know Cloe is under my wings."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander declared, striding away with Augusta in tow, "Let's move out and wait for Felix to walk right into our trap."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Behind them, the grand Morris Estate erupted in flames, the inferno painting the sky a vivid crimson.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet not a single Morris family member fled the scene; their bodies lay strewn about, lifeless and still.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For the foreseeable future, Felix would keep his head down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander decided to return to Loscity with his daughter, while Augusta would lead a team back to Treasure Island to strengthen their defenses and bide their time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Alexander's figure faded into the horizon, a figure darted into the burning Morris Estate&mdash;it was Felix.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The mansion was engulfed in flames, and the sight of over a hundred fallen Morris family members was gruesome.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even the cold-hearted Felix felt a chill run down his spine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Frederick Morris, how are you holding up?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix finally found Frederick sprawled on the ground, fortunate to have collapsed in an open area, or he would have been consumed by the flames by now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Frederick trembled as he raised his head, his face ashen and devoid of color.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's me, it's me! Are you alright?" Felix called out, scanning Frederick's injuries to assess their severity and determine if Frederick could still fight back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Felix, is that you!?" Frederick exclaimed, a rush of relief flooding him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hadn't expected Felix to risk everything to save him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Felix... you have to help me... please, stop the bleeding. I can only hold on for a little while longer. If you don't come, I'm done for..." Frederick pleaded desperately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix narrowed his eyes, a menacing glint flickering within.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Frederick Morris, are you really that badly hurt?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He focused intently on Frederick, his right hand slowly gripping the syringe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Frederick gasped for air, clutching Felix's arm tightly. "Felix, save me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, I'll save you!!!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix's cheerful demeanor shifted in an instant. With a sudden, swift motion, he plunged the syringe deep into Frederick's chest, injecting the crimson serum directly into his body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two were so close, and Felix moved like lightning. Frederick, gravely injured and on the brink of death, had no strength left to resist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah! Felix, what are you doing?" Frederick gasped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was horrified as he watched the eerie </span><span>red light</span><span> flicker from his chest, a horrific gaping hole melting through him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You bastard, are you trying to kill me?" Frederick roared, summoning the last of his strength to claw at Felix's throat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You old fool, you still want to fight back?" Felix chuckled, twisting Frederick's arm until a sickening crack echoed in the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Frederick's right arm snapped like a twig.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he attempted to retaliate, he found himself utterly drained of energy, trembling and convulsing, his chest cavity already ravaged by the serum.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Frederick, consider yourself lucky&mdash;you get to be my stepping stone to greater power! Don't worry, I'll make sure to avenge the Morris family by taking down Alexander!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix gloated, looking down at Frederick with a sneer of triumph.</span></p><div class="pagination">
