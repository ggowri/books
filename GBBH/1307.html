Their true purpose was to cultivate a powerful body. When the body reached its peak&mdash;becoming a Level-Five Warrior, achieving the Diamond Body&mdash;one could then pursue the righteous path and transcend life and death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though this was the pinnacle of Sahasia martial arts, other continents had their own Level-Five Warriors. For example, the Noah Empire had its Holy Knights.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the end of the fist manual, there was a line: [Train diligently, and you shall break free from the cycle of life and death.]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander set the manual down, lost in thought. "It's clear now," he mused. "The Dominion Church didn't just give the residents and workers Energy-Gathering Techniques and fist manuals so they could catch thieves or grow crops. There's more to it than that."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In this world, strength ruled. If he wanted to survive, he needed power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mastering martial arts meant he had two options: entering the Outer Court or joining the military. Both were far better than farming.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For the past two months, every time he meditated, the golden figure in his chest would appear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Golden energy would spread warmth through his body, merging with the Force as it flowed into his martial core. Now, the cluster of Force within his core had grown to the size of a soybean. The Force coursing through his body had thickened considerably. It was no longer as thin as a needle tip.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By now, he had fully mastered the moves of Arhat Fist. Lately, whenever he practiced, he felt an overwhelming surge of power, as if his muscles were swelling, ready to burst with unstoppable strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander stroked his chin, deep in thought. Then he called Logan over to an empty clearing to practice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He himself picked another open space, settling into an Arhat Fist stance. His feet shoulder-width apart, elbows tucked in, palms pressing downward as he focused his breath into his martial core. His steps followed his punches, movements swift and sharp.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One by one, he executed each technique. As he practiced, he could faintly hear the sound of wind and thunder. Before he knew it, he had completed all 108 forms of Arhat Fist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A rush of exhilaration coursed through him. His muscles suddenly tensed and expanded. A surge of Force shot up from his martial core, racing along his spine to the top of his head, sending a wave of pleasure through him. The Force roared within him, his coarse robe fluttering as his bones crackled like firecrackers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've reached Level-One Warrior!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander clenched his fists, his heart pounding with excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hadn't expected that in less than two months of training, he would already break into Level-One Warrior&mdash;officially stepping into the world of martial artists.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The manual had been clear: the signs of reaching Level-One Warrior were the Force lifting one's clothing, muscles bulging, and bones producing an audible crackle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The strongest prodigies of Sahasia took two years to reach this level. Those with dull talent would never achieve it in their lifetime.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander had done it ten times faster than a top genius. He knew this was thanks to the golden energy in his chest and the mysterious Force, but he still had no idea where this golden energy came from.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Could I be a genius among geniuses? Was I born for martial arts?" The thought filled him with pride.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He decided not to tell Logan just yet. He wanted to give him a good scare when the time was right.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Glancing at the sun, he called out, "Logan, time's up. Let's get back to the melon fields!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright! Huh? Alexander, your eyes look... different. They're sharper than before."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Logan followed Alexander toward the fields.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment they arrived, Logan let out a horrified yell. "Someone messed with our crops!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their two emerald melon fields were in utter ruin as if a tornado had swept through.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Several melon plants had been uprooted. The remaining ones were stripped bare, their vines broken and scattered. The once-thriving Verdant Crown Melons were riddled with gaping holes. Every single melon had withered, clearly punctured by some kind of metal tool.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's face darkened. His fists clenched.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Cleveland and Rory... It has to be them!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Logan looked devastated. "Alexander, there's only a little over a month left before the harvest. We each have to turn in at least five hundred pounds of melons. We're screwed."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't panic. Let me think." Alexander sat on the field ridge, his expression grave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If they failed to deliver the required amount, the Inspection Office would kick them out of the church. Without their status as church workers, they might even be sent to the police... If they had no other options, their only hope would be to plead with the Head Priest Hezekiah. That might be their only way out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander made up his mind. If they were truly about to be thrown out, he wouldn't go quietly. He would cause a scene. After all, begging the Head Priest Hezekiah was still better than ending up in the hands of the police.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Logan, don't be afraid. We've got someone powerful on our side. We know the Head Priest Hezekiah. I'll ask for his help when the time comes."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He comforted Logan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Logan's eyes lit up. "That's right! I totally forgot about him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His spirits lifted at once.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Alexander wasn't as optimistic. "Meeting the Head Priest Hezekiah is easier said than done."</span></p><div class="pagination">
