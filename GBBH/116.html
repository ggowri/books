  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Oscar tucked the check away with a pleased smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're a sly one, aren't you? Don't worry; I'll keep my mouth shut."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Alexander was about to leave, he noticed that Felicity was still in the hall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Felicity, didn't I ask Sir Stewart to send someone to take you home?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you, Alexander, but I don't want to go back. I'd rather find a place to stay for now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She looked at him with a hopeful expression. It looked like she was waiting for an invitation to his place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander could only force a bitter smile, pretending he hadn't caught her hint.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Not going home might be for the best. It'll save you from their pressure. Sir Stewart, Felicity just graduated </span><span>from </span><span>college and hasn't found a job yet. Could I trouble you to help her find a job and a place to stay?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Oscar readily agreed. To him, this was a trivial matter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After learning that Alexander might control the magic powder, Oscar had grown even more respectful of him and was eager to keep their relationship in good standing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felicity looked disappointed. She watched Alexander leave, lingering as if she wanted to say something, but no words came out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before he got into his car, Alexander waved goodbye to her. Soon, his old Toyota vanished into the busy traffic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking of her family's </span><span>selfishness</span><span> and Alexander's selfless help, Felicity couldn't stop the tears from streaming down her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lara<span>, who had been waiting for quite some time, immediately started her car and began following.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, I'll see just what you're up to!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander quickly noticed the car tailing him and pressed down on the accelerator.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His car shot into the opposite lane, darted through an intersection, and sped away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lara</span><span> was</span><span> caught off guard, nearly </span><span>ran</span><span> </span><span>into</span><span> another car. She pulled over quickly, her </span><span>face pale with fear as she steadied herself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, you bastard! I'll expose whatever scheme you and Oscar are plotting!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Jane entered the hospital room with a song on her lips, swaying her hips confidently. Her alluring figure drew many admiring glances as she walked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She handed a document to Sebastian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Tate, great news! Mr. Gellar has agreed to grant Brilliant Group </span><span>as the major</span><span> distribut</span><span>or of</span><span> the magic powder!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian's face lit up with delight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah, Jane, you're incredible. It's a privilege to have someone as capable as you on the team. Once the conference is over, you'll be our new vice president."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane's face turned red with excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, Andrew grinned obsequiously and said, "Mr. Tate, we advanced forty million dollars as a </span><span>deposit</span><span> for Mr. Gellar. Could we get that</span><span> </span><span>back?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian's face darkened, and he said tersely, "What? Coming to me </span><span>just for </span><span>forty million? Isn't it clearly laid out in the contract?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"When Mr. Gellar's partnership with us is </span><span>sealed</span><span>, we'll give him a billion dollars. Have him pay you back then."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Andrew was left speechless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Annoyed, Jane chided, "Dad, how could you bring up the forty million dollars in front of Mr. Tate? Don't you have any sense of the bigger picture?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Andrew shot her a glare but kept silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian waved them off. "You've both worked hard; go take a rest."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though they wanted to stay and curry more favor with Sebastian, his dismissal left Andrew and Jane with no choice but to leave, looking rather deflated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Once I officially become </span><span>the </span><span>vice president, I'll make Alexander come begging. Let's see who dares to cross me then!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane gritted her teeth, her eyes filled with a fierce hatred toward Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the hospital room, Sebastian kept looking over the contract, growing more pleased with each glance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Evan, tomorrow when we meet that Jackson guy, we need to find a way to capture him. We must </span><span>take over</span><span> the formula for the magic powder."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan's face was lit with excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dad, once we control the magic powder, every faction, the Blood Gang, the Cripples, the Kaylon, and the four major families in </span><span>Loscity</span><span>, will all be lining up to work with us."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We'll destroy the Saint Group and take Alexander out!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course. And it's all thanks to that foolish Jane. She still dreams of marrying into our family. She's deluded."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"When we </span><span>merge</span><span> the Saint Group</span><span> into us</span><span> and kill Alexander, your uncle will be the next Godfather!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"By then, we'll be the most powerful force of all!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Filled with visions of their bright future, Sebastian and Evan laughed with anticipation.</span></p><div class="pagination">
