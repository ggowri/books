  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Emma got anxious, not knowing what to do.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Maxine knelt to Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Alex, please save my dad again! I know you can save him. I'm willing to do anything to repay you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander helped her up. "Don't worry. I will take care of this to the end."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Thank you..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Emma and Maxine looked gratefully at Alexander with tearful eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alvin shouted like crazy, "Kill me now! I feel so miserable. Please kill me. I can never escape Jordan's control in my life..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander held him down and worked up the Force Sense, examining Alvin's internal condition.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As the Force was input into Alvin's body, the effect of the potion in Alvin's body was suppressed, and he felt much better.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This gave Alvin a glimmer of hope in his despair. Maybe this young man could help him again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He gave a self-mocking smile at the thought. The mind-controlling potion was invented by the top-notch biochemical experts hired by Silver Shield Security. No one could remove it from his body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With the Force and X-ray vision, Alexander could see what was going on inside Alvin's body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The position of his pineal gland in his brain stem was abnormal. The mind-controlling potion was indeed very powerful. It couldn't be removed by the Force alone. Some herbs would be needed for the treatment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Among the Ultimate Legacy, there was a prescription left by a wizard. It was created to detoxify and was suitable for the current situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alvin could be cured with the Force and the herbs mentioned by the prescription.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing that Alexander had been silent, Alvin forced a smile and said, "Mr. Hawthorne, it's okay if you don't have a solution. Don't press yourself. I'm willing to give you all the technical information about the All-purpose Bullet-resistant Jacket. Please shoot me to free me of the pain...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I hope you can take good care of my wife and daughter. I won't have any regrets in my life."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander said calmly, "I can help you get rid of the potion, but I need to find some herbs, which takes time."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Really? I heard that Jordan and the others could do nothing about it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alvin was stunned. He couldn't believe it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Dad, when Alex says he can do it, and he will do it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Maxine became excited.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Emma wore a complicated expression. When her husband asked Alexander to take good care of her and her daughter, she felt inexplicably delighted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, she still hoped that Alvin could be cured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I can't lose a moment. I will go to the nearby mountains to look for the herbs. I hope I can find those I need," Alexander said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Emma quickly said, "I am familiar with the surrounding mountains. I will be your guide and go with you. Maxine, take good care of your father."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Maxine was not suspicious and agreed readily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander glanced at Emma and refused with mixed feelings, "No, thank you. I can go by myself."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Emma turned pale immediately. Before she could speak, Maxine quickly persuaded Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"No, Alex. You are helping my dad, so let my mom take you there. My grandpa's farm is at the foot of the mountain, and my mom is familiar with the mountains, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Emma nodded vigorously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne, please let my wife go with you. She can help you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alvin also agreed with this plan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander sighed secretly and couldn't bring himself to say anything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He could imagine that Emma would try to seduce him given such a good opportunity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Then we will set off now and come back as soon as possible."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander finally agreed and made preparations.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If Emma seduced him again, and he lost control, he shouldn't be blamed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander and Emma left the hotel together. Under Emma's guidance, he drove to the foot of a mountain far away from the city.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The terrain here was dangerous with high mountains and dense forests.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Emma pointed to the peak and said, "This is the highest mountain in the neighborhood Apart from adventurers, few people come here. I heard there were leopards, wild wolves, and bears in the mountains. We have to be careful."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander nodded. The mountain peak, which stood at an elevation of over half a mile, was shrouded in clouds and mist, looking majestic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"With me around, you don't have to worry about the wild animals. If they dare to come out, I will barbecue them."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Emma couldn't help laughing out loud and then pinched Alexander's arm.</span></p><div class="pagination">
