  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I thought I would never see you and Ava again."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lynn held Alexander tightly, feeling very safe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What do we do now? Do you think they have any accomplices left?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I took care of his accomplices as well. Let's go home."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander carried Lynn horizontally as he walked out of the cave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you." Lynn's eyes were filled with tears. She wrapped her arms around Alexander's neck, gently leaning against his chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's left hand was supporting Lynn's thigh, with his arm pressed against her plump hips. Alexander put his right arm around her waist, his palm on her plump peak, and it felt wonderful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander couldn't help but swallow his saliva, and he had a reaction in his crotch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it weren't for the few people who had just died here, Alexander would have planned to have exciting sex with Lynn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Forest Park at midnight was terrifyingly quiet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lynn only felt safe in Alexander's arms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Alexander was holding Lynn in his arms, he walked very fast.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, I really don't know what to do without you today."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lynn couldn't help but feel emotional, pressing her cheek against Alexander's chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She dressed very sexy today, with clothes made of silk material, thin and smooth. The fabric wrapped around her plump body like an intoxicating peach.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Most of the buttons on Lynn's clothes had already come undone, and her plump breasts kept trembling with Alexander's footsteps.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One of them was even covered by Alexander's right palm, with its pink nipple pinched between his two fingers, making Lynn feel numb and powerless all over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander emitted a strong masculine aura, making Lynn uncontrollably feel the dampness between her legs, and a captivating blush spread across her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander found that there was a fire burning in his lower abdomen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lynn wrapped her arms around Alexander's neck and looked at him affectionately, saying, "Alexander, if you hadn't found me, I would have killed myself. I will never let them get close to me. My body belongs only to you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander couldn't help but be moved, feeling warm in his heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing that Alexander didn't respond, Lynn thought he didn't believe her, and her expression became desolate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, don't you believe me? I'm serious. If anyone wants to rape me, I will definitely kill myself."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander quickly comforted her, "Don't say silly things. I will definitely save you. Even if you have an accident, don't hurt yourself because you have to be with me and Ava forever."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's words moved Lynn to tears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, thank you. Thank you for accepting me and Ava."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lynn murmured, holding Alexander's neck tighter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the depths of their love, Alexander was also finding it hard to hold back, but they were about to reach the parking spot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He pinched Lynn's plump chest and whispered in her ear, "The car is parked up ahead. Wait a little longer."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lynn naturally understood what Alexander meant and blushed, nodding her head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, Alexander found his car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get in the car." Alexander opened the car door and put Lynn down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lynn's silk blouse was wide open, and her pencil skirt had slid up to her buttocks, revealing her slender and smooth thighs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander couldn't help but be attracted to her round and full body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lynn saw Alexander staring blankly at her, blushing and shyly climbed into the car. She even deliberately raised her perky buttocks and wiggled them in front of Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander slapped Lynn's buttocks with his hand. The soft flesh of her hips quivered, tantalizing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Umm..." Lynn's face turned red all the way to her ears. It felt like ten thousand little deer were bumping around in her heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Lynn had had sex with Alexander many times before, she still felt shy whenever she thought about the relationship between her daughter and Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander hugged her from behind, grasping her bouncing breasts with his hands in front.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lynn turned her head, closed her eyes, and offered her soft, moist lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While kissing Lynn, Alexander supported her waist with both hands, allowing her to </span><span>kneel and lean on the car seat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lynn felt like Alexander had stripped her naked, and she exclaimed in surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander carefully admired the perfect body, making it mouthwatering.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, come on! I can't wait."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lynn spoke in a coquettish tone, swaying her plump body to seduce Alexander.</span></p><div class="pagination">
