Jaxon howled in </span><span>agony,</span><span> his arms twisted in unnatural angles as Alexander wrenched them apart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The hidden mechanism in his sleeve, which had been firing the poison needles, was destroyed in one swift motion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dozens of poisoned needles buried themselves in Jaxon's arms, causing excruciating pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Jaxon fumbled for the antidote, Alexander grinned coldly, a flick of his wrist sending the vial crashing to the ground, shattering it into pieces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hundreds of black pills scattered across the floor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, you're a monster!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jaxon snarled, his head spinning, darkness clouding his vision.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He tried to grab the antidote from the floor, but it was as if his body was made of lead, collapsing like a fallen tree.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander stood over him, watching impassively as he convulsed on the ground, foaming at the mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cynthia's face turned ashen, her hand still clutching the detonator, trembling violently as she screamed at Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Give him the antidote! Now, or I'll blow everything up! The whole Island will go up in flames!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander glanced at her coldly, and before she could react, he moved.

"Take them both away. Don't let them die. Interrogate them thoroughly."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The others snapped out of their stupor, rushing over to drag the two of them out of the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander grabbed the detonator from Cloe's hand, his face dark.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Ghost, huh? You really want to cross me? Fine, don't say I didn't warn you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The threats from the Mafia and Sakra Society were still looming, and with Yinson ready to trigger a global crisis at any moment, Alexander couldn't afford to relax.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, with the even more dangerous Ghost involved, he needed to be on high alert.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He ordered Cloe to organize an emergency meeting to speed up the defense construction on Treasure and Devil Island.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Top members of the Brilliant Group, including Shadow, William, and Marvin, were all called in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next morning, Alexander hurried back to </span><span>Loscity</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By then, Cloe, who had been working all night, was lying in bed, sound asleep, her body still bearing the marks of his affection.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Norma had already delivered several hundred pounds of iridium to </span><span>Loscity</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Along with the new batch of rare gems that Alyssa and Beverly had collected, Alexander's first priority was to upgrade the Lightsabers from Level 2 to Level 3.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Power was the foundation of his strength. Only with that could he protect his loved ones.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander didn't care about being a hero, but he couldn't stand the thought of losing the people closest to him, especially not his daughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Ashley had been admitted to the ICU, he had sworn to never let anything hurt her again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander walked into the villa in </span><span>Loscity</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're finally home..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava rushed into his arms, her emotions spilling over.
