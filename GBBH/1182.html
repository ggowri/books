  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>William was furious. "What do you mean? You want my boss to cook for you? You must be out of your mind."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Logan slammed his gun on the table, glaring fiercely at Dulles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cloe softly said, "Boss, don't pay him any mind. He's just trying to provoke you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smiled slightly and calmly replied, "If what I make tastes better than yours, will you admit I was right and then apologize?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander looked at Dulles with deep-set eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sure," Dulles agreed immediately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If what you make is better than mine, I will certainly apologize and give you a prestigious membership card for free meals for life."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But what if you lose?" Dulles countered with a sly glint in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're asking for trouble," Cloe replied angrily, feeling that Dulles was foolish to disrespect Alexander on Treasure Island.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander held Cloe back and said, "If I lose, I'll give you one million dollars."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dulles' eyes brightened, and he quickly said, "It's a deal, Mr. Hawthorne. I'll take you to the kitchen. Let's get started now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander maintained a calm expression, unfazed, as he followed Dulles into the back room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>William panicked. "Boss, you fell for his provocation."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Logan sneered, "Regardless of whether we win or lose, I am going to feed that guy to sharks."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The manager and restaurant staff scoffed, all thinking Alexander would lose.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, he was just an unknown, ordinary person who dared to claim that his cooking was better than that of a royal chef's descendant. It was simply ridiculous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cloe suggested, "Let's back boss up."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The group was curious and quickly followed them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The kitchen was very large, and several chefs and assistants were busy working. When they saw Dulles bring Alexander in, they looked at him with puzzled expressions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dulles grinned and explained the bet he made with Alexander. The chefs laughed openly, casting scornful looks at Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne, you better keep your word. If you lose, you owe me one million dollars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you back out or try to deal with me, the reputation you've built on Treasure Island will be ruined." Dulles laughed confidently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander remained expressionless, saying, "You shouldn't be so sure."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dulles chuckled, "Well, I look forward to your masterpiece. What dish will you be making? I'll have them assist you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The chefs and assistants gathered around, eagerly observing Alexander as they whispered among themselves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He's so young. Has he even trained as a chef?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even if he has, he's probably just an apprentice. That young man really doesn't know his place."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He dares to compare himself to Mr. </span><span>Clement's</span><span> cooking and wager a million. He must have money to burn."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They all shook their heads, none of them believing in Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ignoring their murmurs, Alexander calmly stated, "Today, I'm going to make some beef pasta. I need the best beef, pasta with a good bite, onions, and garlic."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He listed everything he needed in one breath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone was stunned, thinking, "Just making a plate of beef pasta?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dulles asked in confusion, "Mr. Hawthorne, are you seriously just planning to make a plate of beef pasta to win against me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's right. I only need a simple plate of beef pasta to win against you," Alexander affirmed with a nod.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dulles scoffed, saying disdainfully, "Mr. Hawthorne, do you not know how to make anything grand? Is beef pasta all you can cook?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Others quickly chimed in. "Exactly, he can only make beef pasta. With that level of skill, he dares to bet against Mr. Clement?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He probably knows he's going to lose for sure, so he's settling for making a plate of pasta to get by. Otherwise, losing without fighting would be too embarrassing."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Some self-proclaimed clever individuals tried to explain Alexander's actions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dulles burst into triumphant laughter and quickly ordered the chefs and assistants, "What are you all standing there for? Quickly prepare everything Mr. Hawthorne needs. Get the best ingredients, and don't cut any corners.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Otherwise, if Mr. Hawthorne fails, he may blame it on our ingredients."</span></p><div class="pagination">
