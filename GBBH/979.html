  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Everyone, let me examine it. If this is truly a cursed ring crafted by an ancient wizard, it could be valuable for collection and study."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At that moment, a white-haired old man stepped forward from the crowd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Yes, let Mr. Knight inspect it. He is a true wizard!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This is Mr. Knight's area of expertise. He knows witchcraft."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Edwin appeared calm but secretly observed Alexander. He was a notable wizard in the City of Sorcery. Of course he knew Alexander, the influential figure behind the current city lord.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The current city lord had risen to power with Alexander's support, so he stood up and took the opportunity to please Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Pretending to examine the ring, Edwin sighed deeply and declared, "This is indeed a cursed ring created by a wizard. It drains the wearer's life force and can lead to death."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The crowd erupted in shock. A cursed ring held no value for ordinary people.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Moreover, ancient witchcrafts were largely lost, offering little for a wizard to study.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Besides, no one would dare wear a cursed ring.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Asher's expression darkened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He gritted his teeth and said, "Even if this is a cursed ring, it's still collectible and far more valuable than whatever gift Alexander has."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Alexander, if you're capable, show us your gift," Asher challenged, desperate to salvage his position.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He believed Alexander's gift box contained something of little worth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander smiled faintly, opened his gift box, and a radiant light emerged, revealing a ruby necklace at its center.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Moreover, this ruby was very pure red, with shining red light, and was obviously a priceless and top-grade gem.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This is an extreme ruby, no doubt worth at least fifty million dollars!" Edwin exclaimed after a glance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Not fifty million dollars!" Edwin suddenly gasped, rushing to the necklace, eyes wide in disbelief. "This is a protective necklace. The Spellweave Pattern indicates it can only be made by a white wizard."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'm certain this necklace can block witchcraft. It's an invaluable protective treasure!" Edwin shouted, unable to contain his excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The hall fell silent, the tension palpable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Not only was the necklace crafted from exquisite rubies, but it was also a protective treasure created by a white wizard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone knew how precious a protective treasure that could resist witchcraft was. It's worth beyond mere money.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Some doubted Edwin's claims, thinking he was exaggerating, but few dared to question him, given his status as a wizard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Grace blushed, staring at Alexander in disbelief. She never expected that Alexander would give her such a precious gift.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She thought, "Does he like me too?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Grace's mind was in a mess.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Madelyn noticed her friend's expression and the necklace, feeling a pang of jealousy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Impossible! This can't be true! How could he possess a protective treasure made by a white wizard? You must be in cahoots, trying to deceive me!" Asher protested angrily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Edwin retorted coldly, "Mr. Vance, although you are the heir of the Vance family and have higher status and wealth than me, I am also a wizard in the City of Sorcery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You can't question my integrity or expertise. This is a valuable protective treasure, far surpassing your cursed ring.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If you doubt me, have any wizard appraise it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Edwin glared at Asher fiercely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He was confident in his backing from the City of Sorcery. So, he was not afraid of Asher.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This necklace was a protective necklace made by Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, he also wanted to establish a good relationship with the Lawson family. Given the Lawson family's background, even if he gave gifts worth tens or hundreds of millions, others might not care much.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So he took out this extraordinary protective necklace, which would undoubtedly astonish the Lawson family.</span></p><div class="pagination">
