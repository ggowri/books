  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aiden and Angelica could only watch Julia become the new head of the family, and the management rights of Gemstone Street also belonged to Julia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angelica was completely depressed. She was now nobody.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had previously relied on the power of the Ulysses family to offend many people on Gemstone Street. Now everyone was cursing at her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aiden and Angelica were almost drowned in the saliva of the crowd, and they quickly carried Kevin away in shame.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you, Alexander!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Xavier was so grateful to Alexander that he almost cried with excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smiled and patted his shoulder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're welcome, we were old classmates. I'll need some gems in the future, and I hope you can help me collect them."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julia and Xavier agreed immediately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this time, Alexander's cell phone rang, and he saw it was Edward calling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne, we have already made the mask you requested. We used the latest materials and technology, and it is indistinguishable from the real face."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander became excited and immediately asked Edward to send the mask to the villa personally, and then discussed with Augusta Dent how to get to Treasure Island.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Boss, this is the identity I asked someone to get for you. You are an elite member of the Brilliant Group, named Edison. As long as the Federer family's human face mask can pass the test, you can sneak in without anyone noticing."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Augusta handed the identity information to Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander flipped through the information and memorized it all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had made up his mind and said, "Don't waste time. I will go as soon as possible. The affairs in </span><span>Loscity</span><span> will be left to you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander opened the satellite map and confirmed the location of Treasure Island.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This island was six or seven hundred kilometers away from the mainland. After being purchased by Guzman, it had become a no-man's land.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So</span><span> it was a lawless place with Guzman's people and some big forces involved. It had a huge influence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander began to make a series of preparations for exploring Treasure Island.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He brought two pistols and several magazines, which was rare for him. He also wore the latest type of lightweight inner armor, which was bulletproof and stab-proof. He should be more careful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for the mask sent by Edward, Alexander was very satisfied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The mask was as thin as a cicada's wing, very close to the skin, and was breathable. After putting it on, he became Edison, with no flaws visible at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Treasure Island was on the high seas. Alexander planned to go abroad with the help of the Saint Group, otherwise, it would be troublesome to carry weapons with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He dialed Alice's number.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Hollister!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne, you finally remembered to call me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alice's joyful and resentful voice came over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander could only smile bitterly. He had been developing his power recently and didn't want Alice to know too much.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alice had been seducing him, so Alexander deliberately stayed away from her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I have something for you to do. I'm going to an island..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Treasure Island! You're going to Guzman's base?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alice was confused, of course she knew about Treasure Island.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was not just because of Guzman, but also because Treasure Island was famous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Many gangsters regarded Treasure Island as a paradise, but the vast majority of people believed that Treasure Island was a cancer that must be eradicated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Some people in </span><span>Mesco</span><span> had been pushing for legislation to take back Treasure Island.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, because Treasure Island was not only related to the interest of Guzman but also because many bigwigs in </span><span>Mesco</span><span> were involved, it never succeeded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander said firmly, "Of course, I will go. Nothing ventured, nothing gained!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next day, the sky was cloudless and a helicopter landed on the beach.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was already a luxury yacht waiting here. After Alexander boarded the cruise ship, he headed to Treasure Island in the sea.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The yacht had been traveling at full speed for almost a day when a huge island was seen in the distance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Treasure Island covered an area of more than ten square kilometers. The island was lush and green, with a large number of buildings hidden among the dense vegetation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The yacht lowered a small speedboat, and Alexander rode the speedboat quickly towards Treasure Island.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had put on a mask and was dressed as Edison.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After the speedboat arrived at the dock, Alexander found that although it seemed calm on the surface, the yacht had been targeted by several hidden artillery pieces and even anti-ship missiles.</span></p><div class="pagination">
