Alexander pulled Alice behind him to protect her and warned them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you don't want trouble, you'd better call your captain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Pooh!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jair spat in front of Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you think you can see our captain whenever you want? Who do you think you are? Do you think you can boss us around? Are you insane!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thin man also grinned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Brat, this woman is ours. Kneel."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While showing off, he reached out to pinch Alexander's throat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander kicked him away with one kick. With a bang, the thin man broke the cabin glass and fell into the sea. The shrill screams quickly disappeared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The others didn't expect Alexander would be so tough to handle, and they were so scared that they stood there in a daze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander rushed over and slapped Jair hard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jair was knocked to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The other two crew members roared and swung their fists at Alexander, but Alexander struck first and hit them hard in the throat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, the two of them fell straight to the ground without a sound.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jair was so frightened. He struggled to get up and turned around to run. He felt a pain in his buttocks and saw himself flying up and falling towards the sea.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jair soon disappeared into the vast ocean.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this time, someone roared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander saw the captain and a dozen crew members coming. Some held shotguns, and some held axes and sticks, rushing over aggressively.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two crew members who were lucky enough to be alive were overjoyed and crawled towards the captain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They complained first, "Captain, he ... he is a murderer, a monster! He killed Jair..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The captain was furious. "Damn it, you bastard!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>More than a dozen crew members pointed their weapons at Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, yes, this bastard!" The two crew members were overjoyed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The captain picked up his stick and beat the two guys hard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who the fuck do you think you are! How dare you offend our distinguished guests. Fuck!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He swung the stick and smashed it down hard, beating the two crew members so hard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone was shocked. They didn't expect the captain would beat up his subordinates.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The captain stopped until their faces were covered in blood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He quickly ran to Alexander, bowed, and apologized.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne, I'm sorry. These bastards didn't know that you were a distinguished guest. I'm sorry, they deserve to die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone suddenly realized that Alexander was a distinguished guest of Cloe, the president of the Brilliant Group. They were courting death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander waved his hand contemptuously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Keep your men under control and don't bother us again."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hugged Alice and walked towards his room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, yes, Mr. Hawthorne, rest assured. I promise that these bastards will not dare to disturb you again. Those who violate this will be killed!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The captain patted his chest and assured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone looked at Alexander's handsome and elegant back, with a beautiful woman in his arms. It was enviable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as Alexander and Alice returned to the room, Alice suddenly exerted force and pushed him down on the sofa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alice panted and eagerly helped Alexander undress.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne, I miss you..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander didn't hesitate and kissed her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alice's body was plump and sexy, especially her plump breasts, which exuded an alluring sweet fragrance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alice's bra was torn off by Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander kissed her breasts. Alice couldn't wait any longer and put her hand into Alexander's pants.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alice's breathing became extremely heavy and her eyes were seductive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne, stop teasing me..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander couldn't bear it any longer. Soon, the two naked bodies were entangled tightly together...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Alexander woke up, it was already early in the morning. Under Alice's </span><span>pestering, the two of them slept in the room for most of the day.</span></p><div class="pagination">
