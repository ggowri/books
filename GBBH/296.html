  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melin lay on the ground, struggling to get up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosen sneered as he approached, looking down at her with disdain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bitch, you'll pay for this," he taunted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His menacing look terrified Melin. "Stay back! I'll kill anyone who touches me!" she shouted, desperately searching for a way to escape. But with her right side injured, running was impossible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosen unzipped his pants, ready to act. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander couldn't stand by any longer. He had a good impression of Melin; there weren't many fearless officers left like her. No decent person would allow such an atrocity to occur.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Rosen was about to assault Melin, Alexander intervened. "Stop!" he shouted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sudden command startled Rosen and his men, causing them to step back in surprise. Alexander wore a silver mask and a guard's hat to conceal his identity, carrying an assault rifle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosen glared at him, angered by the interruption. "Who the hell are you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's Andy's hat! He must have killed him!" one of the men yelled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fuck! Is he alone?" another questioned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander calmly approached and stood in front of Melin, shielding her. "Let Frank and Officer Melin go. Do what you want with the others, and I'll pretend I saw nothing."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melin, feeling like a drowning person who'd found a lifeline, quickly hid behind </span><span>Alexander. She blushed, feeling safe in his presence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why are you hiding? Take off that mask!" Rosen shouted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ignoring him, Alexander turned to help Melin, placing his hand gently on her right side to heal her with the Force. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melin felt a touch near her chest and initially panicked, wondering if he was another threat. But soon, warmth spread through her body, easing her pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This feels incredible. What kind of magic is this?" Melin exclaimed as her injury healed rapidly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn you both! How dare you act intimate in front of me!" Rosen cursed, stepping forward. But something about Alexander made him hesitate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melin's injury was healed, yet she continued to cling to Alexander. He felt her soft chest and was momentarily distracted. Her shoulder strap had been cut, exposing part of her breast. Melin noticed his stare and blushed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosen roared, "What are you waiting for? Mike, Tony, get him! I want him alive!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mike and Tony advanced confidently. "Kneel now, and you'll suffer less," they taunted, spreading out to attack Alexander from both sides.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mike leaped high, aiming a powerful elbow strike at Alexander's head, while Tony crouched low, thrusting a dagger at his thigh. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were elite fighters, working seamlessly together&mdash;an attack even Augusta and Marvin would find hard to evade.</span></p><div class="pagination">
