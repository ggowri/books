  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're definitely overreacting. Must not have gotten enough sleep," Hyena said, and </span><span>his</span><span> </span><span>eyes narrowed with displeasure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let me see. Venom Wolf probably just saw it wrong. We're too far away and well hidden. No way that guy could have spotted us," Black Widow said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though she tried to sound confident, something was nagging at her. A subtle feeling of unease she couldn't shake. But she dismissed it as just paranoia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's just take him out when we get the chance. Once he's dead, we can head back and collect our pay," Black Widow continued. To her, the only way to truly feel at ease was to complete the job.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sounds good. Black Widow, once we get paid, I'm taking a nice long break. To find some hot chicks to have fun with!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey, count me in! Can't have a party with hot chicks without me," Red Eye and Venom Wolf chuckled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hyena's eyes had narrowed to slits, and </span><span>his</span><span> </span><span>sinister smile unsettled. "You guys can have your hot chicks. I'm going to find myself some young and handsome men! If Alexander wasn't worth so much, I'd love to play with him first."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The other three broke into a cold sweat at her words. Any man who caught Hyena's eye ended up wishing for death before the end.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wait... where did Alexander go?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Black Widow let out a gasp. Alexander had vanished from her scope. He was just gone, nowhere to be found.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Calm down, will you? He probably just moved somewhere we can't see. Stop freaking everyone out, Black Widow."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Red Eye and Venom Wolf kept scanning, but Alexander was nowhere in sight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Everyone, since you've made the trip to Treasure Island, why hide in the shadows?" A smooth and rich voice suddenly cut through the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Who the hell was that? All four of them whirled around. Their faces went pale, and their expressions were frozen in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander stood right behind them. And none of them had noticed him getting there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Alexander had wanted them dead just now, they would be. They'd have died without even knowing what hit them, completely clueless until their last breath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander stood there with a brilliant smile, and his clothes rippled in the sea breeze, the picture of effortless grace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're with Sakra Society, aren't you? And Rico's pirates... You sent them too, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How did you know? Were you... were you eavesdropping this whole time?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Black Widow's face darkened. This guy had been lurking behind them, catching every word.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She realized that the power gap between them and Alexander was massive. They weren't even in the same league. This was bad, really bad.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cold sweat beaded on their foreheads, soaking through their clothes. Even Hyena, usually ready with a sharp tongue, kept </span><span>his</span><span> </span><span>mouth shut.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Take him down! Kill him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Black Widow exploded into action with a roar, whipping out a Desert Eagle fitted with a silencer. Without hesitation, she emptied the entire clip at Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, Red Eye's throwing knives sliced through the air, and their edges gleamed with an eerie blue tint. Just one nick from those poisoned blades would be lethal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A deadly web of bullets and blades converged on Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Venom Wolf rolled in low, combat knife flashing as he went for Alexander's ankles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Behind them, Hyena took a different approach, chambering a round in </span><span>his</span><span> </span><span>sniper rifle and lining up a clean headshot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These weren't amateurs</span><span>&mdash;</span><span>they were elite assassins who'd worked together for years, and it showed. Their coordination was perfect as they launched their ambush, led by Black Widow's aggressive charge. Alexander found himself caught in their deadly crossfire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It all happened in a split second. They were just feet away from Alexander, their attack executed with lightning speed and flawless teamwork. In their minds, no one could survive this</span><span>&mdash;</span><span>it was impossible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Alexander just stared down the incoming bullets and blades without even flinching.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Not bad. You've got skills. I can see why you call yourselves Sakra Society's trump card." A smirk played across his face. "But if this is all you've got? Hate to break it to </span><span>you, but you're going to need to do better than that!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
