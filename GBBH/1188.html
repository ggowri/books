  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That hand seemed to have an iron grip on his ankle, holding him in place with supernatural strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rico's face darkened with rage. His leg strikes were his deadliest weapon</span><span>&mdash;</span><span>powerful enough to snap a tree trunk.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, even with all his might, he couldn't break free from Alexander's single-handed hold. The sheer power Alexander possessed was terrifying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Remembering what happened to his men, Rico was appalled as he desperately tried to wrench himself free from Alexander's control.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, searing pain shot through his ankle. The world spun as Alexander swung him through the air like a human propeller, faster and faster until everything blurred.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let me go!" Rico roared, spinning helplessly with stars dancing in his vision.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a thunderous crash, Alexander slammed him into the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blood sprayed from Rico's mouth as pain exploded through his body. He felt as fragile as glass, every bone threatening to shatter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His remaining men stood frozen in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rico was their idol</span><span>&mdash;</span><span>a legendary pirate boss who led a crew of hundreds, terrorizing the seas, leaving a trail of bodies, and walking away with mountains of cash.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But this time was different. Rico had gathered his elite warriors, hand-picking dozens </span><span>of his best men for a high-stakes mission</span><span>&mdash;</span><span>taking control of Treasure Island from Alexander and Cloe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The situation spiraled completely out of their control.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What they'd thought would be a perfect ambush turned into their worst nightmare. Alexander wasn't their prey. They were his.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander slammed Rico into the ground yet again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The remaining pirates watched in horror as the impact left a crater in the concrete. Blood poured from Rico's mouth as his body seized violently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, Alexander hurled Rico skyward. As Rico hung suspended in the air, Alexander launched himself upward like a living rocket. Alexander's fist connected with Rico's waist in mid-air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sound of breaking bone echoed through the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rico's body twisted into this weird, unnatural shape. He slammed into the ground like a meteorite.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blood started fountaining from his mouth, one gush after another, and his body twitched non-stop. Everyone knew he wasn't going to make it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander just scoffed, spat on Rico's broken body, and turned his attention to the surviving pirates.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To them, Alexander wasn't just some fighter anymore. He was the Grim Reaper himself, walking straight out of hell and into their worst nightmare.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stay back! We surrender! We messed up!" The pirates scrambled backward, and their voices shook with terror.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's laugh was ice-cold. "Those who surrender, kneel and live!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Several pirates dropped to their knees instantly, trembling like leaves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander kept walking toward the holdouts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A bald guy with crazy eyes started screaming, "Don't surrender! They'll work us to death as slaves. That's worse than dying!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Rico's dead now, so I'm in charge! Go! Kill him, and I'll split all our crew's fortune with you! We're talking hundreds of millions of dollars! All of it, split between us if we take him down!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The bald guy was going totally off the rails, using money like a magic wand to boost morale.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Money made people do crazy things. Pirates were even crazier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The scared pirates suddenly switched up really quick. These guys lived for cash. It was why they became pirates in the first place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The seven who stayed standing</span><span>&mdash;</span><span>their eyes went blood-red at the mention of all that money. The killer instinct came flooding back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Greed made them forget what they were scared of in the first place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's go! He's just a man. He can die like anyone else!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah! With that kind of money, we're set for life!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All seven of them, including the bald guy, charged at Alexander like rabid wolves. Some had guns, and others had knives. They were howling like complete psychos.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A storm of bullets and flashing blades surrounded Alexander, threatening to swallow </span><span>him whole.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Watch out!" Cloe couldn't help but call out, and worry was clear in her voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What followed was a symphony of chaos</span><span>&mdash;</span><span>screams of pain, bones snapping like twigs, bodies hitting the ground one after another.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The bald guy's eyes nearly popped out of his skull as he watched half his crew drop in seconds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the blink of an eye, he was the last man standing, and his buddies' blood was splattered all over him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Alexander looked like he just stepped out of a department store. There was not a single drop of blood on him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every step Alexander took forward sent the bald guy stumbling back.</span></p><div class="pagination">
