  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grace pouted, clearly annoyed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You all forced me into this. I don't like him! He's just a petty guy and a pervert, ugh!" she muttered under her breath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gavin sighed, helpless. He had no way of dealing with his granddaughter's stubbornness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Alexander got home, he found Lily sitting with Ava, chatting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lily, what are you doing here? You should've just called me! I would've come over to see you," Alexander greeted her with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily wiped the tears from her eyes, then took his hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, I know you're busy now, but your mother's death anniversary is coming up in two days. We should go pay our respects."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander froze for a second, completely forgetting about it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're right. Let's go now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's mother was buried at a cemetery at the foot of a hill on the western outskirts of </span><span>Loscity</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was the largest cemetery in the city, with rows of tombstones stretching far into the distance, creating a solemn and heavy atmosphere.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander carried Ashley, and with Lily and Ava, they arrived at the cemetery gate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since his mother's anniversary was in two days, he had come early to clean her grave and prepare for the memorial.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he looked at the cemetery, a place that felt both familiar and foreign to him, Alexander's face grew somber.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His mother had passed away before he could ever give her the life she deserved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A deep ache in his chest made it hard to breathe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't be sad," Ava said softly, trying to comfort him. "Your mother would be so proud of everything you've achieved. She'd be happy for you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava wasn't sure how to console him, so she changed the subject, mentioning the deal with Gavin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Giving exclusive rights to a few powerful countries is a long-term win. It'll also keep the Ghost from causing us trouble."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava was fully on board with the idea.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They might earn a little less, but to Alexander, money was no longer the priority. He had bigger things to worry about.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had bigger things to worry about. After all, if a real crisis ever hit, money would be useless. The exclusive rights could be traded for food, weapons, and other supplies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander nodded quietly. "Yeah, I get it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They continued toward his mother's grave. With every step, Alexander felt the weight of the grief pressing harder on his chest, suffocating him with every breath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The grave was tucked away in a quiet corner, far from the main paths.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The area was overgrown with weeds, and dead branches scattered around. Alexander hurriedly began clearing the area.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily grabbed a broom to sweep the leaves, and Ava used a cloth to clean bird droppings from the tombstone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>None of them spoke. They simply worked in silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander crouched down in front of the tombstone, his tears flowing freely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had never known his father. His mother was all he had from childhood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her face, so familiar yet fading with time, was growing harder to remember. But he tried, and with effort, he could still bring her image to life in his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom, I brought Ashley, Lily, and Ava to see you," he said softly, his hand gently brushing over the tombstone as if he could feel her smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even someone as strong-willed as Alexander couldn't stop the tears from flowing. The deep, aching longing surged within him, and the pain was almost too much to bear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava felt her heart twist with empathy. She could sense the loneliness and sorrow Alexander had buried deep inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her eyes grew misty, and she whispered something in Ashley's ear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Grandma, I'm here to see you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ashley, wise beyond her years, spoke softly, "Rest well, Grandma."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smiled through his tears, feeling a sense of peace wash over him as he patted his daughter's head. The sadness in his heart, though still present, felt a little lighter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily was crying too, holding onto Ava's hand, letting the tears flow freely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Alexander finished arranging the flowers he </span><span>brought,</span><span> he heard footsteps approaching.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A group of people was coming their way, talking loudly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That perfect burial plot is just ahead. We're almost there!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Didn't know Sir Vance was from </span><span>Loscity</span><span>. This spot is a real find. Once we get it, Sir Vance will reward us big time!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Once we get our hands on it, Sir Vance promised I'll become the cemetery manager."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Congratulations, Ryder!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their laughter and congratulations grew louder as they drew nearer.</span></p><div class="pagination">
