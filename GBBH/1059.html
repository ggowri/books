  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wayne took action first, trying to kick Alexander in the stomach.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a mighty attack!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Wayne hit him, Alexander would definitely be blown off his feet.</span><span> </span><span>Moreover, he might be killed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ariella could not help but exclaim, "</span><span>Watch</span><span> out!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander turned to her and smiled as if nothing</span><span> serious</span><span> had happened, "Don't worry. It's no big deal."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, to everyone's surprise, Alexander dodged Wayne's kick.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wayne's face immediately darkened. As his confident attack missed its mark, he realized it was definitely not a fluke.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was unusually calm. After comforting Ariella, he easily avoided Wayne</span><span>'s</span><span> kick and did not strike back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wayne gritted his teeth and attacked</span><span> </span><span>Alexander repeatedly without hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He used the trump cards he had acquired in underground boxing, throwing punches and kicks with lightning speed and great force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He believed that even a master couldn't bear his counterattack and that th</span><span>is</span><span> </span><span>young man</span><span> would at least get hurt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wayne screamed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, he couldn't take back his fist</span><span>s</span><span>, and a sharp pain came.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Somehow, his right fist had been caught by Alexander as if by a pair of pliers, and he couldn't struggle at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"L-Let go of me..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a panic, Wayne looked completely pale.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander sneered, "Let go of you? Were</span><span>n't you so wild and arrogant just now</span><span>?</span><span> Go on!</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander kicked Wayne hard. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because Wayne</span><span>'s</span><span> fist was held by Alexander, he couldn't hide</span><span> even</span><span> if he wanted to.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chase and the others were shocked that Wayne</span><span> was kicked away heavily</span><span>, like a leaf blown away by a strong wind, </span><span>flying </span><span>and slamming </span><span>on</span><span> the wall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wayne screamed in pain and coughed up blood nonstop.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone from the Obsidian Gang stepped back in fear, and several women</span><span> started shivering</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chase hugged Wayne anxiously and shouted, "Wayne! </span><span>Are you all right</span><span>?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gore and Wayne were </span><span>both </span><span>his right-hand men, and now both of them were killed. Therefore, Chase was frightened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wayne spewed out another big mouthful of blood, which splashed all over Chase, and then completely lost consciousness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bastard!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chase's expression was ferocious, and the muscles of his face twitched. He flew into a rage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come on and kill them!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He roared like a madman, "</span><span>Charge</span><span>! Anyone who </span><span>kills them</span><span> will be rewarded with one million dollars!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The members of the Obsidian Gang came back to their senses and were ecstatic. They rushed to Alexander, Ariella, and Rosalia like </span><span>hungry </span><span>wolves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a pale face, Ariella remained composed because Alexander and Rosalia gave her great confidence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosalia flickered in front of her to protect her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're all losers!" Alexander snorted with disdain before disappearing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When his figure reappeared, he had already dashed into the crowd in the Obsidian Gang, just like an invincible guy in a game.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At least one member of the Obsidian Gang was knocked down, either dead or disabled, by each of his casual moves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those with guns became the focus of attention and were first attacked and defeated by Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A group of people surrounded Alexander aggressively, but they didn't even touch a corner of his clothes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the blink of an eye, the weapons scattered all over the floor, which was littered with people, and the screams echoed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander still showed mercy to the members of the Obsidian Gang. He just dislocated their limbs at most instead of killing them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ariella, after all, was going to take over th</span><span>is </span><span>gang. The members, who had been taught a lesson, would naturally </span><span>serve </span><span>her</span><span> with respect</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chase shivered all over, feeling that he was doomed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he knew that Ariella had such a</span><span> strong </span><span>friend, he would never dare to </span><span>steal </span><span>Ariella</span><span>'s power and position. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite having been fighting on Aetheris Street for more than 20 years, Chase had never met such a powerful figure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't help trembling at the thought that he was about to face revenge, and a chill ran through him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander walked to him and smiled, "</span><span>Chase, now do</span><span> you </span><span>agree</span><span> you are </span><span>a </span><span>blind</span><span> dog</span><span>?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was a dead silence!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chase stared at Alexander </span><span>with hatred, with a pale face, </span><span>and </span><span>he </span><span>mumbled something to himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander</span><span> was pretending! This young brat </span><span>had deceived him by pretending to be a weak gigolo</span><span>!</span></p><div class="pagination">
