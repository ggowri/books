Everything is going smoothly with Jake."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Salman narrowed his eyes, a cold glint of malice flashing through them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Jake's operation is the perfect dress rehearsal for our Apocalypse Project.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"To our success, General Bowen. Cheers!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yinson poured two glasses of red wine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Cheers!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They clinked glasses and drank in one go before turning their attention to Elaine, who had just regained consciousness. Like ravenous wolves, they pounced on her once again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander was reviewing plans for his upcoming trip to Risun when his phone buzzed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The call was from Craig Bennett, his college roommate and an old friend. Back in their university days, they had been close, but life had taken them in different directions. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After graduation, Alexander's struggles under the Fairfax family's oppressive rule had made him reluctant to stay in touch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It had been three or four years since their last meeting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander picked up, and Craig's boisterous voice filled the line.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Alexander! It's Craig! Man, it's been forever. We're having a college reunion tonight. Bring someone if you want&mdash;plus-ones are welcome. You've gotta come!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Sure, I'll be there," Alexander replied without hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He'd skipped previous reunions, finding the endless boasting and comparisons unbearable during his tougher years. But now, things were different.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Originally, he thought of bringing Ava, but she had spent the day shopping and helping him, leaving her too exhausted to attend. After a moment's thought, Alexander decided to have Alice accompany him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alice, his sharp and capable secretary, had been handling much of the tedious work as Alexander consolidated his position as the Godfather's sole heir. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her unwavering support made her indispensable, even though she had often been overlooked amidst the chaos.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A sleek sports car pulled up outside a trendy restaurant. As Alexander and Alice stepped out, a surprised voice called out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Alexander!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander turned to see Craig, his old friend.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ha! You actually came. That's awesome!" Craig exclaimed, his round face lighting up with joy as he gave Alexander a bear hug.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Craig's attention shifted to Alice, and his eyebrows shot up in surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Wait a minute... is this your wife?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander smiled. "No, this is Alice, my secretary."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Craig's eyes widened, and he chuckled, clearly impressed. "You're kidding, right? With your... well, you know, your financial situation back in the day, how did you manage to hire a secretary&mdash;especially one this stunning?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander laughed but offered no explanation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alice, ever composed, gave Craig a polite smile and stayed close to Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Craig, clearly smitten, stammered, "Well... um... nice to meet you, Miss Alice."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He extended a hand awkwardly, trying to appear respectful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alice shook his hand with a soft smile, her calm demeanor throwing him off balance. Craig's face flushed red as he tried not to stare, especially when Alice's laugh caused the slightest bounce.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander clapped Craig on the shoulder, snapping him out of his daze. "Come on, buddy. Let's head inside."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Craig coughed, embarrassed, and motioned toward the entrance. "Yeah, let's go."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Inside the restaurant, the energy was vibrant. Though not a luxury venue, it had a trendy charm and was packed with diners enjoying their meals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As they walked through the bustling space, Alexander asked casually, "Who's organizing this reunion?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Craig answered quickly, "Bobby Murray. You remember him, right? That guy's rolling in cash now. Just... try not to start anything with him. You two didn't exactly get along back in the day."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander chuckled, a hint of sarcasm in his tone. "Bobby's made it big, huh?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Craig nodded eagerly. "Yeah, the guy's practically flaunting it. But, uh, you might want to keep things cool. No need to dredge up old grudges, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander smiled faintly but said nothing, memories of Bobby's antics flashing in his mind.</span></p><div class="pagination">
