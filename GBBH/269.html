Even if they didn't respect Ava, they had to respect his magic powder, giving him plenty of leeway.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Still, Charles thought Alexander's tone was a bit too bold, despite his position and influence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne, my apologies for bothering you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Charles gave Alexander a long look before leading his men out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wiping her tears, Lily said, "Alexander, I apologize on their behalf..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander reassured her, "Don't worry, Aunt. If they can truly change, I'll help them."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you, Alexander!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily was moved to tears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then Betty called in the hired help and caregivers, instructing them to take good care of Lily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander left the villa, got back into his car, and sighed softly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a shame Nick was such an ungrateful son, or Alexander truly would've helped them to let his aunt's family enjoy a peaceful old age.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Betty spoke seriously, "Boss, tonight's Hansen family banquet might be a trap, mainly targeting you and the Saint Group."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander scoffed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Orion is definitely counting on his backers. I want to see which military players are supporting him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, Boss, you're amazing; just be a bit cautious..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Betty purred softly as she snuggled closer to Alexander, leaving her intentions clear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander chuckled, reaching out to give her full, soft chest a squeeze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Betty blushed, taking the chance to slip into Alexander's arms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Boss, when you went to Treasure Island with Alice, did you sleep with her?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's face reddened; he neither confirmed nor denied it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Betty gazed at Alexander intently, still unable to figure out why he had such a magnetic charm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander, on the other hand, was admiring Betty's outfit today.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wore a light blue blazer over a fitted white silk blouse, with her full chest seeming ready to burst out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under her short black skirt were long, slender legs, fair and captivating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Boss, I've missed you so much these days..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Betty held Alexander passionately, her wide, dewy eyes filled with tenderness and longing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey, missed me? Or are you just looking for a treat?" Alexander smirked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He gave a sly grin, letting his hand explore her thigh, trailing toward the inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah, we're still in the car... there are people outside..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Betty's face turned a deep shade of red as her chest rose and fell.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander didn't stop his hand; instead, he went further.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop! Please... not in the car. Let's wait until we're back..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why? I want to fuck you in the car."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without any another word, Alexander pressed his lips to hers, drawing her warm tongue into a deep kiss.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You are such a savage! Then let's do it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Betty's face glowed, putting on a proud, unyielding expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander chuckled. "Looks like Ms. Rowe is getting crazy."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop teasing me! Just wait and see. I'll have you surrender in no time!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Betty was strong-willed, even in matters of love, never backing down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright then! I'd like to see how you plan to make me surrender."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander unbuttoned Betty's blouse, and her full curves spilled into view.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Betty took control, straddling Alexander with her round, shapely figure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, well, never expected you to be this wild, Ms. Rowe." Alexander said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander gave a mischievous laugh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Betty panted </span><span>softly,</span><span> her fair skin flushed with pink.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't you laugh! Whoever surrenders first is the little puppy!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, bring out all your moves."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander channeled the Force, turning himself into a powerhouse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Betty's luscious lips parted as her body trembled uncontrollably.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The car rocked intensely for quite a while.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a full hour, Betty lay collapsed against Alexander, practically melted, with no strength left to resist.</span></p><div class="pagination">
