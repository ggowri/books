  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander quickly grasped Augusta's arm and gave it a firm shake.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Why would I ever look down on you?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Billy, get in touch with the best hospital and arrange for her transfer. Extend her life span as possible as we can. Don't worry about the cost; just make it happen," Alexander ordered, his tone leaving no room for argument.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Augusta's lips trembled, and his eyes glistened with unshed tears.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Thank you, boss!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He sincerely adjusted his title for Alexander, filled with gratitude.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As Alexander glanced at Augusta's injured leg, he sensed through the Force that several tiny shrapnel pieces were still lodged in his right knee.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">They had encountered a fragmentation bomb, and those bits of metal were no bigger than grains of beans, positioned in a way that made them incredibly difficult to remove with current medical techniques.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But Alexander felt confident he could extract the shrapnel and save Augusta's leg using the Force.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I can help with your leg. It might not be perfect, but I can definitely improve your mobility&mdash;probably by about eighty to ninety percent," Alexander said suddenly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Augusta's body stiffened, his eyes widening in disbelief.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Boss, are you serious?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The former Phantom Squad leader's gaze sharpened, as if he were trying to see right through Alexander.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander shrugged nonchalantly. "Your wife will have a dedicated caregiver arranged by Billy. I'll take care of your leg. Just a few small pieces of shrapnel; it's an easy fix."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Thank you, boss. After I was injured, I ended up in the best military hospital, but even the top specialists were hesitant to remove all the shrapnel. They were afraid of damaging the nerves and leaving me completely disabled..." Augusta said, his voice heavy with emotion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Don't worry; now that you're calling me boss, I'll definitely help you," Alexander reassured him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Thanks, boss. I owe you my life," Augusta replied, his expression resolute.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Don't think like that. I want you to live well, rebuild your family, and find happiness again," Alexander said, his words like warm sunlight, pushing away the shadows hanging over Augusta's heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As Augusta glanced back at his ailing wife, he remembered her earlier words, and his heart ached.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She wanted him to follow Alexander and hoped he would find happiness in the future.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This battle-hardened man, forged in the fires of conflict, couldn't hold back his tears once more.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander said, his voice steady, "Augusta, you don't have a place to stay right now. You can come live with me.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"The 'magic powder' that's been all the rage lately? That's Billy's doing. There are plenty of folks eyeing it, so I need to recruit some top-notch talent to help me out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If you have any friends who want to join us, I'd be more than happy to welcome them aboard. I promise you won't be shortchanged.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"We're talking a starting salary of 100 thousand plus bonuses. You'll be making no less than 500 thousand dollars a year, possibly even over a million. What do you say?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Augusta paused for a moment; then, his excitement bubbled over.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Boss, with an offer like that, are you sure you won't suffer losses?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Ha! Augusta, you're an elite. Don't sell yourself short. Together, we'll carve out a piece of the world for ourselves!" Alexander clapped him on the shoulder, his enthusiasm infectious.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After a moment of thought, Augusta replied, "Boss, I have three good buddies. If you don't mind, I can bring them along to help."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander beamed. "Phantom Squad elites? I won't turn them away!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Augusta sighed, his expression darkening.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Boss, their situation isn't quite what you might expect. Let me show you first."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His eyes were filled with a complex mix of emotions.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What's the issue? Just lay it on me. I'll do what I can to help," Alexander urged.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"My three comrades, just like me, were injured and ended up offending the higher-ups. They were dismissed and sent home. Life's been tough for them, and they're all dealing with injuries," Augusta explained, his voice heavy with concern.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander waved off the thanks with a casual gesture.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Don't worry about it. If I can help, I will. Even if we can't fix everything, remember, they're Phantom Squad elite. They're a lot tougher than the average person."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Augusta's eyes misted up with gratitude. "That's great to hear! On their behalf, thank you, boss!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"As long as you don't mind us, I swear to God, from now on, our lives are yours!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After arranging for his wife's transfer, Augusta led Alexander to a rundown neighborhood.</p><div class="pagination">
