  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'm not sure..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Brody spoke hesitantly, his voice trailing off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This caused Oliver to snap. He spun around, his frustration boiling over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What do you mean you are not sure? You're supposed to be the most experienced doctor in this hospital!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He began pacing back and forth, his impatience growing by the second.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Pointing a shaking finger at Brody, he added, "If you can't save Mr. Hawthorne, I'll have you all locked up!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"No, please, don't do that..." Brody held his hands up defensively, his face pale with fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ava's face hardened, her voice trembling with desperation. "What are you saying, Dr. Cook? You're supposed to be the one who saves him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Brody wiped his forehead, his expression pained. "Mr. Hawthorne was poisoned with cyanide... It's a miracle he's even still alive. We've done everything we can. He's still in a coma..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His voice wavered as he continued, "He might recover in a few days, but... there's also a chance... he might end up in a vegetative state..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Shut up! It's all bullshit!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ava suddenly grabbed Brody by the collar, her eyes wide with fury. Without warning, she shoved him harshly against the wall, her breath coming in sharp, ragged gasps.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"We did everything we could! I swear!" Brody pleaded, his face pale with fear as he crumpled under her force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ava stood still, her grip loosening, but her body was frozen, her eyes staring blankly ahead, as though she had lost all focus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The words "vegetative state" echoed in her mind like a distant, haunting scream.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Betty, standing nearby, muttered under her breath, "A vegetative state..." Her lips trembled, her face ashen. She couldn't even process the thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Get out!" Ava screamed, shoving Brody away with all her strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Brody staggered back, his steps shaky, and bolted for the door, his voice trailing behind him as he stumbled over his words. "Sorry, we really tried... I'm sorry, I... I have other matters to attend to..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The other doctors and nurses followed suit, leaving the room quickly. Everyone knew that now, Alexander's survival was entirely in his hands&mdash;his will to live was all that mattered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If he died, they would be held accountable, and they knew all too well the wrath of the high-ranking individuals who would surely hold them responsible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>From a medical standpoint, Alexander's chances of fully recovering were slim to none. Poisoned with cyanide, suffering severe blood loss, and facing life-threatening wounds, it was nothing short of a miracle that he hadn't already died.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Outside the ICU, an oppressive silence hung in the air. Ava, Betty, Rebecca, and the others huddled together, staring through the glass at Alexander's still form lying unconscious in the bed. Tears shimmered in their eyes as they watched him, each one trapped in their own silent grief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Oliver stood apart from the group, leaning against the window, a cigarette dangling from his fingers. His hands trembled slightly, revealing the anxiety and frustration boiling beneath his calm exterior.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Oliver, the scene report is here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A police officer hurried over, handing him a thick folder of documents.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Let me see."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Oliver snatched the papers, scanning them quickly. "As expected, the killers are from the Sakra Society. Their identities have been confirmed. No records of entry&mdash;they must have crossed the border illegally. The older one is Loren, the other is Simeon&hellip;"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The officer hesitated, then leaned closer, his voice lowering. "There's more. The old guy&mdash;Loren&mdash;he's... clearly one of the living dead."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Oliver's brow furrowed, his face tightening with a mix of disbelief and anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Slowly, through clenched teeth, he muttered, "Damn the Sakra Society. Damn Yinson. They're still trying to use the Apocalypse Project to destroy humanity."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Turning to the officer, his voice grew sharper. "Gather all the materials. When you're done, get them to me immediately. I'm reporting this to the higher-ups."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The officer nodded quickly. "Understood, Chief."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Wait. I'm sending experts to the scene for a full investigation."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Oliver wasn't taking any chances. He remembered the horrors at Loscity's outskirts&mdash;how a group of "living dead" had led an army of zombies, nearly causing an apocalypse. Even with thousands of fully-armed soldiers, they had suffered heavy losses before the monsters were eradicated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Now, Loren had become one of them. Oliver had to act fast&mdash;he needed to alert the higher authorities so they could take immediate action against the Sakra Society and Yinson, cutting off the threat at its roots.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Outside the ICU, the tension was suffocating. The silence felt heavier than ever.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ava turned away from the others and spoke to Betty, her voice unwavering despite the fear that gnawed at her heart. "You're in charge now, Betty. Keep the Ultimate Alliance running smoothly. We can't afford to lose control&mdash;not with Alexander like this."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Betty paused, her jaw tightening, but after a long moment, she nodded and gritted her teeth. Without another word, she turned and left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ava then addressed the others, her voice cold and measured. "Augusta, Rosalia, you stay. The rest of you, go home.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I don't want too many people here. Sakra Society might send more assassins, and having too many around could make things worse."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She locked eyes with Charlize. "No matter what, protect Ashley. At all costs."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>No one dared to argue. They obeyed without question, knowing that Ava had the final say in everything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Augusta and Rosalia took up their positions at the ends of the hallway, their faces set with determination.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The elite members of the Ultimate Alliance were on high alert, watching over Alexander's family and the hospital itself. Dozens of guards, both seen and unseen, were strategically placed throughout the area, prepared for any danger that might arise.</span></p><div class="pagination">
