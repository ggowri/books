  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosalia was very excited and stepped on the accelerator, the speed of the BMW getting faster and faster.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What? Someone is blocking the road ahead!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fortunately, she had good eyesight and quick reaction and stepped on the brakes in time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this time, Alexander's calm voice sounded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't waste time. No matter what they are doing, just rush over."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were about to arrive at the Loscity Hospital. Saving lives was the most urgent thing. He was shocked by the doomsday scene on the road and didn't want to waste any time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The soldiers blocking the road saw a BMW speeding toward them and immediately prepared to intercept it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this time, the BMW obviously began to slow down, and the soldiers who were tense also relaxed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just when the BMW seemed to be about to stop, there was another loud sound!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosalia stepped on the accelerator, and the BMW's engine roared. The soldiers knew that the driver must have stepped on the accelerator to the bottom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was about to rush over!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop now! Or we'll shoot!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The guarding soldiers roared and reacted quickly, raising their automatic rifles and aiming at the BMW.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosalia smiled, revealing a sarcastic smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was not worried at all. He calmly lit a cigarette and took a puff.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This BMW was not an ordinary 7 Series but a specially modified one.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not only did it have a twelve-cylinder engine with more than 400 horsepower, but the entire body was covered with light armor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even the tires and glass were bulletproof. Although the automatic rifles of those soldiers were powerful, they could not penetrate the car and glass.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fierce gunfire rang out, and the BMW had already broken through the roadblock and sped away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Chase them! Report quickly!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The soldiers panicked and ran toward the off-road vehicles next to them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Someone started the car immediately, and someone picked up the communicator to report the checkpoint rush to their superiors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, shrill sirens sounded, and several military off-road vehicles followed the BMW closely, but they could not catch up with it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was not just because the BMW's engine was powerful, but Rosalia's excellent driving skills also played an important role.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With her current strength, these ordinary soldiers' reactions were too slow, so they could not catch up with her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Loscity Hospital was just ahead, and there was a second road closure checkpoint.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosalia did the same thing and rushed forward, and the car body and glass were hit by at least hundreds of bullets.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although spots appeared, no bullet could penetrate the car body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the blink of an eye, the number of vehicles chasing behind had increased to more than ten, half of which were police cars and half were military off-road vehicles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the gate of Loscity Hospital, Rosalia stepped on the brakes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amid the harsh sound of brakes, the BMW performed a beautiful tail-swing drift.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The tires rubbed against the ground so violently that a pungent burning smell was produced.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as the BMW stopped, dozens of soldiers rushed up with dozens of guns pointed at the BMW.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Among them were grenade launchers, sniper rifles, and even anti-tank rocket launchers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The car door slowly opened, and Alexander got out of the car calmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, some soldiers shouted angrily, "Don't move! Put your hands up, hold your head, and squat down!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was a sound of gun safety being opened, filled with murderous intent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Rosalia in the car changed her expression. If she were faced with such a situation, she would really be helpless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was not strong enough to ignore the group attack of dozens of armed soldiers, not to mention that they had a lot of heavy weapons.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander showed no fear at all. He patted his suit lightly and said calmly, "Get out of the way!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These extremely ordinary words contained a terrifying aura of being superior and looking down on everything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The soldiers surrounding him felt a chill on their backs, and their hands holding their guns began to tremble inexplicably.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was like a group of vicious wolves encountering a ferocious tiger. It was the crushing momentum of the superior, and Alexander was this superior.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The leading officer, Ambrose Atkins, couldn't help but roar, "Don't move, put your hands up, or we'll shoot!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His forehead was covered with fine beads of sweat. The young man in front of him brought him heavy mental pressure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander took the last puff of his cigarette and exhaled a long smoke ring.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let me in. I have a special medicine that can eliminate the plague."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His tone was very calm and natural as if everything was so natural.</span></p><div class="pagination">
