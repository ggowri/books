  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Not long, maybe ten minutes tops... can't compare to you, Boss," Betty recalled with a playful smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can go for at least an hour," Alexander joked, grinning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Betty's curiosity was piqued. "Boss, how do you last so long? Do you have a secret?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander laughed heartily. "No secrets, just practice."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Betty felt increasingly intrigued. "Boss, I can't hold back anymore..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Betty, you're getting bold. I like that," Alexander said, moving closer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The desk shook under their intensity, and Betty's voice filled the room, a blend of pain and pleasure. After a while, Betty was exhausted, limp and murmuring faintly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander finally let out a satisfied sigh, his muscles relaxing. Betty clung to the desk, her body trembling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Boss, you're incredible," she said, helping Alexander clean up, her eyes full of admiration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander enjoyed the moment, appreciating how well she understood him. Once they were done, Betty nestled into his arms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"An hour and ten minutes. You're amazing, Boss. Being with you is the best," she said playfully, reaching for him again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh! I just wanted to see how long it was, but here we go again... I can't, I need to recover first," she said, wide-eyed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander teased her gently. "If you're not ready, don't move. Don't blame me if you're too tired to walk."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Betty looked at him with pleading eyes. "Do you think I'd really try again? I just can't resist touching you. If we do, I'll need two days to recover."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She leaned in for a few kisses, her lips glistening enticingly. Alexander lingered for a </span><span>moment before gently pushing her away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Betty, our magic powder and beauty balm are key to the Ultimate Alliance. Keep them safe."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry, Boss. Anyone who wants them will have to get through me first," Betty promised seriously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Half an hour later, Alexander saw Betty off to her car. She clung to him, reluctant to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's late. You should head back," Alexander said, giving her a light pat on the hip.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Betty reluctantly </span><span>drove</span><span> away. Back in his study, Alexander felt refreshed and energized. His time with Betty and absorbing some of James' Force made it a perfect time to practice his </span><span>Spellweave</span><span> Pattern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He took out his engraving knife and gemstone, focusing intently on the task. The knife moved over the gemstone like a serpent winding along.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without realizing it, Alexander completed his hundredth </span><span>Spellweave</span><span> Pattern, surpassing his previous attempt of just over ninety. If he could complete all 108 Patterns, he could inscribe a magic array on the rare yellow gemstone, finishing the core for his lightsaber.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Phew!" Alexander exhaled, thrilled with his progress. Unfortunately, his Force was depleted. He glanced at the doorway, sensing a familiar presence. His All-seeing Eyes had already spotted her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Rosalia, back again. He opened the door and found her kneeling. She quickly bowed when she saw him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Go wait for me inside. I'm going to take a shower," Alexander said, gesturing with his hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, master!" Rosalia replied sweetly, bowing deeply.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing her call him "master" sent a shiver down his spine. She truly knew how to capture a man's heart.</span></p><div class="pagination">
