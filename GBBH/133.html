  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was smiling, but the murderous intent in his eyes made Jackson shiver in terror.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You can't kill me... I've already paid you ten million!" Jackson yelled, turning to run.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Where do you think you're going?" Alexander kicked him in the leg.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a scream, Jackson clutched his shin and rolled on the ground in agony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Please, don't kill me. I swear I won't tell anyone. Please, I have a wife and kids at home..." Jackson started pleading pitifully, sniveling and crying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Alexander, after everything he'd been through, was no longer that soft-hearted, naive man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your real name is Joshua Gellar. You're on police record for dozens of fraud cases.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Five years ago, you scammed a businessman named Gerard, causing his bankruptcy. Gerard went mad, killed his wife and daughter, and then committed suicide.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Three years ago, you tricked a widow in Oslo with promises of a cure, delaying her only child's treatment. Her child, barely two years old, died.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You haven't killed anyone directly, but over twenty people have died because of you. Do you really think you deserve to live?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shocked and horrified, Joshua stammered, "How... how did you find all that out?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander picked up the gun from the ground, shoved it into Joshua's hand, then aimed it at his mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Mmph</span><span>, no, don't!" Joshua struggled desperately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bang!" The gun fired, a bullet to the head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The body twitched a few times on the floor, eventually growing stiff in the pool of blood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under the power of the Force, Joshua's corpse quickly caught fire, engulfed in flames.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before leaving, Alexander pressed a spot on the woman's neck again and quickly left the room before she could wake.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, the woman's desperate cries for help echoed through the motel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander didn't drive home but went directly to a bar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wanted to see who was following him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Whiskey, please." Alexander ordered a drink, sipping slowly as he glanced outside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sure enough, the car following him parked by the bar entrance, and a beautiful woman stepped out, her curvy figure tightly wrapped in a black sexy pencil skirt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lara</span><span>!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander frowned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lara</span><span> strutted inside on high heels, exuding charm with her slender waist and swaying hips, drawing many admiring glances.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Scanning the room, she spotted Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their eyes met, and </span><span>Lara</span><span> smiled, then sat down beside Alexander under the envious eyes of the other men.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lara</span><span> had clearly dressed up, looking both seductive and alluring.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Especially that ample cleavage, impossible to ignore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander remained unfazed. He had never liked </span><span>Lara</span><span>, who always looked down on him and often gossiped about him to Ava.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If she came looking for him, she surely had an agenda.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Alexander's indifferent face, </span><span>Lara</span><span> felt a little awkward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had thought long and hard before deciding to approach Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lara</span><span> admitted she had misjudged him. Before, Alexander had just been a freeloader with decent combat skills at most.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But at the conference, he revealed himself as the developer of the magic powder, completely shattering her perception of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aren't you going to buy me a drink?" </span><span>Lara</span><span> asked coyly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander didn't respond but signaled the server.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing this, </span><span>Lara</span><span> smiled, feeling satisfied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If she could win Alexander's support, she could truly control the Hansen family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Right now, she was only the nominal heir, with all power resting in Orion's hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If this continued, </span><span>Lara</span><span> knew her position would eventually be at risk.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Men love beautiful women, and </span><span>Lara</span><span> was certain Alexander was no different.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Especially a woman like her, with looks, figure, and a family background, equal to Ava in every way. Surely, he'd be interested.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lara</span><span> believed firmly that powerful men have an instinctual urge to claim more women. </span><span>It's just animal nature.</span></p><div class="pagination">
