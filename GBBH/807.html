  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"It's freezing. Damn it. This weather changes without warning," a Dragon Gang member said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"It's so cold. And we have no thick jackets. Just hope it doesn't rain," muttered another man from the Dragon Gang. They shivered as they dropped their tools and scrambled into their tents.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The unlucky ones left outside chattered their teeth before giving up and heading for shelter, too.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Casper looked displeased.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Kermit tried to console him. "Strong winds have their upside, at least. The folks on Treasure Island won't be able to set sail."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Aidan, who had recently arrived, chuckled, "Brothers, no need to worry. Let's warm up by the fire. According to the forecast, there's no storm today, so this wind won't last much longer."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Casper nodded. "Glad you made it on time with advanced combat armor, Aidan. Now, we have nothing to fear."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Kermit's excitement was evident as he nodded vigorously. "Exactly. I never thought Boss would entrust us with only three sets of combat armor. With these, even if Treasure Island attacks, we can easily beat them."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Let's warm up and eat something. This nasty weather won't last long," Casper declared, leading his brothers into the largest tent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Inside the tent, three mechanical armors shimmered with a metallic sheen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Developed by the Risun military, the armor, while less powerful than Alexander's, was still a step beyond traditional combat exoskeletons.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It had taken the Dragon Gang's vast wealth and connections to acquire even three.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the era of cold weapons, a soldier in iron armor could resist arrows and swords with ease.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Now, the modern armor surpassed those ancient defenses, equipped with formidable offensive power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When worn by a metahuman with firearm power, these suits could unleash devastating combat prowess.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What beauties they are!" Casper admired the armor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Their dark alloy surfaces were gleaming. They came with rapid-fire mini-guns, shields, and combat blades forged from special steel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When donned by a metahuman with firearm power, one of these suits packed enough firepower to match an entire platoon's assault.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was no wonder even the Dragon Gang could only secure three.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They were the ace up their boss's sleeve, her assurance in purchasing Devil Island, with no fear of Treasure Island's retaliation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander's situation was far more favorable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His team hid in the thick forest, right at the heart of the magic circle, where the winds were significantly weakened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Those bastards must be frozen!" Augusta muttered with glee.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marvin asked, "Boss, should we strike now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander ignored him, observing the Dragon Gang's makeshift camp.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Almost everyone had retreated to the tents, while a few chopped branches to start fires.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>There were no sentries, and no one seemed to be watching the forest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He didn't intend to give them much time; by tonight, he would eliminate these unwelcome guests.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Rouse the troops!" Alexander finally ordered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>One by one, people were nudged awake, spreading the word in silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even with a thousand elite soldiers assembling, not a sound was heard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before long, everyone was ready, awaiting Alexander's command.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander showed no sign of haste. He would lead the charge himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Turning, he surveyed his troops, pleased to see their intense focus and fierce eagerness for the upcoming battle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Buddies, after victory, there'll be a one-thousand-dollar reward for each of you." His promise lit a fire among them, filling the air with excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'll go in first. Attack five minutes after I make my move," Alexander added.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He then strode toward the Dragon Gang's camp.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Boss, are you really going in alone? Should I come with you?" Marvin asked, concerned but excited.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The enemy had over a thousand armed men, after all.</span></p><div class="pagination">
