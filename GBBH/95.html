  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Sebastian's face paled, and his body trembled uncontrollably.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander's piercing gaze seemed to penetrate his thoughts, leaving him feeling exposed and vulnerable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I dare not stall, Mr. Hawthorne. I'm truly in awe of your powers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Please, just spare me and my son. I beg of you, Mr. Hawthorne.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Here are the last few locations Guzman visited. I'll send them to you immediately. If I get any concrete information about him, I'll report it right away," Sebastian said, forcing himself to speak.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander grunted, a hint of a smile on his face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Fine, I'll spare you this time, considering your cooperation. As for your son, we'll see about that after we find Guzman."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With that, he pressed a palm to Sebastian's forehead.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The Force, which had been lurking and causing turmoil within Sebastian's mind, instantly calmed down.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Sebastian felt a wave of relief wash over him as the previous agonizing pain vanished into thin air.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I... I'm really healed? It's miraculous!" Sebastian exclaimed, his voice filled with excitement.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He stood up abruptly and shook his head vigorously, marveling at the absence of pain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Before, even the slightest movement had caused him excruciating headaches.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Sebastian, I've only temporarily eased your pain. If we don't find Guzman within ten days, you'll suffer double the agony. I mean what I say," Alexander warned, his tone icy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Sebastian shuddered at the thought, realizing that double the pain would be unbearable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His excitement and relief were instantly quenched by the realization that he only had ten days.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mr. Hawthorne, please rest assured. I will do everything in my power to find Guzman. I will cooperate fully..." Sebastian assured, bowing and scraping to Alexander like a servant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander dismissed him with a wave of his hand and turned to leave.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He sent the locations Sebastian had provided to Anne, instructing her to have them checked out carefully.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As soon as Alexander was out of sight, Sebastian's smile vanished, replaced by a look of pure malice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Damn you, Alexander. You think you're so smart? Just wait until the black robe wizard arrives. I'll make you pay!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just then, one of his men came rushing in.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mr. Sebastian Tate, big news. There's been a change in the magic powder control. Billy has disappeared, and now Betty, who's been missing for a while, is in charge of magic powder sales.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Moreover, Betty has publicly announced that she will hold a magic powder exchange meeting in three days to determine the various sales agents for magic powder."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Sebastian was taken aback.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What! Betty, that traitor. There must be someone behind her!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Whether they could obtain the magic powder formula during this trip to Loscity would determine the future of the Brilliant Group.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Putting Alexander's matter aside for the moment, he immediately called Guzman to report the situation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After a half-hour phone call, Sebastian hung up with a very unsightly expression.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Guzman had given two clear orders.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">First, Alexander must die.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Second, they must obtain the magic powder formula.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Sebastian immediately issued orders. "Find Betty at all costs. I need to see her."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Then, he returned to the hospital to visit his son, Theodore.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Dad, are you just going to let Alexander go?" Theodore asked, a hint of unwillingness in his voice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Sebastian sneered, his face darkening.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"How could I just let him go? But I'm cursed, so I have to make some concessions. Once your uncle's black robe wizard arrives in Loscity, that brat will be finished.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Don't worry, he doesn't have long to strut about."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Theodore nodded vigorously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"He must suffer beyond imagination. We need to make it clear that crossing us means a death sentence."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Sebastian's agreement was palpable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"A mere Alexander, even with his bit of dark magic, is hardly a major threat. Our real enemy now is the magic powder and those who control it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Alexander's demise is a given, and the magic powder will be ours."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His eyes gleamed with ruthless determination.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">*****</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The Nightfall Bar, once the headquarters of the Wolf Gang, had now been taken over by Betty. The Wolf Gang had been rebranded as the Ultimate Alliance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Billy's former followers had surrendered, eager to fall in line with Betty's new regime.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">During this period, the Nightfall Bar had become a bustling hub, teeming with activity. The place was a magnet for high-profile figures seeking to secure magic powder distribution rights.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With Billy's disappearance, these influential figures naturally turned their attention to Betty, eager to negotiate deals and take advantage of the power vacuum.</p><div class="pagination">
