  <div class="container"><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Mr. Merrett...&quot; Joaquin hesitated, confused.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Stephen immediately cut him off. &quot;I&#x27;m in the mood to deal with these fools today. Let&#x27;s make sure we do this right. I&#x27;ll use their heads to honor Tyler and the others.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Stephen&#x27;s eyes were ice cold as he glanced at Brock and his men.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Brock, usually brimming with confidence, suddenly felt a chill down his spine. His heart raced, and he stopped dead in his tracks.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Brianna, pressed close to him, gave him a little nudge and asked with a sweet, flirtatious voice, &quot;What&#x27;s wrong, baby? You look distracted.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Nothing, let&#x27;s go,&quot; Brock muttered, shaking it off.</p><p style="text-align:left;">He gave Brianna a playful squeeze on her chest, then signaled for his men to follow him inside, still trying to act unbothered.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Despite his reputation in Louvian and his solid fighting skills, Brock had no idea who he was up against.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Stephen was a monster, literally. As the top dog of Sakra Society and enhanced by enhancement drugs, he was on a whole different level, something close to a level-five metahuman.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Brock&#x27;s cockiness would get him nowhere here.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Shut the door. No one leaves,&quot; Stephen ordered, his voice low and threatening.</p><p style="text-align:left;">His gaze was like a predator&#x27;s, cold and calculating. The twisted smile on his face would send shivers down anyone&#x27;s spine.</p><p style="text-align:left;">The doors slammed shut.</p><p style="text-align:left;">In a heartbeat, screams echoed through the restaurant, desperate cries rising up.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Within less than a minute, the floor was covered in bodies, blood spilling everywhere, like something straight out of hell.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Brock, known as the &quot;Undying Bird&quot; in Louvian, and his four most loyal men had always been a formidable force.</p><p style="text-align:left;">They trained together relentlessly, perfecting a synchronized fighting style that made them almost unbeatable.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Brock himself was a force to be reckoned with. After five years of rigorous training at a dojo, he had become an expert.</p><p style="text-align:left;">His reputation was built on his fearlessness and raw fighting ability. He was known for never backing down, no matter the odds.</p><p style="text-align:left;">But now, in this small restaurant, Brock and his men found themselves trapped, powerless against an enemy far stronger than they had anticipated.</p><p style="text-align:left;">The five of them, plus Brianna, were the only ones still alive.</p><p style="text-align:left;">The others had been slaughtered, their bodies hacked to pieces and scattered around.</p><p style="text-align:left;">It was brutal, their dead eyes wide open, filled with terror and disbelief, forever frozen in their last moments.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Brock and his four subordinates were panting, their hands trembling as they gripped their machetes.</p><p style="text-align:left;">The fear was palpable. They no longer had any of their usual swagger. They were pale, sweat dripping, their weapons slipping from their hands.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Stephen, on the other hand, was all business. He moved like a blade, cold, sharp, and unstoppable.</p><p style="text-align:left;">His belt held two sabers, one of which was already drawn, slightly longer than the other.</p><p style="text-align:left;">The blade gleamed with a stark white sheen, streaked with fresh blood that stained the metal red. Intricate spiral patterns resembling chrysanthemums spiraled along the edge of the blade.</p><p style="text-align:left;">These delicate, swirling engravings were the mark of a master blade-forger, crafted only by the most skilled artisans through years of painstaking refinement.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Stephen&#x27;s saber wasn&#x27;t just any weapon. It was a true treasure, a weapon of rare and unmatched quality.</p><p style="text-align:left;">The sound of blood dripping from the edge of the blade was almost soothing, the only noise in the room besides the groans of the dying.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Brianna was huddled in a corner, clutching her head, too terrified to even look up.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Joaquin&#x27;s men, however, watched from the sidelines, grinning, eager for the spectacle to unfold.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Stephen, calm and lethal, took a slow step forward, his saber held loosely in his hand. His eyes locked on Brock with a twisted smile, no mercy in sight.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Brock and his men slowly backed away, sweat soaking their shirts. The machetes in their hands felt like dead weight.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;You want to finish us off? It&#x27;s just a small fight! You&#x27;ve already killed more than ten people, and now, you want to wipe us all out?&quot; Brock growled, baring his teeth.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;You took my deposit! You promised me this place! You&#x27;re going back on your word. What kind of business is this?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Stephen&#x27;s laugh was dark and mocking as he ran his tongue along the bloodstained edge of his saber, savoring the moment like a predator about to make the kill.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Weren&#x27;t you all tough a minute ago? Too scared now? Well, guess what? It&#x27;s too late.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">With a sudden, fluid motion, the blade was pointing straight at Brock, and the tension in the room was suffocating.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;You guys think you&#x27;re worthy to feast on our food? Only we, the noblest people, deserve that privilege.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Stephen&#x27;s disgust was clear, his eyes cold as he looked at Brock and his gang.</p><div class="pagination">
