  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a flash, those burly men screamed in agony, either falling to the ground, unable to get up, or being knocked out directly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Within seconds, Alexander effortlessly knocked all of them to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you still not willing to apologize to me? Do you really want to save your father or not?" Alexander turned his head to look at the stunned Maxine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, I'm sorry!" Maxine came to her senses and begged him, "Please save my father. We don't want one hundred million dollars. Just save him, and we can give you the technology for free."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her feelings at this moment were beyond description. She hadn't expected a random guy she resorted to to be such a good fighter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxine took a close look at Alexander and suddenly felt that he was incredibly handsome, like a charming prince sent from the heavens.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander reached out and pinched Maxine's chin, smiling, "Good. So, let's make it clear&mdash;I'll help you save your father, and then the bulletproof technology will be mine free of charge."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay, I promise to fulfill all your wishes as far as I can!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxine nodded and suddenly blushed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, Alexander turned his head to look at Husk, who looked extremely frightened at this very moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He never would have thought that Maxine actually found such a powerful man who easily took down all of his subordinates.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Brat, you actually dared to lay a hand on us? We're from Silver Shield Security, you're screwed! Our boss won't let this go!" Husk threatened Alexander, though he sounded somewhat uncertain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander shrugged indifferently with disdain on his face. "I heard your chairman is named Jordan, right? Unfortunately, no matter how powerful Silver Shield Security is in Newbrook, it means nothing here in Loscity."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fool, the Silver Shield Security has another major shareholder, who is also a high-ranking leader in the Mafia. You're doomed now, and the only way you can save your ass is by taking Maxine to me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as he mentioned the Mafia having a stake in Silver Shield Security, Husk immediately became more confident.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander shook his head disdainfully. "I've already taken out all of the Mafia's strongholds in Loscity. How dare you bring up the Mafia now? Don't you know they are our Ultimate Alliance's arch-enemies?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Husk's eyes widened in shock, and he took two steps back, stammering, "Y-You're from the Ultimate Alliance?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>What</span><span>? Don't I look </span><span>like a member of the </span><span>Ultimate Alliance?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander had grown impatient, </span><span>and he directly hit </span><span>Husk with a slap that knocked him unconscious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These losers weren't even worth his time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxine looked up at Alexander with tearful eyes, then suddenly threw herself into his arms, hugging him tightly as she cried, "You're from the Ultimate Alliance? Why didn't you say it </span><span>earlier</span><span>? Please, please save my dad. I beg you..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander felt Maxine's </span><span>big boobs</span><span> press tightly against his chest. The soft and elastic touch was incredibly pleasant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get your luggage ready first. I'll take you to a safe place." He patted Maxine's round butt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxine blushed and let out a soft moan, casting Alexander a shy glare before quickly running into the room to pack her things.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, Alexander made a call to Betty, telling her to send someone over to clean up the mess here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, Maxine emerged from the room with a large suitcase behind her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aren't you supposed to be a gentleman and help me with the suitcase?" Maxine struggled to keep up with Alexander as she trotted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander just smiled and got into the car without responding to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey! You even touched my butt, so why don't you even help me with my suitcase?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxine huffed and threw the suitcase into the trunk of the car, then jogged to the passenger seat with a glare at Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander paused for a moment, then replied, "I'll take you to a safe place first. Tomorrow, I'll go with you to Newbrook to rescue your father."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxine fell silent. Tears welled up in her eyes, and she sincerely thanked Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander dropped Maxine off at the Ultimate Alliance headquarters and assigned four bodyguards to her. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, he walked into Betty's office alone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxine watched in a daze as Alexander disappeared around the corridor corner</span><span>, </span><span>and</span><span> she</span><span> suddenly felt so empty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One of the bodyguards respectfully reminded her, "Ms. Duncan, please come with us to your room."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxine came to her senses and asked curiously, "What</span><span>'s </span><span>Mr. Hawthorne </span><span>position</span><span> at Ultimate Alliance?"</span></p><div class="pagination">
