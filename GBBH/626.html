  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was a young man standing next to him. He was about thirty years old, wearing a black designer suit. He narrowed his eyes with a cold and angry expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan was so frightened that he trembled violently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Godfather, this is not my fault. This is a trap that was set long ago. Olivia is related to Ultimate Alliance. Alexander brought hundreds of people here and took away the exchange."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan started wailing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The young man leaned over to Godfather Brandon Hawkins and whispered, "Godfather, Alexander has indeed returned to Loscity. Felix is now missing, and we don't know whether he is dead or alive."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brandon showed a murderous look in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before the young man could finish his words, Brandon grabbed the cup and slammed it in front of Evan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan was so frightened that he begged for mercy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Godfather, this is not my fault. Alexander is too arrogant. He said that if Mafia members go to Loscity, he will kill them."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shut up!" The young man turned around and shouted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan quickly covered his mouth with his hands and trembled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How long will it take to find out whether Felix is dead or alive?" Brandon said with cold eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lowering his head, the young man shuddered and said, "I only found out that the downfall of the Morris family was related to Alexander, and Felix disappeared. It will take a few more days to confirm whether Felix is dead or alive..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brandon slammed the table.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Flame, you are the top killer of Mafia. You can even compete with Shadow. Can you be more reliable?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you can't even find any information about Felix, how can I expect you to kill </span><span>Shadow and that old man?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The young man named "Flame" lowered his head and said nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The room was silent, and Evan was trembling. He was afraid that Brandon would vent his anger on him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brandon's expression looked very ugly, and the killing intent in his eyes became stronger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander has offended me many times. Apart from that old man, I have never suffered so much.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ultimate Alliance is the largest force in Loscity? Well. I want to see how strong it is. If I want them to die, they will die."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A malicious aura filled the room, causing both Flame and Evan to shudder with fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brandon was notoriously cruel. He would kill someone's whole family with no mercy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, Brandon calmed down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Flame, first, you have to find out where Felix is. Second, kill Shadow and that old man as soon as possible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I will send someone to deal with Alexander. I will make him suffer!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, Godfather." Flame bowed his head respectfully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan immediately breathed a sigh of relief, thinking his life was saved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the next second, he felt a murderous gaze staring at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brandon waved his hand and said, "Drag him out and feed him to the dogs."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan screamed in fear, and before he could even beg for mercy, Flame grabbed his neck and dragged him out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, you, Shadow, and that old man will all die."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a murderous look in Brandon's eyes, he calmly took out his cell phone and dialed a number.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Karl, go tell Bruno that as long as he can kill Alexander, I will acknowledge that he has my blood, and his mother's ashes can be buried in our family cemetery."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the other end of the phone, Karl exclaimed, "Godfather, are you serious?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Karl tried his best to persuade him. "Do you want to accept Bruno? He might be the son of that woman and another man. At that time, you said that his mother would never be buried in the family cemetery. How could you..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shut up!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Karl was interrupted.</span></p><div class="pagination">
