  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander stared at the short figure in mid-air, his heart pounding with a sense of extreme oppression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sweat was streaming down his forehead. He wondered if he could withstand a single blow from that man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Frieza laughed, "You've got quite a nerve!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Enoch, with naked upper body, disheveled hair, and bloodstained chest, held a spear. A faint golden light flickered under his feet as he leaped to Alexander's side.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hogan's refined iron armor was broke. He had blood at the corner of his mouth. Seeing this, he held a broadsword and closely followed Enoch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander looked solemn. Without saying a word, he wiped the sweat from the corner of his eye, stood firmly, and tightly clenched his fists. The fighting spirit in his chest was burning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "Come on! Let me see if you're really Frieza Mank!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In mid-air, Frieza shook his head and glanced at the three of them with his strange, narrow pupils. His cold voice sounded. "Which one of you should I send to hell first?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Frieza suddenly started at Hogan, who looked slightly weak. A fierce look flashed in his narrow eyes. "It's you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander frowned and shouted, "No!" However, before he could react, Frieza's right index finger pointed at Hogan. Soon, a shrill, explosive sound rang out, and a mug-thick dazzling scarlet light-column shot out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, the light penetrated Hogan's left chest and disappeared into the ground, leaving a bottomless hole.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hogan's face turned ashen. Blood spurted from his left chest. With a clang, the broadsword fell to the ground. He didn't even grunt and slumped down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How dare you!" Tears welled up in Enoch's eyes. His chest heaved violently. He stomped his foot, and a surge of golden protective energy burst out. He soared into the air and waved the spear in his hand. The air exploded. The spear blasted straight towards Frieza's chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Hogan fall, Alexander was furious. He roared, and the muscles all over his body bulged.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The explosive sound filled the air. Two bucket-thick dazzling light columns burst out from his palms in an instant, shooting toward Frieza like a streak of lightning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Energy Plot Attack passed Enoch and hit Frieza's head. With a bang, a dazzling light explosion shot up into the sky, and clouds of dust billowed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Immediately afterwards, a huge and dazzling golden spear blasted into the smoke and dust. Only the snapping sound could be heard, and soon, there was silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was stern. The extremely powerful internal energy didn't hurt Frieza at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When the dust cleared, Frieza was pinching Enoch's neck with one hand and grabbing a spear with the other. Enoch's body hung limply. His neck was probably broken, and he died.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Frieza let out a sinister laugh. Suddenly, he raised his hands. Enoch and the spear shot towards Alexander like thunderbolts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander exhaled and let out a shout. His whole body was wrapped in silver-white internal energy. He suddenly appeared above Frieza's head like a dazzling meteor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Seismic Cleave!" Alexander howled. His muscles swelled, and the sounds of wind and thunder filled the air. Dazzling blue palm strikes crashed toward Frieza like stormy waves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Frieza sneered. He neither dodged nor evaded. All the palm strikes instantly hit Frieza's whole body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were a series of bangs, but Frieza didn't move an inch. Alexander's face turned livid. He knew he couldn't defeat Frieza by force, but he couldn't let him catch up with the Hrodvik army. Alexander suddenly retracted his palms. A blue-silver air wave spurted from his feet, and he shot towards the north of the camp like a meteor streaking across the sky.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Humph, you want to escape?" Frieza narrowed his eyes and clenched his fists. A column of scarlet flames shot up from his feet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, he caught up and surpassed Alexander. The next second, he kicked Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a deafening bang, Alexander was slammed into a stone wall several miles away, creating a huge deep pit. He was embedded in the wall, hanging limply.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dozens of miles away from the camp, in mid-air, Frieza stood with his hands behind his back, laughing strangely, "Stop pretending. Show me all your strength. If you're really scared, surrender to me. Galo's position will be yours!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was shocked, thinking, "Is the man really Frieza?" His expression changed. He moved his arms, and his body shot out of the deep pit. A silver-white flame spurted from his feet, and like a dazzling comet, he continued to flee towards the north.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He knew very well that he couldn't fight Frieza head-on.</span></p><div class="pagination">
