  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I really can't go on anymore..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hold on, for the sake of your future happiness, you can endure a little longer!" Lynn murmured encouragement, then gave a firm push.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava immediately felt like she exploded and could no longer control her body. The nerves that had been tightly wound suddenly relaxed, completely releasing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because the suppression had lasted for so long, her entire body trembled uncontrollably, and her consciousness sank into a semi-conscious state, overwhelmed by an unprecedented wave of excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a soft moan, Ava released her grip on Lynn's neck. Her rigid body finally relaxed, her face flushed with heat, and she couldn't stop gasping for breath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lynn pulled out her fingers, took them into her lips, and licked them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tsk, tsk, it's sweet. No wonder Alex likes you so much."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Um... What are you talking about? Just stop talking, it's embarrassing..." Ava blushed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Lynn said these words, her mind was filled with thoughts of Alexander. She couldn't help but feel a surge of emotion as if countless ants were crawling inside her body. She could no longer hold back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She held up her breasts and brought them to Ava's mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come on, baby, bite me. I can't stand it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava obediently did as she said. It tasted sweet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Um..." Although there was nothing, she still sucked eagerly, savoring every moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lynn had a look of sheer bliss on her face as she knelt atop her waist, pushing her chest forward as much as she could. Her left hand went deep between her legs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava used one hand to touch herself and the other kneading Lynn, comparing their breasts together. They were soft, heavy, and pretty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're a bad girl."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lynn and Ava were entangled for a long while.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their movements suddenly came to a halt, frozen in place, and even the sound seemed to disappear as if time itself had stopped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had partied at the villa for most of the day.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The three women were so worn out by Alexander that they couldn't even get out of bed and could only lie together.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander, on the other hand, felt refreshed, with the Force within him more abundant than ever before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He drove away from Rebecca's house and was passing through a street when, suddenly, he heard a commotion coming from around the corner ahead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander immediately recognized her. She was his college classmate, Alin Eden.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had last seen her at a class reunion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that time, she had not looked down on him, so his impression of her was still fairly good.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To his surprise, here she was, arguing with someone. Alexander decided to walk over and see what was going on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Please, don't do this! I beg you, spare me. I swear I can raise the two million dollars. Please, save my son!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you don't change my son's kidney, he'll be in danger! He's only eight years old, please, have mercy..." Alin was begging a middle-aged man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man sneered and slapped Alin, knocking her to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why should I care if your son lives or dies? If you want a kidney, you need to pay for it. Two million dollars per kidney, not a cent less.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If it weren't for the fact that you've been with me for a few nights, I'd have already sold it to someone else. If you can't gather two million dollars today, I'll sell it to someone else."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Edith, please, please do a good deed. Give my son the kidney transplant first. I'll do anything. Just save him!" Alin bowed deeply, clutching the man's leg, pleading.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander had been listening to their conversation from a distance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is this guy selling organs?" he thought, his heart burning with anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man, Carl Edith, narrowed his eyes, looking at Alin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her body was curvaceous, and since she was bowing, her figure was accentuated, giving off a mature woman's allure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Heh, if you sleep with me for a few more days, I can help you find another kidney..." Carl felt himself burning with lust.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Edith, I'll do whatever you want. Just save my son. Please!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alin had completely disregarded her own body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As long as you're obedient, everything can be arranged."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A trace of subtle mockery flashed across Carl's expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Money and women, he would always choose money. However, Alin could be played with for his amusement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come on, let's go to a hotel. For your son's sake, if you serve me well, I can help </span><span>you."</span></p><div class="pagination">
