  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The genius of this Mafia family possessed the terrifying combat strength of a wild beast, yet still, he was no match for Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your defeat is sealed. Do you still intend to resist futilely?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander gazed at him with indifference.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bruno spat out a mouthful of blood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He glared at Alexander, his chest burning with raging battle intent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I will kill you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Like a cornered beast with no way out, Bruno lunged at Alexander with ferocity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander couldn't help but marvel at Bruno's sheer might; he was indeed extraordinary by birth, but alas, it was all in vain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bruno collided with an invisible wall of the Force and couldn't get any closer to Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander slapped Bruno hard across the face, sending him flying more than twenty feet away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bruno lay on the ground, his cheek swollen and discolored, spitting out blood mixed with several teeth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You dare to slap me? Alexander, you shall die..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bruno was trembling with rage. This was an unspeakable humiliation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you still refuse to yield?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander tilted his head slightly, his eyes filled with disdain and arrogance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've spared you twice out of consideration for the fact that you didn't ambush Ava. If you continue to be ungrateful, don't blame me for ending you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His cold tone, laced with murderous intent, seemed to lower the temperature around them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bruno panted heavily, propping himself up with one hand, his chest heaving.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gradually, his grotesque and vicious expression disappeared, replaced by a strange calm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Neither the bloodied stump of his arm nor the throbbing pain in his cheek affected him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bruno stared at Alexander and suddenly grinned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You don't deserve Ava. You're garbage who deceives women's feelings. Don't think you've won! I've lived in the jungle for over twenty years, living a primitive life. Every time I faced danger, I came out unscathed. Countless beasts have fallen to my hands."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, he tore off his tattered clothes, revealing dozens of terrifying scars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Look at this. A brown bear left this one. Its swipe almost spilled my intestines."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bruno pointed to several twisted, centipede-like ugly scars on his stomach.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In the end, that brown bear became my sustenance for the winter. The taste of roasted bear paws was quite delightful."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He reminisced with a chuckle, then pointed to two round pits on his chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That was from a wild boar weighing over four hundred pounds. Its tusks were indeed formidable, almost impaling me. In the end, I cured it with rock salt and firewood, turning it into delicious smoked meat that could be stored for a long time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Another time, I was swallowed by a giant python... You'll never know what that feels like... The dark, enclosed passage, the corrosive acid of the python's stomach... That time was really dangerous. I felt like I was going to die...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In the end, I still managed to cut open its belly with a dagger, watching it roll and convulse on the ground. It took a full two hours for it to die completely."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bruno took great interest in introducing the scars on his body, his cold gaze fixed on Alexander all the while.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you think you've won now? Alexander, I warn you. Our battle has only just begun!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't seek anything from Brandon, but to fulfill my mother's wish, I'm willing to pay any price. You're just a stumbling block on my path to success. I will crush you bit by bit!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Bruno's aura suddenly intensified like an insurmountable mountain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander clapped his hands with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Very well. I didn't expect your will to be so strong, to rise in adversity. No wonder you dared to come to kill me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander laughed heartily, with a hint of regret.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What a pity. You have a wish to fulfill, and I have something to protect. Perhaps we are the same kind of people, but by some twist of fate, you are destined to die.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Not only will you die, but Brandon will die too. The position of the Mafia Godfather is mine!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's resolute words caused Bruno's face to change. He didn't expect Alexander to have such ambition, even wanting to annex the Mafia.</span></p><div class="pagination">
