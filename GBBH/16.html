  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Andrew scoffed dismissively.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Ashley, you're overthinking it. Even if Alexander has some abilities, Ryan is about to become the vice president of the Saint Group.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"With the Reaper, that Godfather behind the Saint Group, someone like Alexander doesn't stand a chance."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jane hesitated for a moment before nodding firmly. "Yes, Dad, you're right."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She knew that the divorce was her mistake, that she had even abandoned Ashley.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">So when Alexander began to show strength and capability, Jane started to panic, feeling a twinge of regret and fear that Alexander might come after her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Andrew appeared confident and untroubled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Ashley, you need to do two things right now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"First, get Alexander to lift the Sorcery.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Second, the Fairfax and Hawkins families are newly risen nobles in Loscity. We must make Alexander pay up, or we'll lose face."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Andrew's encouragement instantly boosted Jane's confidence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Right, let's do that."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jane immediately grabbed her phone and called Alexander.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At that moment, Alexander had just arrived home. Seeing who was calling, he hung up, not wanting to answer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jane, unwilling to give up, called three more times before Alexander reluctantly picked up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As soon as the call connected, Jane's voice came through, filled with anger and threats.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Alexander, you need to lift the Sorcery on Mr. Hawkins immediately! You also need to compensate us for medical expenses, lost wages, emotional distress, and more, or the Saint Group won't let you off!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander was speechless. He thought, "How had I never noticed how foolish and arrogant she was before?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">I regret for seeing her as a muse. After the divorce, I finally saw everything clearly."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander responded coolly, "If you think the Saint Group will back you up, then let's see whose strength prevails."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Without waiting for Jane's response, Alexander hung up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jane was furious.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"That damn Alexander, daring to think he can match the Saint Group! He's completely delusional!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Andrew was equally enraged by Alexander's attitude.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Ashley, everyone knows Ryan is about to be the vice president of the Saint Group. There's no doubt someone will help us. Just get someone to drag Alexander here. I doubt he'll be so bold then!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jane swept the fruit bowl off the table, sending apples, grapes, and oranges rolling across the floor.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Fine! I'll make Alexander understand that he's nothing more than a rat in the gutter and that I made the right choice."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She grabbed her phone, sent a message, and then grinned wickedly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I've already contacted Billy Marrow, the leader of the Wolf Gang. He's agreed to help!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Alexander, you're about to pay for your arrogance."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Billy Marrow, the Wolf Gang leader, was notorious in the area and rumored to have ties with the infamous Blood Gang.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In Jane's eyes, Billy was ruthless and had a large group of followers. Alexander was no match for him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Meanwhile, Ava was anxiously gathering information.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Emma, is it true that the chairman wants Anne to send the first invitation to Ryan?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Emma nodded repeatedly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Ms. Blackburn, we can't afford to go against the chairman because of Alexander. I just received word that Alexander put Ryan in the hospital, which has something to do with Sorcery.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"That troublemaker Alexander is just a walking disaster, and Ms. Blackburn, you can't let him drag you down."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava pondered. She thought, "So, Alexander really did have some mysterious abilities."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Seeing Ava remain silent, Emma finally let out a sigh of relief. She thought, "As long as she didn't get involved with Alexander, everything would be fine."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Ms. Blackburn, you haven't chosen a dance partner for the ball yet. I've prepared a list of the most eligible bachelors from Loscity's elite families and corporations. You can choose any one of them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I think the mayor's son, Mr. Federer from the state council would be an excellent choice..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Emma enthusiastically introduced the candidates. If she were the president of the Saint Group, she would definitely choose one of them for a powerful alliance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava glanced at the list with an impassive expression.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Every name on it belonged to a prominent, unmarried figure.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I choose Alexander as my dance partner."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava suddenly declared.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Emma froze, her smile freezing on her face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Ms. Blackburn, Alexander and Ryan are sworn enemies now. Are you really going to oppose the chairman for someone like Alexander?"</p><div class="pagination">
