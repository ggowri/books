  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bullets carved graceful arcs through the air, knocking down target after target.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Many spectators held their breath, watching Ilona's performance with awe. Some even </span><span>wondered silently, "If I am facing her, how many shots will it take for her to bring me down?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, her firearm only held a little over twenty bullets. Yet, the digital screen showed her score already surpassing 300 points&mdash;which meant Ilona had hit 30 targets.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As more targets appeared, her gun should have been out of bullets. But strangely enough, she was still taking down targets.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ilona wasn't firing anymore. Instead, she extended her fingers, controlling the bullets she had already shot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One by one, the bullets danced through the air, piercing targets under her command.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"320 points!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"350 points!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"380 points!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"400 points..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The bullets moved like living, graceful sprites, whirling and circling endlessly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, the two-minute shooting time ended. Ilona finished with an astonishing 460 points.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd fell silent, awestruck by Ilona's terrifying mastery over firearms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Especially during the final moments, her ability to control dozens of bullets at intricate angles left everyone convinced they wouldn't stand a chance against her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Awesome! You're incredible, Ms. Cox!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're the best, Ms. Cox!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gael was beaming with excitement, clapping enthusiastically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ilona turned to Alexander, a teasing smile playing on her lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well? Are you going to admit defeat now, or do you want to challenge me?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you surrender now, out of respect for General Thompson, I'll let it slide. Just admit you were wrong and apologize."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's lips curled into a cold smirk.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You think you've won? I haven't even started yet. Honestly, you and Gael are about the same&mdash;both have a screw loose."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander tapped his temple mockingly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ilona's face turned pale with anger as she clenched her fists tightly, itching to teach Alexander a lesson.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander ignored her, picked up the gun, and fired without even bothering to aim.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"20 points!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His first shot was no ordinary one. The bullet, wrapped in the Force, demonstrated extraordinary flight capability and hit two targets at once.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The bullet didn't stop there&mdash;it continued toward another target.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander fired a second shot, and soon the second bullet joined in the hunt for the targets.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Ilona had started controlling bullets, she wasn't nearly as fluid as Alexander, nor had she used such powerful abilities from the beginning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander controlled the gun and bullets as if they were extensions of his body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bang! Bang! Bang!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander fired off all his bullets in quick succession.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone stared wide-eyed, dumbfounded, unsure of what Alexander was trying to do.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moments later, over twenty bullets began to whirl and dance around the target positions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every target that appeared was immediately taken down by the bullets.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"100 points!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"110 points!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"150 points!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His score skyrocketed. Each bullet moved with agile and unpredictable trajectories, like busy little bees, taking down every target no matter how many appeared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The targets were released automatically, and the faster they were hit, the quicker new ones appeared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"330 points!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"380 points!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"400 points!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In less than a minute, Alexander had already taken down 40 targets, and his pace was still accelerating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone was stunned, completely dumbfounded. Could it be that Alexander also had advanced firearm power?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brittany couldn't help but gasp, her beautiful eyes sparkling with delight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quentin trembled with excitement, clenching his fists just like many of the team members, his expression brimming with joy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gael, however, was completely floored. He now realized just how massive the gap between him and Alexander was&mdash;killing him would be as easy for Alexander as eating or drinking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Phew!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ilona took several deep breaths, barely managing to steady her trembling body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As someone with level-four firearm power, she knew that to perform at Alexander's level required at least level-five abilities, possibly level six or higher.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander had appeared completely at ease, clearly not even using his full power, while she had exerted herself to her absolute limit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By the end, she had nearly depleted all her internal energy, with sweat covering her palms and soles.</span><span> </span></p><div class="pagination">
