  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was just fuming about not getting closer to Ava, but now any desire he had vanished, replaced by an overwhelming anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anthony, you're such a coward! If you've got guts, come at me directly! Why resort to such vile methods?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Compared to Guzman, Alexander now wanted to deal with this second brother of his even more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately, even </span><span>Alice</span><span> knew little about Anthony. All she knew was that Anthony was an eccentric scientist, who controlled the multi-billion-dollar "Red Umbrella Group" from behind the scenes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Red Umbrella Group was a tech giant involved in biotech, defense products, and other advanced industries.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rumor had it that Red Umbrella Group had close ties with the government, working on many secret biochemical drugs and biological weapons projects.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander reviewed the information on Red Umbrella Group in his mind and soon arrived at the restaurant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He found the large dining hall floor covered with over a hundred people sprawled out, scattered everywhere.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were all wearing Saint Group uniforms, each in agonizing pain, curled up and convulsing, some even with blood at the corners of their mouths.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>About twenty medical personnel were already there but seemed completely helpless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava quickly asked the restaurant manager, "What's going on here, Ron?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Visibly shaken, Ron stammered, "The doctor... just said the drinks in the restaurant are poisoned, Ms. Blackburn. I swear I didn't know... it wasn't me..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Useless!" Ava pushed him aside and hurried over to the lead doctor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wait, it's you?" She was taken aback to find that it was Vincent, causing her to pause in surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vincent blushed with embarrassment, avoiding Alexander's gaze, and quickly began explaining the situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Based on our initial tests, it's a neurotoxin. While we've managed to stabilize some, over fifty are in critical condition, and their chances look grim.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Max grabbed Ron, scolding him. "Tell me the truth! Did you poison the drinks? Say it, </span><span>or I'll deal with you myself!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ron was on the verge of tears. "Mr. Blake, Ms. Blackburn... I swear I didn't do it. I've managed the company's restaurant for ten years. It couldn't have been me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava scolded. "Max, stop it. Ron likely had nothing to do with this. If he wanted to poison us, he'd have had plenty of chances before today."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmph! Even if it wasn't you, Ron, you're still responsible for poor management. We'll settle this once it's over." Max angrily pushed Ron aside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vincent frowned, saying, "We don't have enough ambulances to take everyone to the hospital. And even if we did, they don't have enough doctors to save them all..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah, it hurts so much!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Please, someone save me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>More employees began crying out in agony, rolling on the ground in sheer torment, creating a hellish scene.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Witnessing this, even Vincent and the usually composed Ava appeared at a loss.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let me try!" Suddenly, Alexander stepped forward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava, Vincent, and others looked at him in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Honey, do you have a way?" Ava hugged Alexander, her face full of excitement and hope.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander gave a wry smile. "There are so many people. Let me assess their condition first."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vincent mentioned it was some kind of neurotoxin, and Alexander wasn't sure if the Force would help in neutralizing it. Even if it did, there were too many critical patients.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vincent looked at Alexander with a peculiar expression, feeling low about the vast gap between them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's smile faded as he used his Force Sense to examine the patients.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that moment, he emitted an aura of calm authority that commanded respect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava looked at him with admiration, her eyes sparkling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vincent, Max, and others felt a sense of awe and even submission as they watched him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was unaware that as he tapped further into the Force, his strength and the energy he radiated would far surpass that of ordinary people.</span></p><div class="pagination">
