  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander estimated that it was around six in the morning when he heard the sound of chanting mixed with the deep tolling of bells and drums. Declan, lazily fanning himself with a large&nbsp;bible, strolled into the Combat Hall, accompanied by two young disciples.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the center of the hall stood a raised platform, where a canopy of golden-threaded silk cast a soft glow over a grand chair carved from nanmu wood. A small table sat beside it, complete with a pot and cups, meticulously arranged.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two young disciples positioned themselves behind the chair. Declan eased himself into the seat, idly flicking his fan and scratching his ear, a faint, knowing smile on his face. His voice echoed like rolling thunder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Does anyone have a question today?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One by one, disciples rose to ask about martial arts techniques or insights into their warrior's path. Each inquiry was only made after receiving permission.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander listened intently, gaining valuable insight. However, ever since returning to Darwin from&nbsp;Walgus Church, one question had weighed heavily on his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At first, he hadn't thought much of it, but as his martial arts training pushed him closer to the threshold of becoming a&nbsp;level-four warrior, the weight of this unresolved question grew heavier&mdash;like a towering mountain pressing down on his heart. If he didn't ask, he felt his progress would be forever stalled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Determined, Alexander stood up respectfully, waiting for Declan to acknowledge him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Alexander, Declan's eyes gleamed with amusement. "Alexander, what is your question?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's heart pounded as he hesitated, but after a moment of inner struggle, he pressed his palms together in a formal bow and asked in a steady voice, "Father Declan, may I ask why some priests commit evil deeds?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Declan's brows furrowed deeply, and he fell into a long silence. The entire hall went completely still. All eyes turned to Alexander. Some werefilled with shock, some with mockery, others with concern, and a few with burning anger...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Among the crowd, one person was absolutely thrilled&mdash;the pale, sharp-nosed aristocrat, Julius.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Waving his jade folding fan, he abruptly jumped to his feet and shouted, "Alexander! You've got some nerve! Slandering priests is the same as slandering&nbsp;Dominion Church! You should be expelled immediately!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a long pause, Declan's eyes gleamed with an intense light as he finally spoke, "During the time when God still walked the earth, there was an instance when he was teaching in the Assembly Hall of&nbsp;Sravasti. One of his disciples,&nbsp;Ananda, appeared deeply troubled. God asked him, 'Why are you so distressed?' Ananda replied that he had experienced a strange and unsettling dream the previous night, one that left him feeling shaken. God then asked, 'What did you dream of?'</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ananda bowed deeply and said, 'Honored God, I dreamed of priests who no longer followed your teachings. They cast aside their robes, abandoned discipline, and fell into darkness.'</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"God let out a long sigh and said, "'Ananda! This dream is a glimpse into the future&mdash;a time when some saints will preach the truth in words but not in practice. They will abandon their vows, turn against one another, discard their robes, indulge in worldly pleasures, even take wives, and commit countless misdeeds without fear of karmic retribution. In the end, they will fall. This is the great misfortune of the Dharma!'</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"'When I attained enlightenment, the demon lord&nbsp;Mara&nbsp;sent three temptresses&mdash;desire, greed, and pleasure&mdash;to sway me. But I was unmoved. I made them see their true nature, and in shame, they withdrew.'</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"'Mara then summoned an army of demons, but they, too, failed to defeat me.'</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"'Before retreating, Mara declared, "I cannot defeat you now. But in the years after you pass, I will send my demons into your monasteries. They will don your robes, claim to be priests, and corrupt your teachings from within."'</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"'After saying this, he looked at me, waiting for my response. But I could not speak&mdash;I could only weep in silence. Seeing this, Mara and his demons laughed wildly as they departed...'"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Declan paused after finishing the story. His eyes burned intensely as he fixed his gaze on Alexander and spoke in a voice that shook the hall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"God is God! The Dharma is the Dharma! A priest is a priest! Do you understand?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander felt as if a bucket of cold water had been poured over him, awakening his mind. Suddenly, everything became clear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The&nbsp;golden energy&nbsp;in his chest trembled violently. The&nbsp;Marrow-Cleansing Classic&nbsp;activated on its own, sending a mysterious and searing warmth coursing through his entire body. It merged with his&nbsp;Force, slowly seeping into his muscles, bones, and bloodstream&mdash;refining his very essence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The swirling&nbsp;Force&nbsp;in his&nbsp;martial core&nbsp;condensed tighter and tighter. Alexander took a deep breath and shouted, "I understand now! God is God! The Dharma is the Dharma! But not every priest is truly a priest! One must follow the teachings, not the individual!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Good! Excellent! 'Follow the teachings, not the individual'&mdash;what a remarkable insight! Hahaha..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Declan burst into hearty laughter, waving his&nbsp;bible&nbsp;with amusement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A genius!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every disciple turned to stare at Alexander. Some were filled with admiration, some with jealousy, others with disdain, while a few seemed lost in thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The only one who couldn't speak was Julius&mdash;his face had turned ashen with rage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Two hours later, Alexander returned to&nbsp;Kean Manor, but his heart was still racing with excitement.</span></p><div class="pagination">
