I'll watch over you from the shadows."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cloe perked up and instructed her bodyguard to open the iron gate before calmly walking inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A strange glint flashed in Alexander's eyes as he looked through Cloe's fitted skirt, catching a glimpse of her full figure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her shapely figure and long legs swayed elegantly, captivating his gaze entirely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander chuckled to himself; this vision was perfect for appreciating beauty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After waiting a moment for Cloe to enter, Alexander walked over as well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, several men in black stood at the entrance, staring coldly and expressionlessly at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sir, this is private property. Entry isn't allowed."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was stopped at the gate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm your most esteemed guest. You should be welcoming me, not blocking me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A strange glint appeared in Alexander's eyes as he looked at the lead guard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man's mind fogged over, and he stared at Alexander blankly, unable to speak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is this how you treat guests? Move aside!" Alexander commanded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's tone turned especially cold and unyielding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The men shook their heads, a look of confusion crossing their faces as they stammered, "Welcome. Please, come in..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander ignored them and walked inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Using his All-seeing Eyes and Force Control together, Alexander easily subdued them, feeling quite pleased with himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he walked, he took in the decor and layout of the castle-like building.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It felt like stepping into a medieval art gallery. It's an odd mix of Gothic and Baroque styles, creating an unsettling atmosphere.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander circled the ground-floor hall but didn't spot Cloe, and with a glint in his eyes, he realized she was on the second floor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He made his way upstairs quietly, staying alert and scanning his surroundings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was confident he'd detect anyone approaching, but facing a legendary sorcery lich, he couldn't afford to be careless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he moved further along the second floor, the decor shifted drastically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The windows grew smaller, intricately carved doors remained closed, and the dim lighting added a dark and eerie vibe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The walls were covered in various paintings, most of which were disturbing and macabre.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Twisted faces, crying children, bloodstained weapons... the paintings were shockingly vivid, even using 3D techniques for a powerful impact.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander paused at the hallway corner, his X-ray vision allowing him to see the scene at the other end without turning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Cloe was staring blankly at the paintings on the wall while her loyal guards had similarly dazed expressions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Rogers, do you think real demons exist in this world?" Cloe asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her voice wavered with fear, and her curvy figure trembled slightly, stirring certain desires in men.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Heh </span><span>heh</span><span>, you're perceptive, Ms. Bryant. You see the true meaning of this painting!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Henry was a refined, middle-aged man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had a square face, thick eyebrows, and large eyes, with a tall, well-built frame in a sharp, expensive suit, exuding a noble aura.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes, in particular, were bright and intense, with an eerie glow much like Alexander's.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The first time Alexander saw Henry, his heart tightened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was sure now. This man was the sorcery lich who controlled corpses!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, Alexander felt a growing sense of danger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since becoming a Warrior, it had been a long time since he felt this kind of threat. Now, as an Intermediate Warrior with All-seeing Eyes, he was stronger than ever.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was a Warrior's sixth sense, only triggered in the presence of formidable foes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander controlled his breathing and merged into the shadows, making himself nearly invisible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Henry is no ordinary foe. Better be cautious!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Liches were exceedingly rare, and Alexander had no idea what dark magic a sorcery lich might wield.</span></p><div class="pagination">
