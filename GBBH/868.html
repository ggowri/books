  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Now, Keith got himself into trouble. The other men, who had long disliked him, immediately surrounded him and wanted to beat him up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You are the hero, but how could you hit the supporting actor?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Come on, beat him up!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Though frightened, Keith relied on his strength and prepared to fight.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Stop it! What are you doing?" Harold roared. In an instant, several sturdy security guards rushed in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Anyone who dares to fight on the set will have their hands chopped off and will be expelled from Kylaville!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Harold's shout shocked everyone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Keith panicked. He punched the bald man first.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The bald man quickly accused Keith. "Harold, he hit me. Look, my face is swollen."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Yes, he hit him. Chop off his hands!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The supporting actors became excited and joined in blaming Keith.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Harold, look, my face is swollen!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As Harold didn't say anything, the bald man immediately showed his face in front of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Harold snorted with displeasure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"His hands must be chopped off, and he must be deprived of the qualification as an actor and be driven out of Kylaville!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"How dare you bully us by relying on your status as the hero?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The supporting actors shouted wildly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Harold, they were planning to take advantage of Ms. Barnes. In annoyance, I couldn't help but punch him," Keith stammered. After all, he started the fight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The bald man laughed triumphantly, "Harold, you heard it all. He admitted that he punched me. Punish him now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The next moment, Harold slapped him hard in the face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The bald man screamed, staggered, and almost fell.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone was dumbfounded. They gazed at Harold in confusion, wondering why he slapped the bald head instead of punishing Keith.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Harold growled, "Who are you all? You are all supporting actors. How dare you disrespect Mr. Robinson?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Haven't you read the employee handbook? You should have a sense of respect and hierarchy. Supporting actors can't provoke others, and those who deliberately target the heroine must be severely punished!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The supporting actors were scared to death, but before they could beg for mercy, Harold waved his hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Drag these bastards out, strip them of their acting credentials, and break one of their hands."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At Harold's command, a dozen burly men rushed over aggressively, grabbed the supporting actors who had caused trouble, and dragged them away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>There was complete silence. The others and even Keith were perplexed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It turned out that the company had a rule that the leading actors were far superior to the supporting actors and that no one could deliberately bully the heroines.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Keith took a deep breath and felt very excited.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He never expected to be respected one day. After the bald man was slapped, he was not the one who suffered. That was the hierarchy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "Thanks to Mr. Hawthorne, I am honored today!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Keith was thrilled. His life changed. How lucky!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After those supporting actors were expelled, several more were added.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Knowing what had just happened, they immediately greeted Keith politely, showing great respect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He was outwardly calm but inwardly overjoyed. It took him a long time to regain his composure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "Mr. Hawthorne, you are my idol. My life belongs to you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon, Harold signaled that all the actors could enter the studio.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Keith walked in the front, followed by several supporting actors, and they entered Studio 36 together.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Harold told everyone that the official filming was about to begin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At that moment, Amira emerged from another corridor, dressed in a small suit, a white shirt, a black miniskirt, and high heels, the professional attire that teachers often wore.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As the filming began, several supporting actors rushed forward, kidnapped Amira, who was pretending to be passing by, and pushed her into a dilapidated warehouse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, Keith appeared nervously, preparing for his debut.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With a black whip, he slowly approached Amira.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>How pitiful! Her shirt and miniskirt had been removed, and only her sexy lace underwear was left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As a result of her constant struggle, her plump, full breasts seemed to jump out of her bra.</span></p><div class="pagination">
