One scratch would ensure infection.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the next second, Henry's smile froze on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander moved like an agile monkey through the headless corpses, attacking repeatedly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bang!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander kicked one of the corpses hard in the knee.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although it felt no pain, its entire leg twisted and broke, causing it to collapse to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dodging two more corpses, Alexander grabbed a steel bar from a hole in the wall, yanking it out with a fierce shout.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander swung the steel bar, channeling the Force into it, causing it to emit a faint white glow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a single swing, he easily sent two headless corpses flying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He charged back and forth, breaking the bones and tendons of each corpse, leaving them crumpled at his feet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The number of corpses between Henry and Alexander dwindled, and Henry began to back away in fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Whoosh!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander suddenly threw the steel bar, which struck Henry squarely in the chest with force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ahh!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Accompanied by a horrific scream, Henry flew through the air like a ragdoll, spitting blood before landing heavily on the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All the corpses in front of him had been taken down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>More corpses came rushing through the hole in the wall, pouncing toward Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bang!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Another corpse was sent flying, slamming into the wall and making it tremble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The corpse couldn't withstand such force and broke apart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander leaped into the air and stomped hard on two incoming corpses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Crack! Crack!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A series of bone-cracking sounds echoed as the two corpses were flattened like trash under a compactor, collapsing to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander moved quickly, taking down over a dozen more corpses in the blink of an eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Out of my way!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a powerful roundhouse kick, he struck the last corpse, splitting it in two on the spot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Cough... cough..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this point, Henry lay on the ground, coughing up blood uncontrollably.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The steel bar had broken several of his ribs, piercing his lungs and making each breath excruciatingly painful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You bastard... I'll kill you..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Henry muttered curses at Alexander, seething with anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He never imagined someone this powerful could exist, able to handle dozens of fearsome, unfeeling corpses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander ignored him, glancing coldly at the corpses scattered on the ground, his expression grim.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The headless corpses, despite their broken limbs, continued to twitch and struggle on the ground with a frightening persistence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cloe looked at the writhing severed limbs on the ground and felt nauseous, almost throwing up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander walked over to Henry, looking down at him from above.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that instant, Henry felt an intense, chilling killing intent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His chest throbbed with pain, making it impossible to breathe, and he couldn't even lift a finger&mdash;he was left to wait for death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't kill me... I can tell you the secrets of corpse-controlling magic... if I die, the necromancer's legacy dies with me, and that would be a great loss!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Desperate to save his life, Henry had no choice but to beg.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Corpse magic? Ha, I'm not interested!" Alexander sneered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander sneered, pressing his foot down on Henry's chest as a surge of Force exploded from him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Henry's entire chest caved in, and he didn't even have time to scream before he died instantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander searched Henry's body, finding a few ancient book pages in his inner pocket.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The pages contained fragmented records of corpse-controlling magic, along with some other necromancer spells.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmph, harmful things like this shouldn't be kept around."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander waved his hand, and white flames ignited on the pages, turning them to ash instantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the Ultimate Legacy, he had no need for such dark magic, and he didn't want to become something neither human nor ghostly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cloe spoke up, concerned, "Boss, the Red Umbrella Group must know that Guzman's gone, or they wouldn't have hired Henry to attack our trading center."</span></p><div class="pagination">
