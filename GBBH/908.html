  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The bartender froze, staring in disbelief at his now-empty weapon. Frustration boiled over, and he hurled the gun at Alexander with all his strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander raised a hand, catching the bartender across the face with a brutal slap.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sharp crack echoed in the room, and the bartender crumpled to the ground, spitting out several bloodied teeth. Half his face swelled like an overripe fruit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't until this moment that Norma snapped out of her shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When the bartender had fired at Alexander, she'd been so terrified she nearly passed out. Now, seeing how decisively Alexander had turned the tables, she felt a rush of relief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You... you're a demon!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The bartender's voice quivered as he glared up at Alexander, his face a mask of pale fury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he hadn't experienced it himself, he never would've believed anyone could move that fast.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Last chance. Tell me where Hazel is, or I'll make you regret every decision you've ever made."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was convinced that the bartender held the most crucial information at the scene.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The temperature in the room seemed to drop as Alexander's presence grew more oppressive, his killing intent suffocating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The bartender clenched his teeth, his voice barely a whisper. "You're wasting your time. Even if I tell you, I'm a dead man."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander didn't reply. Instead, he stepped forward, each measured movement sending shockwaves through the bartender's resolve.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Scrambling backward in pure panic, the bartender toppled chairs and tables, even knocking over a towering liquor shelf in his desperation. Finally, he hit the wall, cornered like a caged animal. His eyes darted around wildly, but there was no escape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You really want to test me?" Alexander's tone was unsettlingly calm, a faint smile tugging at the corners of his mouth. Oddly enough, that smile was more terrifying than any glare.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I hope you hold onto that stubborn streak," Alexander continued, almost cheerfully. "It'll make this more interesting."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He raised his hand and pressed it firmly to the bartender's forehead. Without warning, an invisible force shot through the man's body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A guttural scream erupted as the bartender dropped to the ground, his body convulsing uncontrollably. It felt as though blades were twisting through his nerves, slicing him apart from the inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cold sweat poured off him, soaking his clothes as his thrashing weakened. Eventually, he lay there, trembling, barely able to moan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander chuckled softly, his foot landing on the man's leg.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a sickening crunch, the bartender's femur snapped like a dry twig.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He screamed again, the sound raw and piercing, but Alexander wasn't done.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A second crunch followed, then a third. By the time he stopped, the bartender's leg was a mangled, misshapen ruin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My leg... no, no..." The bartender's voice was barely audible, his wide eyes fixed on the grotesque sight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Pain consumed him, waves of agony crashing from his shattered leg to the force tearing through his mind and body. His vision blurred, and his head lolled, seconds from losing consciousness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's palm struck the bartender's shoulder, sending another surge of force into his body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The force, capable of healing or destroying, unleashed unbearable agony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the bartender teetered on the edge of unconsciousness, the force jolted him back, forcing him to endure the torment anew.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His screams reached a new crescendo, raw and desperate. The bartender's suffering was so extreme that even the hardened thugs in the room felt their stomachs turn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Sakra Society members had seen their fair share of bloodshed, but this was something else. They shifted uncomfortably, sweat beading on their foreheads despite the cool air. Alexander wasn't just brutal. He was terrifying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Standing over the writhing man, Alexander tilted his head, his expression unreadable. "Tell me. Where's Hazel?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll talk! Please, I'll tell you everything!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The bartender finally cracked. His spirit shattered, his pride abandoned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hazel... she's at Base One. That's all I know! Please, let me go... I'll do anything."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The bartender spilled everything, then dropped to his knees, clutching Alexander's leg in a desperate plea for mercy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop right there!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A furious voice thundered as a mob of men stormed in, bristling with hostility.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You thugs have no business causing trouble here!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Leave now, or die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The bartender's head snapped toward the familiar voice. His eyes filled with a sudden, desperate hope.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hunter! You're here! We're saved! They're here to save us!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
