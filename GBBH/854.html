  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The female dealer trembled as she dealt the cards.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander smiled and said, "Since it's all-in, let's not drag it out. Show your cards!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Benjamin's arrogant expression disappeared, replaced by a serious, focused look.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A true gambling master always took their opponent seriously, even if they seemed inferior.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander's revealed cards were a pair of kings and a pair of nines. If his hidden card was another king, he'd have a full house&mdash;three kings and a pair of nines.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It wasn't a small hand, but it wasn't the strongest either.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Benjamin's hand showed a potential royal flush, hearts 10, J, Q, and K. If his hidden card was the ace of hearts, he'd win with a royal flush.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ha ha! You've lost! I have a royal flush!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Benjamin laughed, grabbed his hidden card, and, with a smug flourish, slapped it onto the table.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Slap!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The card flipped over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Benjamin froze, his triumphant shout cut short as if an eagle had clutched a chick by the neck. He was completely stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"How is this possible?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Benjamin was bewildered. He was sure he had seen the ace of hearts, so how had it turned into the five of hearts?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His royal flush was now a worthless hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Impossible! I saw it clearly; it was the ace of hearts... It couldn't be the five! You cheated, you trickster!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Benjamin roared furiously, accusing Alexander of cheating. The irony was laughable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander chuckled. "I didn't cheat. You must not have slept well last night. Too tense, seeing things, huh?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Even if my hidden card is useless, my two pairs still beat you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander looked at Benjamin with a scornful gaze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This guy had simply been influenced by Force Control, making him hallucinate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thud!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Moments ago, Benjamin had been seething, but now he deflated like a punctured balloon, slumping into his chair with a grim expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Did we win?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Unbelievable!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The surveillance room fell silent at first, then erupted into hushed murmurs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The chatter grew louder, bubbling like boiling water as the atmosphere intensified.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Winning all of the gambling king's assets in one hand, they were ecstatic, even more so than Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"We won!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Norma took a deep breath, struggling to contain her excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Impressive! Inviting him was the best decision I've made."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Still unwilling to accept defeat, Benjamin shouted at Alexander, "You cheated! I want to see the replay!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Shut your mouth!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marvin slapped Benjamin hard, making him spit blood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander laughed, stopping Marvin. "No need to be so rough. Drag him out."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marvin stepped forward, grabbed Benjamin by the neck, and dragged him out like he was taking out the trash.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was peak hours in the casino.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The place was bustling, filled with noise and excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander stood in the center of the hall while Marvin tossed Benjamin to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ow!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Benjamin hit the floor, his face bruised and battered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What's going on? What happened?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"How could anyone dare start a fight here? Don't they know this is the Dragon Gang's casino? They must have a death wish."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Keep your voice down. If the Dragon Gang isn't intervening, these guys must be part of it. That old man must've cheated; otherwise, he wouldn't be getting beaten up."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"He's that old and still cheating?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The murmurs among the gamblers spread like waves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone craned their necks, waiting for the mystery to unfold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander exuded an air of sharp authority, his presence commanding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This old man is Benjamin, ranked second worldwide in gambling skills, known as the gambling king. But he cheated here in our casino, got caught, and lost everything."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"As the gambling king, he should know the rules. You lose, you pay. Cut off one hand and get lost!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marvin drew a dagger and tossed it in front of Benjamin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The gleaming blade glinted coldly under the lights.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>What?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This old man was the famed gambling king, Benjamin?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Benjamin cheated and lost everything?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And who was this young man? Was his gambling skill really that impressive?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone was in disbelief!</span></p><div class="pagination">
