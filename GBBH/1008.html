  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Betty, you really are Alexander's loyal lapdog! Since you refuse to surrender, there's nothing I can do for you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Asher's grin was sickening, like the devil himself peering through the gates of hell.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With chilling calmness, he pulled out his cell phone and dialed a number.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Leave no one alive. Kill them all!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His cold, vicious order sent a ripple of fear through Betty and her crew from the Ultimate Alliance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Asher flicked on the speakerphone, and instantly, the sounds of chaos erupted from the device, including screams, shouts, and the unmistakable rat-tat-tat of gunfire. It was a massacre happening in real-time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was his way of asserting dominance, showing that he had no qualms about wiping out entire Ultimate Alliance strongholds without a second thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The tension in the room became palpable. Every second that passed without Alexander's arrival made the situation feel more dire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From the sounds coming through the phone, it was clear that the battle had become completely one-sided.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Betty's face darkened. Even with the strategy to lure the enemy deeper into their trap, the cost was mounting. The casualties were too high.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Asher took in the tangled web of emotions on the faces of the Ultimate Alliance members, including shock, anger, and fear, a slow, triumphant smile spread across his lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey, Betty, do you really want to die for Alexander? I'll give you one last chance. Surrender, and maybe I'll let you live. For now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course, if you don't surrender, well, you all die.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They definitely don't want to die with you, do they?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A murderous glint flickered in Asher's eyes, as if he was already picturing their brutal end.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Around Betty, some of her subordinates, who were weak-willed and terrified, started to tremble. Their eyes shifted nervously, contemplating the idea of surrender.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, not everyone had the guts to face death head-on. Asher wasn't just a ruthless killer; he was a master at breaking their spirit from the inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One phone call and one threat were enough to make the morale of everyone present wavered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Ultimate Alliance was outnumbered, and now, their resolve was shaken. The situation had become even more dangerous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Asher declared, "Surrender! The first one to surrender not only gets a million dollars but also becomes my personal bodyguard. What do you say?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His bait was tempting, and his triumphant smile grew wider.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Betty bellowed, "Anyone who surrenders will be the first to die! Do you really think Asher will let you live after you betray your own allies? Boss treats us like family. </span><span>You all know that!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We all have guns in our hands. It's not over until it's over. Don't be fooled by Asher's tricks!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Listen, if you drop your weapons, you'll be like helpless fish on a chopping board, just waiting for Asher to slice you to pieces. Do you really want to hand over your life to a lowlife like him?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her words hit like a thunderclap, jolting those who had been wavering back to reality.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's right! We have guns! What are we afraid of? Let's fight!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even if we die, we'll take as many of them with us as we can! Our members didn't die for nothing. We fight to avenge them!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fight!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After her words of encouragement, a fresh wave of determination washed over everyone, lifting their spirits and reigniting their resolve.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, Asher's expression darkened, his face twisting into a fierce scowl.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He demanded, "</span><span>Windwolf</span><span>, teach them a lesson!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, a black figure exploded from behind Asher, moving like a gust of wind. The room blurred as the figure closed the distance toward Betty with terrifying speed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Careful!" someone shouted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before anyone could fully react, Philip lunged forward, placing himself between Betty and the incoming threat. He raised his gun, finger tensing on the trigger, ready to fire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the black-clad figure moved even quicker, showing no sign of evasion. He lunged, accelerating so suddenly that it was like a bird taking flight. The speed was astonishing, leaving barely a blink of time to react.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the blink of an eye, </span><span>Windwolf</span><span> flickered to Philip's side and seized his right arm to twist with brutal force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sound of snapping bone echoed through the room, followed by Philip's agonized scream. His right arm hung useless, dangling at a sickening angle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Son of a bitch!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One of the Ultimate Alliance members cursed, drawing their weapons to lunge forward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, the black-clad figure came to a halt, standing perfectly still. Now, everyone could see a lanky man, roughly forty years old. His face was etched in a fierce, murderous scowl. He exuded a powerful aura, the kind that only a metahuman possessed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He flashed a ferocious grin. "A bunch of trash dares to go against Mr. Vance? Go to hell!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A series of anguished wails filled the air as several members of the Ultimate Alliance, stationed at the front, were suddenly sent flying backward. They hit the ground hard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man nicknamed "</span><span>Windwolf</span><span>" surged into the crowd of Ultimate Alliance members like a tempest unleashed, moving with blinding speed. With each strike, accompanied by the shrill screams of his victims, another member of the alliance crumpled to the ground. His attacks were as relentless as a vicious wolf tearing through a helpless flock of sheep. Nothing could stop him.</span></p><div class="pagination">
