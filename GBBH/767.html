Alyssa asked, curiosity and confusion flickering in her gaze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I have my ways. Rest for a moment and watch me handle this," he said in a calm tone, as if Woodrow and Kerwin were no more than helpless chickens waiting for the slaughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you, Boss!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alyssa looked as though she might throw herself into his arms at any moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her feelings for Alexander had started as admiration and fear, along with a desire to secure her own interests by staying close to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, it was different. His timely rescue had stirred something deep within her, an affection she could hardly put into words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This powerful leader of the Axe gang was, at this moment, reduced to gazing dreamily at Alexander, her thoughts in a daze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander chuckled, understanding her reaction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, she'd been on the brink of torture and despair, only to be saved at the very last moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her growing attachment was only natural.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Woodrow felt deeply insulted as Alexander ignored him entirely, laughing and chatting with Alyssa instead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He spat angrily, "Alexander, since you've walked right in, you might as well stay here with that bitch!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kerwin quickly chimed in, his eyes gleaming with greed, "Once we take him down, we'll be handsomely rewarded!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's gaze turned cold as he strode toward them, his deep eyes swirling like whirlpools, as if ready to draw them in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Woodrow instinctively took a step back, clutching a dark rod with a vicious grip.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop! Don't come any closer! Take another step, and I'll finish you off!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A sinister black mist began to rise from the rod, swirling around Woodrow's body, exuding a nauseating stench.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With his All-seeing Eyes, Alexander saw the mist for what it was&mdash;a swarm of tiny, hair-thin witchcraft insects, twisted and menacing, in countless numbers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet Alexander did not slow his steps. He continued his approach, his eyes flashing with a fierce glint as he commanded, "Kneel down and await your end!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The words held an imperial authority, like an emperor issuing orders to his subjects.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll make you kneel, you bastard!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Woodrow bellowed, swinging the rod and directing the black mist toward Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a wave of his hand, Alexander conjured a blaze of white flames that instantly turned the mist to ash.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Force-fueled flames had reached a temperature so intense that the witchcraft insects disintegrated in moments.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a swift move, Alexander seized Woodrow's rod, snapping it in two.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A stream of black gas escaped, spilling onto Woodrow's face as the insects crawled </span><span>rapidly into his eyes, nose, ears, and mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Woodrow let out a blood-curdling scream, collapsing to the ground, writhing in agony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In seconds, his skin turned black, rotting as dark blood oozed out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Serves you right. A fitting end."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander kicked Woodrow's corpse aside, turning his gaze on the terrified Kerwin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kerwin began to stammer, but Alexander moved with lightning speed, grabbing him by the head and twisting it sharply.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Crack!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A loud crack echoed as Kerwin's neck broke, his face twisted backward, his lifeless eyes staring wide as his body crumpled to the floor.</span></p><div class="pagination">
