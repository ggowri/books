  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aiden slammed the table and shouted, "Xavier, why are you siding with him? Are you still part of this family? You've disrespected me, the head of the Ulysses family, and teamed up with outsiders to bully Angelica. I'll have you and your mother expelled!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Xavier was trembling with anger, unable to speak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Xavier, let's go. Forget them," Alexander urged, pulling Xavier away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Xavier, from today, you're no longer part of the Ulysses family!" Aiden shouted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Xavier stopped, turned back, and walked towards Aiden. Seeing this, Aiden smirked triumphantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Scared now, are you? Hand over the Phoenix Gemstone Establishment, or you'll be kicked out of </span><span>Loscity</span><span>."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a loud slap, Xavier struck Aiden hard. Aiden cried out, clutching his cheek in shock. The Ulysses family members were stunned; they never expected Xavier to hit Aiden.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Xavier said fiercely, "Aiden, do you think I want to stay in this family? If anyone tries to take over Phoenix Gemstone Establishment again, they'll regret it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aiden roared, "Xavier, if you don't apologize and compensate me today, I'll report you to Sir Stewart of the Kaylon. You'll have no place in </span><span>Loscity</span><span>."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander sneered, "Do you think the Kaylon will help you? Even if they do, it won't matter. Xavier is under my protection now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aiden laughed derisively, "You young fool, you think you can ignore the Kaylon?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not wanting to waste more time, Alexander started to leave with Xavier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop! You can't leave!" Kevin shouted, stepping forward to block their path.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Move," Alexander said coldly, glaring at Kevin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kevin sneered, "You bullied Angelica. Apologize and return the gem."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander began a countdown, "Three, two..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kevin dismissed it, saying, "Angelica is my girlfriend. You crossed her, and I'll teach you a lesson."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angelica chimed in, "Kevin, you're amazing! I love you! Make him apologize a thousand times."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"One," Alexander finished, moving forward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kevin lunged with a grim smile, aiming for Alexander's collarbone. His attack was swift and precise, intended to incapacitate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But in a flash, Alexander and Xavier had moved. Kevin missed and stood stunned at Alexander's speed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Kevin prepared to chase them, a sharp pain shot through his ankle. He fell, </span><span>howling in pain. A small stone had struck his ankle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kevin, are you okay?" Angelica rushed to his side.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Embarrassed, Kevin muttered, "I just twisted my ankle..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angelica turned to Aiden, "Dad, get someone to catch them!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Alexander and Xavier were already gone. Aiden said, "They run fast, but don't worry, they can't leave the city."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angelica fumed, "Dad, they took the gem! Why didn't you send someone after them?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aiden replied coolly, "With Kevin here, they can't escape. Kevin, are you alright?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kevin, embarrassed, said, "I'm fine. I just hurried too much. I'll be okay tomorrow."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aiden, Angelica, don't worry. I'll get the gem back and make them apologize!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unaware that Alexander had thrown the stone, Kevin remained confident.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angelica continued to curse Alexander and Xavier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Outside, Xavier felt uneasy. He knew he was in big trouble and feared how Julia would react.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He turned to Alexander, "Please, help me and my mother!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Xavier pleaded for Alexander's support.</span></p><div class="pagination">
