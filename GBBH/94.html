  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Sebastian shuddered in fear, thinking, "If Alexander dies, who will lift the curse off me?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Guzman mentioned bringing in a black-robed sorcerer, but I'm not taking that chance."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Alexander, are you deaf? Apologize now, or I'll order the men to shoot!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Andrew's voice was brimming with arrogance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Sebastian, enraged, wanted to kill Andrew on the spot. He shouted, "Damn you! Are you trying to get me killed?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Andrew, immediately sensing the danger, turned to Alexander like a whipped dog.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mr. Sebastian Tate is asking you&mdash;are you trying to kill Mr. Sebastian Tate?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Fuck you, Andrew! I'm talking about you!" Sebastian roared, his anger boiling over.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With his last ounce of strength, he kicked Andrew hard in the groin.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Ah!" Andrew shrieked in agony, clutching his groin.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jane and the others stood in shock, unable to comprehend why Sebastian had attacked Andrew.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mr. Sebastian Tate, what are you doing? Why are you hitting me?" Andrew groaned, barely able to speak.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Why? Because you dared to point a gun at Mr. Hawthorne. Not only do I want to hit you, I want to see you dead!" Sebastian's voice was laced with fury.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The Fairfax family members were stunned into silence, feeling as though they were trapped in a nightmare.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">They thought, "How can Sebastian, who has watched Theodore's hands being ruined, still be aiding Alexander?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It's beyond comprehension."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the midst of their bewilderment, Sebastian bowed deeply to Alexander, his tone now respectful and pleading.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mr. Hawthorne, I'm willing to tell you Guzman's whereabouts, but he's very cautious, hardly staying in one place for more than half a day. So, if you could ease my suffering first, I'll cooperate with you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Sebastian looked at Alexander with hopeful eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander studied him for a moment before smiling, "I didn't expect you to be so cooperative. I thought you'd hold out for at least a couple of days. But how do I know the information you give me is genuine?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The place fell into eerie silence, broken only by Sebastian's desperate pleas.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mr. Hawthorne, I swear I won't lie to you. Please, please spare me... I apologize on behalf of my son. We were wrong, we were wrong..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His face was streaked with tears, his sincerity palpable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander, however, turned to Andrew and the others, a cold smile on his face. "They say you have a bounty on me. Is that true?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Sebastian's anger reached a boiling point.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He pointed at Andrew, seething.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Grab him, break his legs, and make him apologize to Mr. Hawthorne."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Andrew, writhing in pain, begged Alexander, "Alexander, I'm sorry, I'm sorry... For the sake of being your ex-wife's father, please don't let them break my legs... Please..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander remained indifferent. "That wasn't your attitude a moment ago, was it? You were just aiming a gun at me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Sebastian snapped his fingers sharply. "What are you all standing around for? Drag him aside and teach this worthless scum a lesson. Break his legs!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Several men moved quickly, pinning Andrew down and beating him mercilessly, making him writhe and cry out on the ground.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jane and the rest of the Fairfax family, terrified, turned and fled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Andrew, bloodied and battered, lay helpless on the ground, no longer able to resist.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just as someone was about to bring out a baseball bat to break his legs, Alexander finally spoke up, "Enough. Let him go."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The Brilliant Group members stood frozen, unsure whether to follow Alexander's command.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Sebastian, enraged, shouted, "Are you deaf? Did you not hear Mr. Hawthorne's orders? Get him out of here and throw him in the trash!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Andrew was quickly dragged away and unceremoniously tossed into a dumpster.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander gazed at Andrew's predicament with a deep sense of ruefulness. "This is what you call reaping what you sow," Alexander murmured.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Sebastian, desperate and pleading, implored, "Mr. Hawthorne, I'll do whatever you ask, just please, let me off the hook."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander, with a flat, almost indifferent tone, asked, "I've crippled your son's hands. Aren't you going to seek revenge on me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Sebastian shook his head vigorously. "No, no! That was his own fault for crossing Mr. Hawthorne. He brought this upon himself."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander continued, "You really will give me Guzman's whereabouts?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Sebastian nodded eagerly, like a chicken pecking at grain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'm a man of my word. Honestly, I've never liked him anyway. I'll cooperate one hundred percent."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander grinned, his sharp gaze fixed on Sebastian. "I think you're just stalling, trying to get someone else to handle me, aren't you?"</p><div class="pagination">
