  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Devil Island lay just over 100 nautical miles from Treasure Island and covered about two-thirds of its size, making it a sizable piece of land.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Last night, a large cargo ship had approached the island.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>By dawn, more than a dozen helicopters descended.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander led the advance team, setting up a magic circle to dampen the storms surrounding the island. He then guided the cargo ship closer, offloading weapons, ammunition, and supplies onto Devil Island.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Only Marvin, Charlize, and Rosalia stayed behind in Loscity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even Augusta, who had just arrived in Loscity with elite forces, came to Devil Island with William and Logan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>While flying over the island in the helicopter, Alexander had spotted a clear spring that flowed across the island, providing a vital fresh water source.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This water abundance made Devil Island highly valuable for development.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Verdant trees thrived under the island's lush conditions, and its scenic beauty was striking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Should the island be developed, it would easily rival Treasure Island.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And with the two islands supporting each other, their defensive capabilities would be significantly enhanced.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Unload quickly and conceal everything. According to intelligence, the Dragon Gang's ship will arrive within a few hours," Alexander commanded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Over a thousand people began moving with urgency.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Late that night, under the moonlight, ripples spread across the sea as a large cargo ship neared Devil Island.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Spotlights illuminated the scene as the ship deployed numerous modified high-speed motorboats.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon, over a dozen boats, each carrying dozens of people, sped across the water toward Devil Island.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The men on board were dressed in black uniforms. Though they were not particularly tall, they exuded a fierce and murderous air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They carried automatic rifles, and some had katanas strapped to their backs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Several captains, identifiable by their uniforms reinforced with protective padding at the chest and joints, commanded the Dragon Gang's landing force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The engines roared, propelling the motorboats like arrows shot from a bow, leaving trails in their wake.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Hurry, guide the cargo ship closer so we can bring the heavy equipment and supplies ashore," a burly, scar-faced man barked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He carried a new M16 with a katana strapped to his waist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Bro, didn't the boss spend billions of dollars on buying Devil Island? Isn't that a bit of a waste?" asked a short man beside him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Though their builds were vastly different, they shared a striking resemblance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The scar-faced man glared at his younger brother. "You've no idea. Our boss is securing a fallback plan. Our conflicts with the Sakura Society are escalating, and now, they're allied with the Mafia and have military support."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The short man sighed, "That spells trouble for us. I even heard some people wanted to rebel, saying our boss was just a woman and should step down."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Shut up! That's not something we should talk about. Just focus on your job," the scar-faced man admonished, cutting the conversation short.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His gaze swept over the dark woods nearby.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Suddenly, his brother chuckled, "Actually, taking over Devil Island is a good move. It's only 100 miles from Treasure Island, and now, we've driven a stake right in the shipping route to the mainland.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If we want to sink their ships, we can, and they'll have no choice but to pay us protection fees."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The scar-faced man nodded. "You're right. Once we set up defenses, I'll find a chance to sink a few of their vessels and force Treasure Island to supply us regularly."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Just then, the short man took a call.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He grinned, "Good news, bro. Aidan's reinforcements will be here soon. With our abilities, we'll take Treasure Island with no trouble."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Good, we'll take Treasure Island," Casper laughed with anticipation.</span></p><div class="pagination">
