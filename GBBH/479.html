  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Earlier, I only temporarily relieved your pain to see how you'd behave. You did alright, so for the next year, you won't feel any pain."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's tone was calm as he reached out and tapped both of them on the head, suppressing the Force he'd left in their bodies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thanks, boss! It doesn't hurt anymore!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Arthur and Timothy were ecstatic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's eyes flashed with a sly glint as he smiled, "It won't happen often now, but remember, it'll flare up once a year at the end of December. Come find me then, and I'll help suppress it temporarily."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Arthur and Timothy had been overjoyed, but their happiness faded as fast as a bucket of ice water on a winter day.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once a year? That meant they'd be Alexander's lapdogs for life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their faces went from joyful to utterly dismal in seconds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's wrong? Not happy about it? Think once a year is too much? Would you rather deal with random, constant pain? How about that instead?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's smile held a hint of coldness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Arthur and Timothy couldn't force a smile, their heads shaking quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, no! Please, not that. Boss, we'll do whatever you say. Once a year sounds great!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander already knew these two hated his guts, but they were too weak for him to bother using his Force to fully control them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't want to waste his power on them, so he left a little "insurance" to keep them obedient.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>.....</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the slums on the outskirts of </span><span>Tijuanea</span><span>, low buildings and shabby tents were packed together in disarray.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Trash was scattered everywhere, dirty water pooled along the streets, and homeless people could be seen huddled in corners.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luckily, with the widespread use of the magic powder, there weren't many addicts left. Otherwise, this place would've been in even worse shape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey, boss Timothy! Hey, Arthur!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seven or eight men saw Timothy and Arthur and immediately greeted them with enthusiasm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Timothy barked, "Are you all blind? Greet Mr. Hawthorne!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The men froze, then quickly bowed to Alexander in unison.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Good day, Mr. Hawthorne!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Timothy bent over, smiling obsequiously at Alexander. "Boss, that scammer Victor lives here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander eyed the shabby shack with disbelief. This guy always acted like some bigshot in front of Lynn, boasting about being a successful businessman, but he lived in a dump like this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Grab him!" Alexander ordered casually.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"On it, Boss! No need for you to dirty your hands."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Timothy rolled up his sleeves and charged forward, kicking the rickety wooden door with all his might.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The door, already barely hanging on, didn't stand a chance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>BANG!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a loud bang, it flew off its hinges and crashed to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The group barged in like a pack of wolves, and soon, Victor's terrified cries echoed from inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't long before he was dragged out, his arms twisted behind him like some stray dog.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Victor had just taken a dose of magic powder, still in a blissful high, so it took a moment for reality to sink in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Timothy grabbed a bottle of water and splashed it in Victor's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Victor shivered, blinking at the group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All he saw were fierce expressions and a knife at his throat, the blade already nicking his skin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Please, don't kill me! Please!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Victor's face turned ghostly pale as he pleaded for his life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smirked, "Be honest. Why did you try to scam Lynn?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You?! It's you? You son of a&mdash;"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Victor's shout was cut off by Timothy's hard slap across his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Watch your mouth, old man! How dare you speak to our boss like that? You got a death wish?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Timothy barked while Arthur kicked Victor in the stomach, sending him sprawling to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You heard him. Answer the boss' question, or I'll skin you alive."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Arthur twirled the knife, grinning wickedly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Victor finally realized how screwed he was, almost wetting himself in fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why did you scam Lynn?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's voice was icy, cold enough to freeze anyone in their tracks.</span></p><div class="pagination">
