  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Facing an opponent like this, most would have been overwhelmed and injured by now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But to the two women, Alexander seemed supernaturally fast&mdash;so fast they could barely keep up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These women were experts in coordinated strikes. They had fought metahumans with level-three speed powers and had taken down opponents after just a few exchanges.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, they played their hand, pretending to be serving staff delivering dishes. They attacked first with hand crossbows, then moved in for a close-quarters assault.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had been confident, almost certain of victory. But to their astonishment, they hadn't even touched the hem of Alexander's clothes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smirked. He had dodged their every move without retaliating, curious to see just how skilled they were.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, these women were elite members of the Tiger Strike Squad and ranked among the top fighters of the Morris family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, they were growing desperate. They couldn't land a single hit&mdash;Alexander was simply too fast.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This wasn't going as planned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two women's faces twisted with frustration, but they didn't back down or attempt to flee.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Retreating meant showing their backs to the enemy, and that was as good as a death sentence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The only way out was to kill Alexander or at least injure him, giving them a chance to escape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two moved like vipers, relentless in their attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, Alexander retreated a couple of steps, his back hitting a messy table and chairs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their eyes lit up&mdash;this was their chance!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grinning maliciously, they prepared their final strike. Based on countless successful kills in the past, they knew that if Alexander stepped back again, he'd trip over the furniture. He'd either fall or be injured, giving them the opening they needed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Alexander had no intention of retreating anymore. He stood his ground with a mocking smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A sense of foreboding washed over the women. A chill ran down their spines.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, they didn't hesitate. This was a do-or-die moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they lunged forward, everything blurred before their eyes. Alexander vanished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander descended from above, a white blade of light slicing through the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The speed of his Lightsaber was blinding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the blink of an eye, the woman on the left was cut in half at the waist. Her lower body continued forward a few steps before collapsing to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The other woman was impaled through the chest and sent straight to hell.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander had struck once, and both were dead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Augusta wasn't slacking off either, cutting through the remaining members of the Morris family with ease.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A dozen or so more guards, armed with either guns or gleaming poison-soaked machetes, rushed in from all directions, responding to the sound of gunfire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had no idea what had transpired inside the tent, nor had they seen Alexander cut down the two women in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Like wolves howling, they charged, weapons raised, launching a ferocious assault.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though not particularly strong, these guards were considered elite&mdash;fast and well-coordinated, moving in formation as they closed in on Alexander and Augusta.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Alexander had sheathed his Lightsaber, uninterested in handling this mob personally. He left it all to Augusta.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, dozens of figures appeared behind the guards, silently moving in for the kill.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Augusta's men, each armed with suppressed assault rifles, took position like invisible assassins.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The slaughter began.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Morris family's guards were mid-charge when they were gunned down from behind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One after another, they fell, heads exploding, backs bleeding out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As some turned to see what was happening, panic erupted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We're surrounded!" someone screamed in terror.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the worst was yet to come. Augusta charged into the fray, cutting through them like a reaper.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The guards couldn't even touch her&mdash;it was a one-sided massacre.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This temporary camp of the Morris family served not only to entertain guests but also as an outpost to defend against possible attacks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had stationed strong defenses here, including a third of the Tiger Strike Squad.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two women who had just attacked Alexander were among the top five fighters in the Squad, and together, they were nearly the top three.</span></p><div class="pagination">
