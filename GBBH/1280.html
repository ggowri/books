  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The intense waves of pleasure nearly made Sally blackout.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She couldn't help but think about all her ex-boyfriends. None of them had ever made her feel anything close to this, even when they'd tried their hardest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh god," Sally gasped, her breath hot and heavy. She pulled Alexander closer, pressing his face against her chest as her waist moved rhythmically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next morning, just as dawn was breaking, Sally was still sound asleep when Alexander's eyes suddenly snapped open.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He spotted a dark figure charging toward them from the distance. It was an agility-type zombie, moving at incredible speeds that could rival an Olympic sprinter. No ordinary person would stand a chance of outrunning it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Alexander had detected it the moment it started its charge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His mind was already calculating exactly how many seconds it would take for the agile zombie to reach them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He factored in everything&mdash;the terrain, slopes, wind speed, and even the scattered bushes in its path. His enhanced mental capabilities allowed him to process data like a supercomputer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Twenty-three seconds&mdash;that was how long before the zombie would reach them and launch its attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Staying calm, Alexander gently pushed the sleeping Sally aside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sally rubbed her eyes groggily, only to see a zombie rushing toward them with its claws extended. The sight jolted her fully awake, leaving her frozen in terror.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Sally was about to scream, Alexander grabbed his machete. Despite being shirtless, he strode confidently toward the zombies without a hint of fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The morning sun cast its golden rays on Alexander, highlighting his muscular physique with an almost ethereal glow. His tall, powerful frame and steady stride left Sally completely mesmerized.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was like a god.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A zombie lunged at Alexander, its razor-sharp claws aimed straight at his chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In one swift motion, Alexander severed both its arms with a single stroke of his blade.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, Sally's screams pierced the air, making Alexander's heart skip a beat. Had a zombie gotten to her?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he turned to look, he saw her running circles around a parked bicycle, completely naked, with a limping zombie hobbling after her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The undead creature dragged its mangled leg as it chased her, but Sally was too quick. She dodged and weaved with surprising agility, and the crippled zombie couldn't lay a finger on her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, Alexander sensed movement behind him&mdash;the whoosh of air carried the zombie's putrid stench.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without even looking back, he swung his machete in a powerful arc.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The zombie behind him split clean in half, crumpling to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In one fluid motion, Alexander hurled his machete at the limping zombie pursuing Sally.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After the zombie attack, neither of them felt like going back to sleep. They sat up and lit a campfire to make breakfast.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The firelight cast a warm glow on their faces as Alexander casually sharpened his machete with a stone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sally stared blankly into the flames, her body still trembling from their earlier encounter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander glanced at her from the corner of his eye with a slight smile but said nothing, focusing on honing the blade.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The only sound between them was the crackling of burning wood in the fire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander," Sally suddenly broke the silence, her eyes filled with fear, "do you think we're going to die?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, everyone dies eventually," Alexander replied without hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't want to be eaten by zombies." Sally looked at him pleadingly. "And I definitely don't want to turn into one of those monsters. Can't you protect me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Look, I can't protect you forever," Alexander said firmly. "When it's time for me to go, I'm going."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sally's expression darkened, a hint of despair creeping into her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let me ask you something," Alexander countered. "Do you really want to live forever?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sally froze, confused by Alexander's words. Of course, she wanted to stay alive, but without his protection, she had zero confidence in her survival. Three days seemed like a stretch, let alone any longer than that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you want to survive in the long run, you'll have to rely on yourself," Alexander said calmly, his eyes fixed on her. "Only by building your own strength can you secure your future."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Rely on myself?" Sally stared at him in shock and confusion. "But I... I don't know how to do anything..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then, I'll teach you," Alexander said firmly, his expression deadly serious. "Starting right now, you need to forget this idea that you're helpless. You're not some delicate flower anymore. You're going to become a warrior."</span></p><div class="pagination">
