  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wait here," Alexander ordered, striding toward the dark passage. "I'll check for any threats inside."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Watch yourself in there, Alexander," Quentin called after him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though they knew Alexander was a total badass, he was still on edge. After all, this was the Sakra Society's secret base. Who knew what kind of nasty surprises they had stashed away in there?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander just flashed a smile and waved off their concerns as he stepped inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The secret passage was pitch black, but that didn't slow Alexander down one bit. His eyes adjusted instantly, taking in every detail of the tunnel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hadn't gone more than a few yards before he'd already stopped three times to disable deadly traps.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One wrong move from any unlucky intruder would've triggered a barrage of gunfire or set off an explosion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The tunnel spiraled down like a corkscrew, with Alexander following the stairs deeper and deeper underground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After descending about </span><span>65 feet</span><span>, he finally hit the bottom. A heavy-duty blast door made of reinforced steel blocked the way forward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Motion sensors picked up his presence, and fluorescent lights flickered to life overhead, flooding the space with harsh light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he approached the door, a keypad lit up automatically, waiting for input.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander ran through the code in his head before punching in each number carefully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stayed alert the whole time, ready for anything to go sideways.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A series of mechanical clicks echoed through the air as the steel door slowly slid open.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander let out a breath he hadn't realized he'd been holding. Sure, he could've used his Lightsabers to force his way in if the code hadn't worked, but that might have triggered the self-destruct sequence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everything inside would've been destroyed, and the whole mission would've been for nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once the door was fully open, Alexander did a quick sweep of the room. When nothing looked out of place, he stepped inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The secret chamber was pretty small, maybe </span><span>a dozen square meters</span><span>, and practically empty except for a lit-up temperature-controlled cabinet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inside the cabinet sat a few vials filled with reddish liquid.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander couldn't help but grin. These had to be Sakra Society's enhancement drugs. One of them might even be the pure Immortality Serum they'd been looking for.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If they could get these to their research team, they might finally crack the code on eliminating the serum's nasty side effects.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander radioed Quentin to join him downstairs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Quentin made it to the chamber and spotted the vials, his face lit up like a kid on Christmas morning. This raid had definitely paid off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, you've really hit the jackpot here. If this really is pure Immortality Serum, we might be able to develop an antidote," Quentin said excitedly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then even if Yinson creates more zombies or those living dead, we'll have a way to cure them&mdash;maybe even prevent it altogether." He was practically bouncing as he clapped Alexander on the shoulder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While they were talking, Alexander spotted something interesting&mdash;a hidden safe tucked away next to the cabinet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When they cracked it open, they found it packed with gold bars. There had to be at least a few dozen of them, worth a small fortune.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander," Quentin piped up, "why don't you keep these gold bars off the books? Consider it a bonus for helping us out."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander picked up one of the bars with a slight smile, testing its weight. Each one felt like it was about 2.2 pounds of pure gold. A few dozen bars of gold would fetch a pretty penny, but money was the last thing he needed right now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tell you what, Sir Thompson," Alexander said. "How about we trade these gold bars for some weapons and ammo to send to Treasure Island?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quentin hesitated, his expression turning serious. "Alexander... do you really think Yinson's 'Apocalypse Project' has a shot at succeeding?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We'll definitely find a cure. Yinson's 'Apocalypse Project' is bound to fail."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander didn't argue. Instead, he replied with a serious tone, "Sir Thompson, if we </span><span>had more people like you in the top brass, Yinson would definitely go down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But you know what's been happening lately. More and more bigwigs are banking on Yinson's Immortality Serum. They're scared of death. They want to live longer, to cheat the clock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's why I think Yinson's plans won't just </span><span>fail</span><span>. They're going to speed up."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quentin couldn't argue with that. Sure, this raid had been greenlit by military command, but it had faced massive pushback. The officers pushing for this operation were just a small group. Most of the brass wanted nothing to do with it.</span></p><div class="pagination">
