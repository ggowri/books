  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Oscar sighed, his expression a mix of concern and frustration, "Look, Mr. Hawthorne, I know you're capable, but you're outnumbered here. Theodore's come to Loscity fully prepared."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He gestured discreetly toward Theodore's sidekick.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"He used to be an unrestricted fighting champion. That guy with the scorpion tattoo."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander merely nodded, unfazed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Seeing Alexander's nonchalance, Oscar continued, "You really need to take this seriously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You should get out of here while you still can!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But Alexander remained calm. "Thanks for the heads-up, but I'm not leaving. When I decide to go, no one will be able to stop me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Oscar opened his mouth, momentarily at a loss for words. He thought this guy really had nerves of steel.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Oscar finally said, "Fine, but if Theodore tries anything, you can count on me to have your back."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander chuckled, knowing Oscar's motivations.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He thought, "He's mostly worried about what'll happen to his Parkinson's treatment if I'm not around, isn't he?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">They continued their conversation about the Brilliant Group and Theodore. Alexander found Oscar surprisingly insightful, with sharp opinions and a wealth of experience.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If only he could shed his air of superiority and disdain for others, he might achieve even more.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mr. Hawthorne! Sir Stewart!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Billy appeared, practically bouncing over to them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander had made it clear to Billy that they needed to keep their relationship under wraps, especially in public.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">So, Billy approached, bowing to both Alexander and Oscar with exaggerated enthusiasm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Oscar scoffed, his tone dripping with condescension.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What are you doing here? Since when does the Wolf Gang get an invite to such a high-profile event?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander watched Billy with keen interest; his presence was indeed unexpected.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">To ordinary folks, the Wolf Gang was a formidable force, but to the real players in the game, they were nothing more than street thugs, completely unworthy of attending an event of this caliber.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Billy grinned, puffing out his chest. "The councilor Mr. Federer is thrilled with the magic powder I provided, so he brought me along to help promote it!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Magic powder? You're selling that?" Oscar's eyes widened with excitement.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Billy beamed with pride, clearly enjoying the attention.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander raised an eyebrow, surprised that news of the magic powder had spread so quickly, even reaching Oscar's ears.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just as Billy was about to elaborate, Theodore stormed toward them, flanked by his men.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The tattooed guy kept his icy gaze locked on Alexander, his eyes brimming with menace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Watch yourself, Mr. Hawthorne," Billy warned urgently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander took a slow sip of his wine, acting as if Theodore didn't even exist.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With all eyes on him, Theodore stepped right in front of Alexander.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Alexander, who do you think you are? I didn't invite you here. Aren't you being a bit shameless?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander met his gaze with calm confidence. "Mr. Tate, did you forget? You sent an invitation to my girlfriend, Ava. She asked me to come in her place."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Theodore was momentarily speechless, caught off guard.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The tattooed man's expression hardened, a palpable tension hanging in the air as he glared at Alexander.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Their eyes locked, and it felt as if invisible blades were clashing between them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Oscar, sensing the escalating tension, stepped in to diffuse the situation. "Mr. Tate, every guest deserves respect. Treating a guest like this makes the Brilliant Group look petty."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Theodore shot Oscar a frosty glare. "Oscar, others might fear the Kaylon, but I don't. This isn't your turf, and I'm not talking to you, so keep your mouth shut."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Oscar's face flushed with anger as he pointed at Theodore. "Loscity isn't just the Brilliant Group's playground. You lay a finger on Mr. Hawthorne, and we'll have a serious problem on our hands!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Theodore hadn't expected Oscar to clash with him so publicly over Alexander.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Theodore declared with a smirk, "Well, it looks like the Kaylon and the Saint Group are truly allied. But what you don't realize is that I've already teamed up with Loscity's four great families, the eight major corporations, and sixteen influential forces.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Tonight, I'm hosting this dinner to let you witness the Brilliant Group's rise to dominance in Loscity!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He paused for dramatic effect and then confidently clapped his hands, silencing the room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Theodore continued, "We're offering our new product, 'Euphoria,' at half price to everyone here. The only condition is that you all join forces to drive out the Kaylon and the Saint Group from Loscity!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was a blatant challenge laid bare for everyone to see!</p><div class="pagination">
