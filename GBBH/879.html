  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matteo sneered in annoyance. "Hah! I'm not scared. What are you afraid of?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A little cash, and they think they can mess with me? This is </span><span>Kylaville</span><span>! Besides the Dragon Gang, who else should the Sakra Society be afraid of?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone around him nodded in agreement. It was true&mdash;only the Dragon Gang could rival the Sakra Society.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the yacht docked, Alexander and Norma stepped off hand in hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had already noticed Matteo and his group but paid them no mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matteo immediately led his men to block their way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Over twenty burly men in matching black suits stood like towering statues behind </span><span>Matteo, exuding an imposing aura.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smirked with disdain. "Still not convinced?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Norma's face darkened. They had let Matteo off once before, and yet he still had the nerve to cause trouble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After the shark incident, Norma's fury was barely contained. Without Alexander there, she shuddered to imagine how badly things could have ended for her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matteo pointed at Alexander and shouted angrily, "Don't get cocky, punk! Let me tell you, my dad's a senior member of the Sakra Society, and these guys are all part of it. Scared now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Scared? Why should I be? I've already taken out plenty of the Sakra Society. A few more won't make a difference."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander flashed a bright smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matteo froze, feeling chills despite Alexander's smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're all talk. If you don't hand over that woman, I'll break your arms and legs today and toss you into the sea to feed the sharks," Matteo shouted, trying to sound brave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matteo yelled loudly, trying to bolster his own courage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mentioning sharks only reignited Norma's rage. She lashed out, kicking him hard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Ahhh</span><span>!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matteo clutched his groin and collapsed to the ground, writhing in pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone was stunned. No one expected her to strike first.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once someone snapped out of it, they yelled, "What are you waiting for? Get them!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The group roared and charged at Alexander and Norma.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get out of my way!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander took them down one by one with ease, like a game of whack-a-mole. Each man either flew backward with a scream or crumpled to the ground, groaning in pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Over twenty Sakra Society thugs failed to even graze Alexander's shirt before being completely taken out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The dock was littered with bodies, and groans of pain filled the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Broken arms, shattered legs&mdash;at best, a fractured nose or missing teeth, blood gushing from their mouths.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The scene fell into a deathly silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander strode over to Matteo.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matteo lay motionless on the ground, pretending to have passed out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop playing dead!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander barked sharply, his icy tone making everyone shudder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matteo, facing Alexander directly, was so terrified he nearly wet himself. Shaking, he lifted his head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander stared at him with a blank expression, his cold demeanor resembling the Grim Reaper.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matteo no longer dared to fake unconsciousness. He broke into tears and begged, "Mr. Hawthorne... I was wrong... I really was. Please spare me! I swear I'll never show up in front of you again."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I let you off once, and you didn't know how to appreciate it," Alexander said, grinning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then he lifted his foot and stomped on Matteo's left knee.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Crack!&nbsp;A sickening crunch echoed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A series of shattering sounds followed, like a glass cup being crushed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Aaaah</span><span>!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matteo screamed in agony before passing out, convulsing on the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smirked and stomped on Matteo's right knee next.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Another bone-cracking sound echoed. Matteo no longer screamed, but foam spilled from his mouth as his convulsions intensified.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone else was paralyzed with fear. They had never seen someone so ruthless, someone who didn't even care about the power of the Sakra Society, crippling Matteo's legs in front of everyone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thud!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One of them, truly terrified, fell to his knees in front of Alexander, begging for mercy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne, please spare me... Give me another chance... I was wrong! It was all Matteo's fault&mdash;he forced us!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, it was all Matteo! He was the one pulling strings and forcing us to join. I honestly can't stand him&mdash;serves him right!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matteo's so-called friends burst into tears, bowing their heads repeatedly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They scrambled to list all the ways Matteo was horrible, desperately hoping to gain Alexander's forgiveness and be spared.</span></p><div class="pagination">
