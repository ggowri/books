  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With crystal-clear eyes, Alexander looked at Mary, clearly not intending to take advantage of her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In reality, her flirtatious look wasn't intentional&mdash;it was simply second nature. Once Mary realized their contact was unintentional, she brushed it off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To show her sincerity, she'd come without a driver or bodyguards, opting to drive herself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Alexander settled into the passenger seat, his gaze lingered on her long, shapely legs&mdash;deliciously tempting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Mary started the engine, Alexander decided to probe a little, saying, "I've heard the Blood Gang and the Cripples are getting chummy these days. Aren't you supposed to be sworn enemies?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instantly, Mary tensed up. A flicker of panic crossed her striking eyes; she hadn't expected that question from him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Noticing her hesitation, Alexander offered a slight, reassuring smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Relax, I'm just curious. With everyone joining forces with the Saint Group now, I wouldn't want you guys stirring up trouble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It could end badly for everyone, and there are more than a few folks eyeing the magic powder formula. Wouldn't want someone else making off with the loot."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mary felt a rush of emotions, wrestling with the implications of his words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had approached him under the guise of wanting help for her mother, but the truth was she wanted to get a better sense of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Didn't expect him to be this sharp and calculating. Seems like the Saint Group isn't without its defenses," she mused.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She suddenly let out a light, flirtatious laugh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne, I really envy Ava. You treat her so well&mdash;handing over the general magic powder's distribution rights to the Saint Group and still worrying about people like us for her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry, our relationship with the Cripples is purely business."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mary then took a meaningful glance at Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander chuckled back. Mary's use of the phrase "business" made it clear where she stood; as long as the stakes were high enough, she was all in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After the initial testing of their boundaries, the car fell into a comfortable silence as Mary focused on driving.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps it was the bumpy road or Bentley's exceptional suspension, but Alexander couldn't help but notice how her boobs swayed with every turn, creating a mesmerizing display.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caught off guard, he glanced a second too long, feeling a sudden dryness in his throat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mary was equally stunning as Betty, but the sultry allure emanating from her was intoxicatingly more intense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ever since he learned that having sex with women allowed him to absorb James' the Force more quickly, Alexander felt as if a devil had taken root in his mind, urging him to indulge in fantasies that every man harbored.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mary sensed his lingering gaze, a wave of discomfort creeping in, as if dozens of ants were crawling over her skin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought, "If he's interested in what's under this dress, maybe I could leverage that to get the magic powder formula."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her heart raced, and her cheeks flushed at the prospect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't long before the Bentley came to a halt in front of a private hospital&mdash;one of the most esteemed facilities for the wealthy in </span><span>Loscity</span><span>, boasting top-notch medical technology and an elegant environment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Alexander stepped out, he opened the door for Mary with a gentlemanly flair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Whoa!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as she was getting out, Mary unexpectedly stumbled, toppling straight into Alexander's embrace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instinctively, he wrapped his arms around her, his hands brushing the sumptuous curve of her rear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't help but notice the absence of any </span><span>panty</span><span> lines; she was either going commando or in a tantalizing thong.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mary's face flushed crimson as she shot him a sideways glance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Be careful not to fall," Alexander said softly, his voice laced with warmth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mary momentarily froze, dazed by his concern, transported back to her college days when her husband used to speak to her like that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her heart pounded fiercely in her chest, a mix of nostalgia and excitement weaving through her veins.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't until Alexander gently tapped her shoulder, checking on her, that Mary snapped back to reality.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, I'm fine! Just... thinking about the past. Let's go!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quickly, she stepped forward to lead the way, a single tear sliding down her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mary thought, "Laird, he reminds me so much of you... I hope you're resting in peace up there..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mary guided Alexander to the door of a hospital room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inside, an emaciated old woman lay in the bed, connected to a ventilator and various monitors, completely motionless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My mother is the only family I have left. She suffered a cerebral hemorrhage three years ago and has been like this ever since. She's been bedridden for three whole years now. The doctors say there's a chance she might never recover..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unable to hold back her emotions, Mary felt her eyes well up, and tears rolled down her cheeks.</span></p><div class="pagination">
