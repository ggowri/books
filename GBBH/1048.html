  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When they arrived at Aetheris Street, Rosalia frowned deeply. The area had developed too quickly in recent years, and everything had changed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had been here before on missions and had contacted Ariella, but now, everything seemed different. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She couldn't find anyone who could contact Ariella.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Alexander inquired about the situation of the Obsidian Gang by paying for information, they received unexpected news.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were told that the leader of the Obsidian Gang was dead</span><span>. A</span><span>nd Ariella, as the heir</span><span>ess</span><span>, was being hunted, her life hanging by a thread.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander and Rosalia hadn't expected this at all. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They </span><span>tried to </span><span>use the Obsidian Gang's power to find Hazel, but now it looked like they had to help Ariella first.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, Ariella was Rosalia's friend, and Alexander couldn't just stand by and do nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Besides, if Ariella took control of the Obsidian Gang, it would also be beneficial for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosalia felt uneasy upon learning that Ariella was forced to work as a barmaid in a pub.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne, you have to help Ariella. Please, I'm begging you!" she pleaded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry, I'll help her," Alexander reassured her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After hearing his answer, Rosalia finally relaxed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They checked into the best hotel on Aetheris Street and enjoyed a hearty meal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After dinner, Rosalia took Alexander to meet a relative.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You know quite a few people in Lumiria, aside from Ariella. I didn't expect your uncle</span><span> to be</span><span> here, too."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the way, Alexander and Rosalia chatted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, they arrived at a tidy neighborhood. It wasn't </span><span>rich people's zone</span><span>, but the environment was </span><span>not bad</span><span>, with lush greenery and beautiful scenery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosalia explained her uncle Malcom Sugarman's situation. Malcom and his wife were her only living relatives</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A</span><span>nd because of her connection to Ariella, she had helped them settle here, where they could be protected by the Obsidian Gang.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now that Ariella was in trouble, Rosalia wanted to check on how Malcom was doing. Alexander, of course, had no objection.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Having earned a lot of money as a </span><span>killer</span><span>, Rosalia had sent some of it to Malcom. From the neighborhood's appearance, it was clear that Malcom and his family were living comfortably.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosalia rang the doorbell.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The door opened quickly, and a white-haired old man appeared. He stared at Rosalia in shock before breaking into a wide grin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He grabbed her arm tightly and burst into tears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Rosalia, you've really come back! I haven't seen you </span><span>for</span><span> so many years</span><span>! </span><span>Why didn't you let me know you were </span><span>visiting me</span><span>? Come in, come in!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosalia's eyes welled up as she hugged him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is... my boyfriend, Alexander Hawthorne..." she introduced.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah! That's great!" Malcom exclaimed, enthusiastically shaking Alexander's hand</span><span>s</span><span> and pulling both of them inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come out and see! Rosalia</span><span> is </span><span>back! And she brought a handsome boyfriend!" he called.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Rosalia's back?!" A woman rushed out of the kitchen, and upon seeing Rosalia, she embraced her and started crying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander, watching the family cry tears of joy, felt deeply moved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come on, sit down!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll make you some coffee. What would you like to eat?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Malcom and his wife busied themselves, showing a great deal of warmth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Alexander smiled, he glanced over at the door, noticing a shotgun and a semi-automatic rifle leaning against the wall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Noticing that both of the guns were loaded, he couldn't help but think, "Is there a danger here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He remained alert but, after using his enhanced vision, saw nothing unusual. He felt that perhaps it was just for self-defense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, the sound of a baby crying echoed from upstairs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosalia froze for a moment. She knew Malcom didn't have any children.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She curiously asked, "Uncle Malcom, is someone else staying upstairs?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Malcom sighed deeply and plopped onto the sofa, his expression complicated as he began explaining.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is a complicated situation. It has to do with infighting within the Obsidian Gang. Some people from Risun arrived on Aetheris Street..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"People from Risun? Could they be from the Sakra Society?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that thought, Alexander and Rosalia exchanged a glance and felt their excitement rise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They hadn't found Ariella, but this was an unexpected lead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Three days ago, a woman holding a baby was being chased and happened to flee to my </span><span>house</span><span>. I couldn't just let her die, so I saved her," Malcom continued.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I thought about calling the police, but she wouldn't let me</span><span> do that</span><span>. She said there were traitors within the police, and if I called</span><span> the police</span><span>, both she and the </span><span>baby</span><span> would </span><span>die</span><span>."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Malcom explained the details of the situation.</span></p><div class="pagination">
