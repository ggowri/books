  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's instincts told him that these two opponents were formidable, and their teamwork was almost flawless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as he began to retreat, they suddenly accelerated, appearing right where he had just stood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A flurry of blinding blade flashes sliced through the air, barely missing him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The speed of both sides was astounding, and in the blink of an eye, they had already exchanged a move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wow!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two Shadow Warriors were astonished because they were the strongest in the team.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had thought that with their combined attack, Alexander would have no chance of evading, but he had easily sidestepped it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They felt a growing sense of urgency as his retreating speed was impressively quick, almost as if they couldn't keep up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The expressions of the other Shadow Warriors shifted as well. Despite being caught off guard, Alexander managed to dodge their strikes with ease.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it had been any of them, they would have already met their end.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two leading Shadow Warriors momentarily faltered, but their resolve quickly returned as they pursued Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The glint of their Kukri daggers flashed as they closed in on him again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, Alexander stood his ground, a smirk of contempt appearing on his lips. Clearly, he wasn't planning to retreat any further.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're asking for trouble!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two Shadow Warriors felt a surge of confidence, convinced that Alexander couldn't evade them this time. They could almost visualize him being torn apart by </span><span>their blades.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But as their sinister smiles appeared, their expressions changed drastically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Back away! Now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They shouted in unison, an instinct honed through life-and-death encounters.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But it was too late. Their attacks had been fully committed, leaving no room for retreat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, Alexander crouched low and struck at the gap beneath them with a fierce sweep of his leg.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The force erupted, making his leg feel harder than steel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Crack!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, two sharp sounds echoed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Shadow Warriors' calves were broken as they crashed to the ground, their daggers flying from their grasp.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they struggled to recover, Alexander appeared before them. He was holding a Kukri dagger, cold and merciless, resembling a reaper.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a flash of his blade, their heads rolled away, blood gushing from their severed necks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the two Shadow Warriors dispatched, Alexander scanned the remaining opponents.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Schroder was pale with fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The remaining five Shadow Warriors wore serious expressions, drawing their weapons.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The basement was crowded with dozens of people, and in the confined space, the lethality of their melee weapons was amplified.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They brandished daggers, knives, claw hammers, and even heavy chains, which swung threateningly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Attack!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander commanded as he focused on the Shadow Warriors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Augusta and Marvin charged toward Schroder, brandishing their swords and slicing through the chaos.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blood spattered as they cut down anyone in their path, quickly overwhelming Schroder and pushing him into a corner while rescuing Jane.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The five remaining Shadow Warriors did not intervene, their eyes fixed on Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite their numerical advantage, they felt intense pressure, as if each faced Alexander alone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Augusta and Marvin made their move, the tension rose even higher.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both Augusta and Marvin exuded the same energy as the others, clearly indicating that they were also Shadow Warriors who had used the power elixirs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their presence was even more intimidating and pure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thanks to Alexander's refinement of harmful substances from the power elixir, Augusta and Marvin gained strength that surpassed that of the others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The lead Shadow Warrior, a bald man, shed his shirt, revealing a muscular torso.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veins bulged on his arms, and his muscles were sharply defined, brimming with explosive power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Guys, we can't go back alive unless we kill him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The bald man swung his heavy hammer, rallying his four companions as they charged at Alexander like a pack of wolves.</span></p><div class="pagination">
