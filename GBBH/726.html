What do you want?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava stepped back, starting to panic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had seen that predatory look in men's eyes too many times before to mistake their intentions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Look what we have here! What a big tits and fat ass!" the thug sneered. "Come here, pretty thing!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The burly man lunged for Ava like a tiger going for its prey.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get away from me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava slapped away his hairy hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You dare refuse? Let me tell you something! We've already dealt with two households here. No survivors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We poor folks are ravaged by this plague, losing so many lives, while you rich folks go on living the high life. Why should you get to stay comfortable?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His buddies sneered in agreement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, why should you live so well? </span><span>You</span><span> parasites got rich by exploiting us!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dick, we don't often find someone this fine. We should all have our turn."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dick Payton gave a cold laugh. Though reluctant, he didn't want to dampen their enthusiasm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry, you'll all get your chance. But I'm going first," Dick assured his men.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava could see the hungry gleam in their eyes as she frantically tried to think of an escape route.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The security at her villa was tight, with Rosalia indeed guarding Ashley's door, but Alexander could be anywhere.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Back off! Stay away from me! You'll regret this if I call for help!" she shouted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dick wasn't intimidated. Instead, he burst into laughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They waved their weapons menacingly, sneering, "We've got the numbers and the guns. Who'd dare to challenge us? Even the police have practically shut down. You're dreaming if you think anyone's coming to help you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hold her down!" Dick commanded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Several men rushed forward, twisting Ava's arms behind her back and forcing a cloth into her mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Mmph</span><span>! He...</span><span>lp</span><span>!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava's muffled cries were barely audible as she struggled against their grip, but she was no match for their strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dick's face twisted into a cruel smile as he reached toward Ava's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ava felt sick to her stomach, overcome with despair.</span></p><div class="pagination">
