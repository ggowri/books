  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was too late for regrets now!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane's heart twisted like a knife when she thought about how Alexander had made at least ten billion dollars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If she knew Alexander had inherited hundreds of billions and was making tens of billions in profit each year, she'd probably jump off a building from rage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ken Lakers glared at Alexander. "He's your ex? Huh, if he's your ex, why would he help you?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Besides, the airport's locked down. Nobody can get on a plane unless they're airport personnel."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He smirked arrogantly, fixing Alexander with a challenging stare.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry, Jane. I'll make sure you and your mom get on that flight."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ken wrapped his arm around Jane right in front of Alexander, grinning smugly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The guy was clearly trying to show off in front of Alexander, flexing his masculine dominance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Men were like animals in the wild, always ready for a fight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He'd almost sealed the deal with Jane and was prepared to have some fun in his office.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But as soon as Alexander showed up, Jane got all nervous, which pissed Ken off and made him want to challenge Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Lakers, please don't..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane quickly dodged Ken's hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ken's face darkened instantly. He hadn't expected to be rejected so publicly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Jane, what's going on? We had a deal: you spend a few days with me, and I get you both on that plane. Are you backing out now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you two want to leave </span><span>Loscity</span><span> alive or not?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane's expression darkened as she bit her lip, remaining silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ken's face twisted into an unpleasant smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Better do as I say. Play nice, and I'll make sure you both get out of </span><span>Loscity</span><span> safely. Otherwise, you'll get infected: organ failure, tissue damage, the works."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane was at a loss for words. She couldn't bring herself to face Alexander in this situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Jane's compliance, Ken's smirk grew more confident.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's wrong with spending a few days with me? Afraid your ex-husband will interfere? He's just your ex! He has no right to stop you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If this guy tries anything, I'll have security teach him a lesson right away!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Ken bragged, he kept making unwanted advances toward Jane right in front of Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was both trying to provoke Alexander and satisfy his twisted ego.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While Alexander remained still, Charlize stepped forward and landed a sharp slap across Ken's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ken stumbled with a yelp of pain, one side of his face quickly swelling red.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You... you actually hit me? Do you know who I am? I'm the manager here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ken sputtered, holding his cheek in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The nearby security guards immediately rushed over after witnessing the incident.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why did you hit our manager?" they demanded aggressively.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The guards looked ready to pounce, their faces twisted with menace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Charlize cut in with an icy tone. "We're from the Saint Group. What exactly do you </span><span>plan to do about it? Are you looking for trouble?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Saint Group?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ken visibly trembled at those words, his face alternating between ghostly white and sickly green. He frantically signaled the guards to back off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two guards were already frozen in place, fear etched on their faces. They forced out an apologetic smile towards Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sorry, sorry! It's a misunderstanding, all a misunderstanding... We, uh, we need to get back to our posts."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They shot Ken a dirty look before practically sprinting away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ken bowed deeply to Alexander, practically folding himself in half. "I'm so sorry, I had no idea you were with the Saint Group. It was all a huge misunderstanding."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane watched the scene unfold with mixed emotions churning inside her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing that Alexander was no longer at the bottom of the social ladder made her feelings even more complicated. She felt a bitter cocktail of regret and sadness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Alexander stepped toward Ken.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ken jumped like a startled rabbit, keeping his head bowed low in nervous anticipation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm sorry, I'm so incredibly sorry... Please be merciful... I was wrong. I promise I won't bother Ms. Fairfax anymore, and I'll make sure they get on that plane."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He kept apologizing profusely, trying to appease Alexander with apparent fear in his voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If I ever see you again, you'll end up as fish food at the bottom of the lake."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's voice dripped with murderous </span><span>intent,</span><span> his tone so cold it seemed to drop the temperature several degrees.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ken trembled violently, cold sweat soaking through his clothes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After delivering his threat, Alexander shot one last penetrating look at Jane before walking away with the two women.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Despite Jane's hopeful gaze following him, Alexander didn't look back once. He felt no attachment to this woman. He only felt disgusted.</span></p><div class="pagination">
