  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, Mr. Stern!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without hesitation, the driver pressed the gas pedal, speeding forward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's beat-up Toyota led, while the Cadillac </span><span>followed</span><span> him. The chase began under the night sky.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Catch up! Hit him!" Jimbo Stern bellowed</span><span>. H</span><span>is expression twisted with excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Boom!" The Cadillac's gas pedal hit the floor, rapidly closing in, aiming straight for the Toyota's rear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hahaha!" Jimbo wasn't scared&mdash;he laughed, his scar distorting into something monstrous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as the Toyota was about to get hit, it suddenly sped up and swerved right into a side road.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Cadillac missed, leaving the driver no time to brake.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's Toyota was already far ahead down the small </span><span>road</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it, you useless fool!" Furious, Jimbo kicked the driver out and took the wheel himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before becoming Drake's apprentice, he had a passion for street racing, often gambling in illegal car races.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The scar on his face was from one such accident when the car door nearly took half his head off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The narrow country road </span><span>witnessed</span><span> a high-speed chase.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's Toyota led, kicking up a storm of dust.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jimbo pushed hard, gradually closing the gap with his car's superior power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Normally, the Toyota couldn't keep up with the Cadillac's horsepower, but each time Jimbo got close, it would suddenly dodge, as if it had eyes in the back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A few times, the Cadillac ended up in bushes or hit small trees.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander had many chances to speed away, but instead, he'd stop, roll down the window, and wave at Jimbo, clearly taunting him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jimbo couldn't stand this blatant insult.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, I swear I'll catch you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He'd just recently become a gray wizard under Drake and was feeling on top of the world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But being humiliated repeatedly was too much. Jimbo was desperate to catch Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't understand how, with his excellent driving skills and a powerful Cadillac, he couldn't even graze the old Toyota's bumper.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Something's off! Is Alexander using magic?" He couldn't help but wonder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You won't keep this up. I'll catch you!" Jimbo roared, furiously slamming the gas pedal. The Cadillac sped up again, aiming straight at Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, Alexander turned his car around, charging at him</span><span> face to face</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jimbo's face turned pale. "Is he crazy, going for a head-on collision?</span><span> He wanted to die with me?</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a panic, Jimbo swerved, but Alexander's Toyota slammed into the Cadillac's front corner.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bang!" In the violent crash, Alexander's angle had the advantage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Cadillac flipped over, spinning wildly, wheels in the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander stepped out, unharmed, and looked at his Toyota's battered front, sighing lightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This car had been with him for over four years. Its </span><span>end</span><span> had finally come, and he was a little sad to see it go.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn, Alexander, you're insane..." Bloodied, Jimbo cursed as he struggled to climb out of the wrecked car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was utterly furious at Alexander!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since becoming Drake's </span><span>student</span><span> and advancing to a gray wizard, he'd never suffered </span><span>like this, never been so humiliated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Run all you want, Alexander. Let's see where you can go now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You dared to crash into me? I'll make sure you beg for death, suffering the worst pain imaginable!" Jimbo shouted, pulling a black wand from the car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander looked at him calmly, unfazed by his rage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jimbo pointed the wand at Alexander, sneering. "Kid, I'm giving you one last chance. Hand over the magic powder formula and lift the curse on Sebastian and his son, and maybe I'll spare you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's eyes lit up. "Oh, so you're Drake?"</span></p><div class="pagination">
