  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's casual tone dripped with murderous intent. Like the Grim Reaper himself had shown up, sending chills down everyone's spine. Well, everyone except Cloe</span><span>&mdash;</span><span>she didn't even flinch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The men Rico brought with him weren't some average thugs. These were his elite crew</span><span>&mdash;</span><span>hardened pirates who'd spent years wreaking havoc on the seas. With muscle </span><span>like that backing him up, Rico figured he could take on Alexander without breaking a sweat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, Rico was starting to realize he'd seriously miscalculated just how dangerous Alexander really was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're one tough bastard, I'll give you that," Rico roared. "But let's see how you handle this much firepower!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without missing a beat, he barked out, "Light him up! Take him down!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before the words even left his mouth, the air exploded with gunfire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Over a dozen of his men, plus the three snipers, opened fire simultaneously, determined to turn Alexander and Cloe into Swiss cheese.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hundreds of bullets cut through the air in a deadly web, closing in on Alexander from all sides.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Haha! Not so cocky now, are you..." Rico's triumphant laugh died in his throat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander and Cloe had vanished into thin air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How could anyone move that fast, especially while protecting someone?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rico's mind was still trying to process what he'd just seen when a bloodcurdling scream pierced the air. One of the snipers came crashing through the shed wall, blood everywhere.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before anyone could react, another scream rang out. The second sniper, along with the tree he'd been perched in, split clean in half. Blood gushed like a fountain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A second later, the third sniper's agonized cry filled the air as his body went flying, hitting the ground with a sickening thud. He didn't get back up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was only then that Rico realized half his men were gone</span><span>&mdash;</span><span>every single one who'd been holding a gun was now headless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The decapitated bodies lay sprawled across the ground in a gruesome display, twisted at unnatural angles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not even ten seconds had passed when Alexander reappeared before Rico, Cloe still held protectively in his arms. There wasn't a single drop of blood on him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're a monster! Stay... stay back!" Rico's voice trembled as he stumbled backward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two remaining henchmen rushed to shield him. Their faces were pale with terror, and their hands shook uncontrollably.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's display of power had made it crystal clear that they were dealing with someone beyond human comprehension.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was extremely dangerous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet these two still stood their ground in front of Rico, and their expressions were grim but determined.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One of the thugs, a big guy built like a linebacker, was already cracking under Alexander's intimidating presence. Gritting his teeth, he charged forward with his blade, bringing it down in a vicious arc.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The knife cut through the air with a sharp whistle, aiming straight for Alexander's head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thug had put everything he had into that strike</span><span>&mdash;</span><span>enough force to slice through a steel pipe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The blade was inches from Alexander's skull, but he didn't even flinch. The thug's </span><span>eyes lit up with savage glee.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Too slow," Alexander sneered, flicking his wrist casually.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A soft white light flashed, cutting through the thug's body in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The guy didn't even realize there was already a bloody gash across his waist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh shit!" he screamed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he tried to jump back, his body suddenly froze. Then, in a horrifically clean slice, his torso split in two, crashing to the ground in a spreading pool of blood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The other guy</span><span>&mdash;</span><span>a skinny dude who looked like he lived in the gym</span><span>&mdash;</span><span>completely lost it. He spun around and bolted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey, weren't you going to kill me? Why are you running away?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's foot slammed into the skinny guy's back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sound was sickening. The guy's spine shattered. His ribcage exploded forward, and his bones jutted through the skin as blood poured out. He hit the ground hard and passed out cold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll kill you!" Rico roared, backed into a corner. He launched into the air, aiming a vicious roundhouse kick at Alexander's head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The kick cut through the air with impressive force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is this all you've got? And you thought you could take Treasure Island?" Alexander sneered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While Rico might be exceptional among normal fighters, to Alexander, he was nothing more than an ant waiting to be crushed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander casually caught Rico's leg mid-kick.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let go! Let go of me!" Rico bellowed, struggling desperately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even with every ounce of strength he possessed, Alexander's grip remained like an iron vise, only tightening further.</span></p><div class="pagination">
