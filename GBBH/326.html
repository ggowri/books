  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Roman let out a deep sigh, a wry smile on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's a shame. After all the hard work I put into my master's degree, finally landing a job at </span><span>Tijuanea</span><span> Bank... If I get fired, my parents would be heartbroken. And honestly, no other bank would even consider hiring me after that."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, tears welled up in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander placed a comforting hand on his shoulder. "Don't worry, I'll do everything I can to help you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You helping me? Just don't gloat over my misfortune. I'm not counting on you for anything," Roman said, rolling his eyes, feeling like Alexander was mocking him on purpose.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander turned to Janus, his expression shifting to one of cold determination. "Get lost. I'll make sure you don't last another minute at </span><span>Tijuanea</span><span> Bank."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His confidence left everyone stunned, their eyes wide with disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only Madelyn seemed to believe in Alexander, her excitement bubbling over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Janus looked taken aback for a moment before a sinister grin spread across his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You think you can just hit me and walk away? I haven't settled the score yet. I'll make sure someone breaks your hands!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's voice was icy. "Since you refuse to learn your lesson, I'll show you what real consequences feel like."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he struck Janus squarely on the forehead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It felt as if a thousand tiny needles pierced Janus' mind. The Force was working.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it, are you trying to hit me again?" Janus roared, rage boiling over as he swung his fist at Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ow!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He suddenly clutched his head, shaking uncontrollably from the pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh God, it hurts! My head is splitting open..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Janus collapsed to the ground, cradling his head in his hands, howling in agony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It felt like countless needles were digging into his brain, driving him to the brink of madness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moments later, Janus was drenched in cold sweat, the stench of urine filling the air as he lost control of his bladder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm sorry! Please... don't hurt me anymore..." Janus cried, his voice breaking with despair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smiled, a glint of satisfaction in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Weren't you just saying you'd fire Roman and get someone to break my hands?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I was wrong! I was just talking nonsense! I swear I'll do everything to unfreeze the funds... please, just let me go!" Janus </span><span>begged,</span><span> his dignity shattered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander looked down at him, relishing the sight of Janus' pain and regret. It was a satisfying turn of events.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Madelyn and the others were wide-eyed, shocked at the strange power Alexander seemed to wield over Janus, who was now a quivering mess.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They couldn't help but feel a surge of joy at seeing such a scumbag getting his comeuppance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, Janus was convulsing on the ground, foam bubbling at his mouth, completely unconscious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only then did Alexander casually pat Janus on the head, the invisible Force in his mind temporarily subdued.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Janus suddenly felt a rush of clarity, a mix of joy and terror flooding through him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wait... you... you can use magic? I'm sorry! I didn't know you were a wizard!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The room fell silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Roman and Avery were speechless, and even Madelyn stared at Alexander in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Alexander's unyielding expression, Janus broke out in a cold sweat, terrified of experiencing that hellish pain again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Please forgive me! I made a mistake... I'm not a person; I'm a jerk! I'm not human!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he berated himself, Janus slapped his own face hard, the sound echoing in the quiet room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His cheeks quickly turned red and swollen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's enough!" Alexander waved his hand, clearly annoyed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He added, "I'll give you two days. If you don't unfreeze those funds, you can expect a living hell."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes... yes! I promise I'll make it happen..." Janus stammered, desperate to avoid another round of torment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The pain he just endured was worse than anything he could have imagined.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This place is disgusting. Let's find somewhere else to eat," Alexander said, beckoning to Madelyn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The three of them snapped out of their daze and hurried to follow him out of the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Avery and Roman were both in awe of Alexander's mysterious abilities, carefully keeping a step behind as he and Madelyn led the way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Dukes, is that you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Madelyn furrowed her brow; how did this guy know her number?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Price, I've consulted with Mr. Myers, and I've managed to arrange a meeting. But Mr. Myers is very busy and doesn't like too many people around; can you come alone to discuss this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Owen's words made Madelyn feel elated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Madelyn felt a bit worried, she believed a mere supervisor wouldn't dare to lie in Mr. Myers' name. It must be because Mr. Myers has a special status that only she could meet him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without further thought, Madelyn quickly tidied up and prepared to go to the appointment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She also left a message for Avery, just in case.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Avery and Roman were both stunned by Alexander's magical skills. They carefully lagged behind Alexander and let him and </span><span>Madelyn walk</span><span> in front.</span></p><div class="pagination">
