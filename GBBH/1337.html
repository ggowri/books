  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finn was ecstatic when he saw Alexander suddenly halt. With a quick push off the ground, he leaped into the air, his right palm glowing with energy. A thunderous crack echoed as he unleashed a powerful Smashing Palm to strike Alexander's back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment the blow landed, Alexander felt the vortex of Force inside him whirl chaotically, the spiraling energy surging down to his feet and propelling him forward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Finn's fierce palm connected, Alexander took off like a bullet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Baylor, witnessing the impact, was thrilled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But in the blink of an eye, Alexander accelerated, slipping through the gap between Baylor's fists like a bolt of lightning and crashing into Baylor's chest. Baylor coughed up blood and collapsed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was aware of Baylor's formidable skills; the last time they fought, it had taken him three solid hits to break through. Now, his only chance for survival was to turn the tables by using his opponent's momentum against him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finn, infuriated by Alexander's unexpected comeback, gathered his protective energy, forming a faint barrier around his palms. He rocketed behind Alexander, palms thrusting forward with the force of a millstone, sending Alexander flying over a hundred feet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Alexander soared through the air, blood spewed from his mouth. Every meridian felt like it might snap from the pain, and his back throbbed intensely. Without the Force enhancing his body and the protection of the gold-threaded robe, he surely would have died.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In his moment of peril, however, the golden energy on Alexander's chest stirred, releasing a wave of intense warmth that coursed through him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finn, seeing Alexander hit the ground, felt his anger diminish slightly, somewhat impressed that the level-two warrior had managed to withstand two of his palm strikes. However, as a level-three warrior, he couldn't stand being used.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He approached, intent on claiming Alexander's head as a trophy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander, who lay on the ground feigning death, felt the warmth of the golden energy surging through him. The hot current and spiraling force coursed through his meridians and muscles, making his body swell as if it were on the verge of bursting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It felt like a blessing in disguise, as he was poised to break through to the rank of a level-three warrior at any moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finn flipped Alexander onto his back. He was startled to find Alexander looking back at him with a mischievous glint in his eyes&mdash;clear and very much alive. Panic surged through Finn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before he could react, Alexander intercepted Finn's shin with a powerful kick. Caught off guard, Finn stumbled back, momentarily shaken.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seizing the opportunity, Alexander propelled himself off the ground, springing up. His legs flew through the air, unleashing a relentless barrage of kicks at Finn's chest and abdomen, each strike faster and more ferocious than the last.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finn, stunned by the sudden assault, was forced to retreat, his eyes flashing with fury. Drawing on his protective energy, he grabbed hold of Alexander's right leg and tightened his grip before tossing him violently to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The impact was thunderous, creating a deep crater.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's body smashed into the pit, and blood spewed from his mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finn reveled in his triumph, thinking, "He had the audacity to challenge me, a level-three warrior. How foolish!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He slammed Alexander's body against the ground again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Alexander felt something shift within him. As he was battered, a rush of scorching golden energy surged from his body, merging with his spiraling Force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finn, momentarily distracted, noticed Alexander's strange smile&mdash;bloodied yet triumphant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finn felt inexplicably frightened, thinking, "Is he crazy?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, Finn felt a numbness in his right hand, and before he realized what was happening, he lost his grip. A sensation of metal breaking and stone cracking filled the air, and a dark figure loomed before him. The thought struck him, "Level-three warrior."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A sharp pain shot through his head, sending him flying backward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander had executed a swift whip kick, his heart racing with exhilaration&mdash;he had finally ascended to the rank of a level-three warrior.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a triumphant roar, he felt the Force inside him whirl and erupt, a powerful protective energy enveloping him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His right palm shimmered with a vibrant green aura. He reached out, grabbing Finn mid-flight and yanking him back toward him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As Finn flew back through the air, Alexander lowered his stance, coiling like a spring. He twisted his body, releasing the spiraling Force as protective energy, and launched a fist directly into Finn's waist, determined to turn the tide of battle once and for all.</span></p><div class="pagination">
