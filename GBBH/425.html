  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander waved his hand casually, igniting pale flames on two corpses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since becoming an intermediate Warrior, the power of the Force had intensified, and even from inside the car, Betty could feel the overwhelming heat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The flames illuminated the dark street, and soon, the bodies were reduced to ashes, swept away by the night wind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Betty was momentarily stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't until Alexander got into the car and wrapped his arms around her that she snapped back to reality.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Boss, I feel like you're getting stronger," Betty said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was like the most obedient little cute cat, curled up in Alexander's arms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The car was filled with a warm, sweet atmosphere, tinged with an unusual romantic quality.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Betty's unique fragrance filled the space, making Alexander's heart race.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gradually, the atmosphere became charged.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander found himself caressing Betty's waist and butt, lost in the moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What are you doing?" Betty asked playfully, her cheeks flushed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander unbuttoned her bra, exposing her breasts. His breath quickened with desire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The smooth, beautiful back and the plump and round buttocks presented a perfect arc. Alexander's eyes widened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Betty turned off the lights in the car and turned on the music. The dim light and soft music heightened the intimacy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Women really know how to create romance," he remarked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander licked his lips and admired the charming beauty in front of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her figure was really amazing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They leaned closer together, sharing whispers and stolen kisses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Betty closed her eyes and kissed his cheeks, neck, and ears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander couldn't wait to spread open her legs...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Betty screamed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In less than a few minutes, her snow-white buttocks contracted vigorously, and an electric shock-like feeling spread throughout her body. She clasped Alexander's shoulders tightly...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Alexander returned home, he found Ashley already asleep, softly snoring.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, Ava emerged from the bathroom, wrapped in a white towel, her figure alluring.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Look, this is our new beauty cream sample," she said, revealing a small green bottle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Intrigued, Alexander opened it to find a glimmering, exquisite cream inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Have you tried it yet?" he asked with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava blushed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I was just about to. Does it really enhance breasts and improve skin?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let me apply a bit for you. It works best with a massage. This scar on your hand will soon fade away."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander had long discovered that Ava had a small scar on the back of her hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He dipped his fingers in some ointment, gently applied it to Ava's hand, and began to massage it with the Force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, Alexander held Ava in his arms, and his warm breath sprayed on Ava's pretty face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava's body trembled slightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is a scar I got when I was very young. It should be difficult to remove."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava still found it a little unconvincing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, after applying this ointment, she felt an extremely cool feeling penetrated into the skin, which was very comfortable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, the scar began to fade.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava rubbed her eyes hard, shocked at what she saw.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is incredible!" Ava was absolutely thrilled, turning her hand over and over to admire it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not only had the old scar faded significantly, but her skin had also become soft and smooth, like a baby's, with an incredible texture.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This effect is absolutely amazing! It could definitely make a lot of money. No wonder even Mr. Thompson's daughter is interested!" Ava marveled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had tried the most high-end skincare products, no matter how prestigious or expensive, but none compared to the cream developed by Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, her cheeks flushed as she glanced at her chest and quietly asked, "Does this really enhance cleavage and prevent sagging?"</span></p><div class="pagination">
