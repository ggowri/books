  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ava immediately called Alexander, who, of course, agreed right away and rushed over to the company.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Meanwhile, at the entrance of the Brilliant Tower, a group of people had arrived at the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dozens of black Cadillac blocked the entrance completely, preventing anyone from entering or leaving.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>More than a hundred people stepped out of the cars and confronted the Brilliant Group's security.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The situation unfolded quickly. Only a handful of security guards were present at the building entrance, and they were at a severe disadvantage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>People started whispering who had the guts to stir up trouble like this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, normally, no one dared to act so recklessly in front of the Brilliant Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Skyla glared at the gold-lettered sign of the Brilliant Group, then waved her hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Smash it!" she ordered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The burly men behind her charged forward, shoving the Brilliant Group's security.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Stop! What do you think you're doing?" Ava shouted as she quickly walked out with firm and commanding voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Malakai and Ramona followed her. As soon as they saw Skyla and Arlene, their faces instantly darkened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"That's Felix's mother, Skyla Vanderbilt. The one next to her is Arlene Vanderbilt, the daughter of the head of the Vanderbilt family," Malakai whispered in Ava's ear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Skyla sneered, her eyes fixed on Malakai. "Malakai, I didn't expect you to give up your son's life so easily. What a cold-hearted father you are! You deserve to die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Malakai gritted his teeth and retorted fiercely, "Skyla, did you poison my son? How could that even the witches from City of Sorcery couldn't cure him, but you can?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Skyla smirked, her eyes full of malice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Malakai, since you refuse to follow my orders, I'll make your son suffer. I wonder if you can be tolerant to see your son in agony."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You bitch! I'll kill you!" Malakai screamed, ready to rush at her, but Ava stepped in to block him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ava glared at Skyla, her voice cold as ice. "This is Loscity, not Capital Region. You'd better watch your step here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"We'll protect the Valdez family. If you have something up your sleeve, show it to them."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Skyla snorted in disdain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Think again before you speak to me like that. Being Alexander's woman doesn't give you the license to be disrespectful. You don't have the right to talk to me. Hand over Alexander. I'm here to challenge him!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Since Alexander killed my son, I'll kill him. If he refuses the challenge, I'll poison everyone around him, one by one."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With that, Skyla waved her hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone saw a cloud of black smoke descend on two of the security guards nearby.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before they could react, the black mist enveloped them. They screamed in agony as they collapsed to the ground, writhing and convulsing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Their bodies began to rot, emitting a foul and black liquid.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The horrific scene sent everyone retreating in fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You are seeking death!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>One of the guards drew his gun and aimed at Skyla, but before he could fire, the black smoke had already enveloped him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The guard clutched his face, now decayed, and fell to the ground with a terrible scream.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Skyla sneered, her invisible aura crushing the onlookers like an unyielding mountain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ava's expression changed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Charlize stepped forward, placing herself firmly between Ava and the chaos.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Charlize had taken the power elixir and learned Alexander's basic meditation techniques. Her strength had reached the level of a third-tier metahuman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Skyla narrowed her eyes, staring Charlize before sneering, "You can't stop me. Call Alexander out, or you'll all die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At that moment, a huge crowd had gathered, all eager to see what was going on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Brilliant Group was a top-tier organization in Loscity, so everyone was curious about who dared to cause trouble there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Just then, a convoy of luxury cars sped toward them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was constituted with Rolls-Royces, Bentleys, Maybachs, BMWs...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>One after another, they all streamed toward the entrance like rivers flowing into the sea.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Damn! Who dares to act up in Loscity? Who dares to challenge Mr. Hawthorne? They're asking for death!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A sharply dressed man with a buzz cut jumped out of a Bentley, followed by a group of burly men in black. Their menacing pace spoke of danger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"That's Fairchild Torres, the head of Savage Tiger Clan. Savage Tiger Clan is the top gang in Harmocia. What's he doing in Loscity? I heard he's filthy rich, worth billions of dollars."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Fairchild is here to try to curry favor with Mr. Hawthorne. He's terminally ill, and I hear Mr. Hawthorne is a genius healer. He's come to beg for Mr. Hawthorne's help!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>People whispered among themselves.</span></p><div class="pagination">
