  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lower the gun, or I'm taking action," Alexander said calmly, his tone unwavering.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Son of a bitch! You're in my house, with my gun pointed at you, and you think you can just waltz in and </span><span>do</span><span> something? You deserve to die. And once you're out of the way, this woman's all mine... Hahaha!" The man cackled like a madman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander sighed, "Looks like this guy's lost it. No point wasting time with a lunatic."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before the words were even out of his mouth, Alexander delivered a powerful kick that sent the man flying like a human cannonball.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He crashed through the door and landed hard on the ground, spitting up blood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hands up! Now the gun's pointed at your head. Move even a little, and you're dead meat," Sally snapped, quickly grabbing the gun and pointing it at the fallen man's skull, mimicking his earlier stance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Please... don't eat me... If you're gonna eat me, at least let me eat first... Make sure I'm full so you can get your fill too..." the man begged between sobs, his voice trembling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Eat you? What on earth are you talking about?" Sally rolled her eyes, clearly baffled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's expression darkened. He lit a torch, and the warm orange light bathed the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man looked to be in his forties, his hair already graying, and his face carried an air of grim melancholy. There was something about his cold, haunting presence that made him feel even more unsettling than a zombie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It had been over two weeks since the crisis began.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if this man had stored food at home, it would've run out long ago. And for most people, the idea of stocking up hadn't even crossed their minds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, oddly enough, despite his constant pleas about being hungry, the man wasn't emaciated. In fact, he was almost overweight, his belly still bulging with layers of fat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Give me some food, please... If you're going to eat me, let me die full..." he begged, his voice cracking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander pondered for a moment, then gestured for Sally to toss him a pack of MREs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The middle-aged man fumbled with the package, tearing it open with desperate hands. He wolfed down the contents, chowing down so quickly that he started choking, his eyes rolling back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander watched him coldly, a flicker of unusual malice dancing in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sally remained silent, observing quietly from the side.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without Alexander's help, she knew she could've ended up in an even worse situation than this man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man devoured the MRE in what felt like the blink of an eye, his hunger consuming him entirely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Please, can I have more? Before you kill me, give me something to eat!" the man pleaded, his voice laced with desperation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's brow furrowed as he suddenly asked, "Have you been eating people?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man's eyes darted around nervously. "I... no, I haven't!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But you have. That's why you look so plump despite the shortages. You've been feasting while others starve." Alexander's tone was as cold as ice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sally shuddered at Alexander's words and instinctively took a step back, distancing herself from the repulsive man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ha! So what if I have? I wasn't about to let myself starve to death. There's nothing left to eat out there&mdash;just those monsters everywhere. Who's to blame me for that?" The man cackled maniacally.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What have you been eating?" Sally's voice trembled with a mix of anger and horror.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tears welled up in the man's eyes, but his next words were laced with hysteria.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I haven't eaten anyone! I haven't!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander had heard enough. This man was not just repulsive; he was downright sickening. He didn't want to waste any more time on this man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sally rebuked, her voice tinged with disgust, "What makes humans different from beasts is that we can kill our own kind, but we don't eat them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why didn't you fight like a man and search for food?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They're demons&mdash;unstoppable demons. It's God's punishment on us all!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man sobbed, his voice wavering between tears and laughter, one moment pleading, the next hysterical.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander sighed heavily, realizing the man was beyond reason.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He bound this man tightly with ropes and locked him in another room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After securing the madman, Alexander and Sally retreated to their own room, where they eventually drifted off to sleep, seeking solace in each other's arms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The following morning, Alexander released the deranged man, considering it too filthy to stain his hands with such a creature's blood. Let him serve as extra nourishment for the zombies; it was a fitting end.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the madman out of their immediate concern, Alexander started the engine of his vehicle and headed towards a designated underground air-raid shelter on his map.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>According to historical records, a vast air-raid shelter had been constructed in this area during World War II.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His next destination, however, was the heart of Kylaville, where he hoped to locate Norma. Given the dense population of zombies in the city center and the presence of evolved zombies, bringing Sally along would only be a burden.</span></p><div class="pagination">
