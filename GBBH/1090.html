  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Your dad? Like father, like son."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander gave a murderous smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He stepped on Jordan's chest and said coldly, "You have the shares of the Silver Shield Security, don't you? If you don't want to die, transfer all the shares to me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander gave Jordan a kick.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Write a gratis transfer agreement now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"No, I..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jordan looked around with fright. He didn't want to do that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He owned 20% of the shares of Silver Shield Security, which was worth nearly 30 million dollars. He couldn't give it away for free.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander chuckled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You want money instead of your life? Fine. Go to hell!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After he spoke, Alexander reached out and grabbed Jordan's neck again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jordan screamed with fright. He valued his life more than money, so he shouted, "Don't kill me. Please. Don't kill me. I'll write it right away."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Under Alexander's coercion, Jordan got up and began to write the transfer agreement tremblingly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Don't make any mistakes. If you make a mistake, you will die!" Alexander's words were extremely cold, which was like a bolt from the blue to Jordan's ears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You are ruthless."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As Jordan held the pen, he wrote and muttered, his forehead breaking out in cold sweat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If you say another word of nonsense, I'll cut off your tongue."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander stared at him murderously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jordan's heart was aching. He was going to give away the shares that were worth hundreds of millions of dollars for free.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It took Jordan more than ten minutes to write the short agreement and sign it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After that, he seemed to be drained of strength and collapsed to the ground with a blank look on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander picked up the agreement and read it carefully. He put it away and said with a smile, "Nice. Since you are so obedient, I won't kill you, but for the sake of your safety, you'd better be a fool."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jordan was shocked and angry. Just as he was about to scream loudly, Alexander slapped him on the head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jordan shuddered violently and then fell to the ground with a stupid expression, his mouth and eyes twitching.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You deserve it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander spat at him and went away calmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After he got into the car, Emma asked him anxiously, "Did you find them?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander nodded and said, "Yes. They are with Jordan's Dad Thomas. Let's go and settle the score with him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Emma said in surprise, "Thomas? He is not simple. He has close ties with the gangsters in Newbrook. I'm afraid it's not easy to deal with him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although she knew that Alexander was capable, she was a little worried.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Don't worry. Let's go."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander didn't take it seriously and drove fast in the dark.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A few dozen minutes later, Alexander parked his car in front of the door of a high-end club.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although it was late at night, the club was brightly lit and bustling with people.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander headed toward the door alone leisurely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before he even reached the door, he was stopped by several security guards.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"We only accept VIP members. Outsiders are not allowed," The bald security guard warned fiercely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"VIP members?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander waved his hand indifferently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Bang."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The bald man was sent flying away, and everyone present was shocked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before they knew what had happened, Alexander had entered the club.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Stop!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Several burly men rushed out from somewhere and surrounded Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>These people were burly built and had menacing looks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Judging from the calluses on their thick knuckles, Alexander knew they were a well-trained elite force of the club.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Who are you? How dare you to cause trouble here? You're seeking death."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>One of the big men pushed Alexander suddenly, roaring fiercely and murderously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Why are you barking at me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander cursed and launched an attack quickly, grabbing the heads of the two nearby men and slamming them together.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Bang."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The foreheads of the two big men were dented, and they fell to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before the remaining two could react, Alexander kicked them in the lower abdomen, and they fainted in the pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander continued to stride forward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At the end of the hallway, there was a grand door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A dozen bodyguards were standing at the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander headed straight to the door. He had seen everything in the room with his X-ray vision.</span></p><div class="pagination">
