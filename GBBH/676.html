  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander held her breast.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said, "Why don't you answer my question?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah! It hurts... I'll obey you... I'm sorry, Master..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beverly's tears flowed, and she quickly answered Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander grabbed her legs with both hands, spread them apart, and folded them against her chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beverly wanted to ask Alexander to be gentler, but Alexander had already penetrated her fiercely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander had no mercy on her and exerted all his strength, hitting Beverly hard with his lower abdomen every time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beverly was in pain and happy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's rude behavior made her senses become more sensitive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even the skilled Rosalia could only barely resist Alexander's attack. Beverly was not nearly as good as Rosalia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a while, Beverly could only beg repeatedly, fainted, and then was woken up again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander never thought of being gentle with her and continued to launch an offensive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>More than an hour later, Beverly fainted and lay motionless on the bed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at the delicate body covered with marks left by himself, Alexander was </span><span>content.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He sat down on the sofa leisurely and lit a cigarette.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander blew out several smoke rings, waiting for Beverly to wake up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After half an hour, Beverly was still sleeping soundly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander patted her shoulder. And the Force flowed into her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beverly woke up suddenly as if she had been electrocuted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Master... I fell asleep? I'm sorry. I shouldn't..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander lifted her chin with his hand and smiled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said, "Remember, if you dare to betray me, you will suffer the </span><span>most cruel</span><span> pain."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He activated the Force hidden in Beverly's body. And Beverly immediately spasmed in pain and began to roll around.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She fell out of bed to the ground, curled up in a rain of sweat. Soon, she was soaking wet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's control had never failed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beverly began to beg for mercy desperately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When she had suffered enough and wanted to commit suicide, Alexander relieved her pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said, "Remember, I am your eternal Master! From today on, you are still the head of the Weaver family. Work hard. Otherwise, you will die in pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As long as you behave yourself, I will help you suppress the pain, understand?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's cold words sounded like thunder to Beverly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The expression of this cunning woman changed constantly. Finally, she sighed and lay down at Alexander's feet, truly surrendering.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander revealed an evil smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had long seen through Beverly's thoughts. Beverly wanted to pretend to obey and then find an opportunity to escape. But now she was truly controlled by Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't even want to hypnotize her completely and control her will because it wasn't worth it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She said, "Master, don't worry. I will help you keep an eye on </span><span>Mandale</span><span> Town. If there is any abnormality with the Axe, I will report it immediately."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beverly was indeed smart. She understood that Alexander continued to let her control the Weaver family in order to prevent </span><span>Mandale</span><span> Town from being dominated by the Axe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander nodded with satisfaction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said, "Very good. As long as you do your job well, half of </span><span>Mandale</span><span> Town will be yours."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beverly was overjoyed. She had a strong desire for power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If she could get half the power of </span><span>Mandale</span><span> Town, she thought it would be worth it to be Alexander's servant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander said, "You are quite capable, having collected so many valuable antiques and </span><span>jewellery</span><span>. The total value of these items is no less than two billion dollars."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander gave her a little compliment, which made Beverly smile and feel very happy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Master, I will only obey your orders!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander said, "Okay, the first thing you have to do is to form an alliance with the Axe, control the gem trade in </span><span>Mandale</span><span> Town, and keep an eye on the Axe."</span></p><div class="pagination">
