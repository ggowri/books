From now on, you'll need to let me help you every month with your treatments, ensuring enhancements without any sagging."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come on! Don't try to trick me," Ava shot back, her face flushed with embarrassment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander sighed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Believe it or not, it's up to you; being a good person is tough."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once the treatment ended, he withdrew his Force and wiped the sweat from his forehead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although it was a rewarding job, using the Force was exhausting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava pressed her legs tightly together, trying to hide the wet spot on the sheets.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under Alexander's massage, she orgasmed twice, and she felt damp between her legs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Take a look at the results for yourself."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander pulled over a full-length mirror from the side.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, Ava's stunning figure reflected in the mirror, every curve accentuated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wow! I can see the difference!" she exclaimed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her eyes widened in shock as she swayed in front of the mirror, first lifting her rear and then checking her newly enhanced cleavage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The series of seductive poses ignited a fire within Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It really does look better! It feels like I'm back at eighteen. You're amazing!" she said, her gaze filled with longing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wrapped his arms around her waist and leaned in for a kiss, their tongues dancing together as they got lost in the moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava breathed heavily, instinctively clinging to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The earlier messages had already set the stage, and now that the spark had been ignited, they found themselves unable to control their desires.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Outside, unbeknownst to them, a shadow lurked, watching with wolf-like eyes, greedily focused on the scene inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander casually glanced at the shadow but feigned ignorance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His All-seeing Eyes had already detected an intruder&mdash;someone who wasn't targeting him or Ava but rather Ashley.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't help but smirk internally, knowing that Rosalia had been hiding in the shadows and had also noticed the intruder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps the intensity of Ava and Alexander's moment was too distracting, and Ashley's enticing sounds made it hard for the shadow to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After waiting for a while, the shadow slithered towards Ashley's room like a serpent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Its aim was to kidnap her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Alexander and Ava engrossed in their embrace, the intruder saw this as the perfect opportunity to make a move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, you bastard, just wait!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Andrew seethed with excitement as he crouched low, carefully avoiding detection.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He felt the moment was right and quickened his pace toward Ashley's room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as he placed his hand on the doorknob, ready to burst in with a drugged cloth to cover Ashley's face, a slender figure appeared behind him, eerily silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Andrew thought he was undetected, only to realize too late that Rosalia had crept up on him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Humph!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Startled, Andrew jumped at the sudden cold sound from behind him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he turned, Rosalia struck him on the neck, knocking him out instantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She swiftly bound Andrew with rope, effectively securing him like a package, stuffing his mouth with one of Alexander's socks to keep him quiet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then she waited quietly outside the bedroom, her eyes shimmering with hidden bitterness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing Ava's sultry moans from inside, she couldn't help but recall Alexander's impressive skills in bed, which made her squeeze her legs tightly together.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a long hour, the sounds of passion finally subsided.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moments later, Alexander strolled out, unhurried and composed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wah! Wah!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as Andrew spotted Alexander, he began to struggle fiercely against his bindings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's you? The Fairfax family keeps trying to take Ashley; there's clearly a conspiracy at play," Alexander stated coldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His gaze was steady on Andrew.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosalia pulled the sock from Andrew's mouth and positioned her katana against his neck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tell us, what kind of conspiracy are you planning?"</span></p><div class="pagination">
