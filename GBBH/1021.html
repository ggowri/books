  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ready to negotiate with the Nexura Group? Well, it's best if we can reach an agreement."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander nodded and then added, "The Nexura Group is unwilling to provide the raw materials, but I'll figure something out. Don't worry. This is a small matter. I can handle it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Fine, as long as you say so! But even if you're some kind of genius, you can't magically conjure up raw materials."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ava gave him a playful glare.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Don't worry. I've got everything covered!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander patted his chest confidently, and his eyes fell on Ava's curvaceous figure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At that moment, Ava crossed her arms over her chest, making her full and soft breasts even more eye-catching.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Especially with the top button of her white shirt undone, her deep cleavage was fully exposed, incredibly tempting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander couldn't resist pulling her close and kissing her deeply.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mm! I... I need to go to the office..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ava's face turned red, her lips blocked, and she stammered, unable to get the words out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"We'll go later. Let's enjoy ourselves for now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander chuckled, lifting Ava in his arms and striding toward the bedroom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ava gasped as Alexander tossed her onto the large bed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The buttons of her shirt popped open, and her alluring and full breasts bounced freely, radiating a wave of sensuality.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander, like a ravenous wolf spotting a tasty meal, pounced on her, eagerly devouring what he'd found...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon, soft and melodic moans drifted from the bedroom, rising and falling in a continuous, hypnotic rhythm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A middle-aged woman, her face slightly pale and her eyes darting nervously around, hurried down the ornate hall of the Vanderbilt Manor, situated in the heart of the bustling Capital Region.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her frame was slender, her steps unsteady, and her face tinged with a sickly pallor. It was clearly the result of grief and physical exhaustion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Vanderbilt family was the most influential one in Capital Region, with assets in the tens of billions of dollars and formidable strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Along the way, numerous guards and bodyguards kept watch. They only glanced at the woman, and no one stopped her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They knew she was Skyla Vanderbilt, the sister of the head of the Vanderbilt family, Gunter Vanderbilt, and the mother of Felix.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Gunter! I've found the killer!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Skyla yelled as she rushed toward the study door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What's going on?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gunter's calm and authoritative voice came from inside the study.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Skyla shuddered, her teeth clenched as she spat out, "Gunter, I've got reliable intel. Felix was killed by Alexander from Loscity on Treasure Island. You have to help me avenge him. Felix is your nephew!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The study fell silent for a long moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Just as Skyla was beginning to lose patience, Gunter's cold voice broke the silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Don't worry, I already knew. But Alexander isn't someone we can deal with recklessly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"In fact, I've already taken action. Come in, I'll explain what's going on with the Nexura Group..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Skyla's eyes lit up, and she quickly walked into the study.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Two hours later, a private jet took off from the airport.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Skyla sat comfortably in a large and soft seat, expressionless as she gazed out the window.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Beside her sat, there was a stunning young woman, around eighteen or nineteen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This woman was an absolute beauty, with striking features that resembled Skyla's.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even more striking than Skyla, she exuded an icy aura, like a goddess of the frozen mountains.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But her figure was incredibly seductive. She had full breasts, a slender waist, long legs, and smooth skin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her beauty rivaled that of Ava and Betty. Any man who laid eyes on her would be transfixed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Arlene, thank you for coming with me to Loscity to help me avenge Alexander."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Skyla's eyes were filled with hatred.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Arlene smiled slightly, a mischievous glint flashing in her eyes as she asked, "Aunt Skyla, with Alexander's power in Loscity, do you really think we can suppress him?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Of course. I'm going to challenge Alexander face to face, and he won't dare refuse."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Skyla's words sent a chill down Arlene's spine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Wait, Aunt Skyla, are you going to use witchcraft to challenge him?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Arlene was clearly taken aback.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Skyla smiled coldly. "I've been studying witchcraft for over twenty years, especially poison. In that area, I'm definitely not weaker than the white wizard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Even if he refuses my challenge, I'll secretly poison him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Skyla's expression twisted into a grimace of malice.</span></p><div class="pagination">
