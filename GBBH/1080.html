  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was the first to pull Emma from the car, removing the hood from her head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma, her face pale with fear, burst into tears and clung tightly to Alexander, sobbing uncontrollably.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her soft </span><span>boobs </span><span>pressed against Alexander's chest as she trembled</span><span>. Though she had a daughter, she was still a very sexy woman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander found himself in an awkward position, hesitant to push her away despite her tight embrace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom! Are you </span><span>al</span><span>l</span><span> </span><span>right?"</span><span> </span><span>Maxine ran over crying, also </span><span>hugging</span><span> Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They clung to him like ivy, as if he were their only anchor in the storm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Alexander looked at Emma and Maxine, lust rose in his heart. Because this mother and daughter were both </span><span>pretty and sexy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The hotel security finally shuffled over, looking at Alexander with a mix of awe and straight-up fear. They'd witnessed the whole thing, </span><span>and they were </span><span>impressed</span><span> by </span><span>Alexander</span><span>. This man </span><span>was an absolute beast in fight</span><span>s</span><span>!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These guys had the nerve to attempt a kidnapping in broad daylight&mdash;hardcore criminals, no doubt. Six of them, and Alexander had taken them down single-handedly like it was nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The commotion rippled through the entire hotel. A dozen or so security guards came rushing out, quickly securing the scene before calling the cops.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The police showed up in no time, drilling Alexander, Emma, and Maxine for details. But Emma and Maxine kept their mouths shut about what really went down</span><span>. T</span><span>hey were </span><span>afraid that</span><span> Silver Shield Security might do something to Alvin if they </span><span>told the police about the whole story</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander hadn't considered getting the police involved, brushing off questions by claiming he didn't know the kidnappers or their motives.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He booked three luxury suites at the hotel, one for each of them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ever since Alexander had stepped in to save them again, Emma couldn't take her eyes off him. Her </span><span>eyes were full of complex feelings</span><span>,</span><span> and nobody knew what she was thinking about now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Maxine was completely </span><span>attracted</span><span> by Alexander. Her delicate face cycled between secret smiles and shy </span><span>glances,</span><span> her eyes filled with pure admiration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We're all pretty sweaty from everything that went down," Alexander said. "Let's grab showers, meet up for dinner, and then I'll head to the Frenzy Bar tonight."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxine and Emma quickly agreed before heading to their rooms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When the three met up at the restaurant, Alexander couldn't help but stare.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma was a little poor just now after that mess. But she took a shower, and clearly put on makeup. Currently, she looked stunning, radiating the kind of beauty that explained where Maxine got her looks from.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Compared to Maxine's youthful charm, Emma possessed a captivating sophistication that attracted men more. Sometimes her charm could make a man go crazy for her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander led them to their table and started looking through the menu.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Around them, other men's gazes lingered, shooting envious looks his way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While Alexander was busy ordering, Emma leaned close to her daughter's ear and whispered, "Be honest with me, sweetie. Have you slept with Mr. Hawthorne?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxine's face instantly flushed red. "No... I </span><span>just met him the other day</span><span>," she answered awkwardly. "</span><span>He&rsquo;s not pursuing me</span><span>. He just wants Dad's technology."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma's brow furrowed as she muttered under her breath, "If Mr. Hawthorne </span><span>was</span><span> genuinely trying to help us, he could definitely save your father. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>But what I'm really worried about is&hellip; What if the Silver Shield Security offers him a piece of the cake? Then we'd be totally screwed."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom, what are you talking about? Alexander isn't that kind of person!" Maxine </span><span>refuted her mom&rsquo;s views </span><span>with a pout.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma let out a quiet sigh. Her daughter was still so </span><span>naive, no idea about the law of the jungle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Why would any man stick his neck out for strangers without getting something substantial in return?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The more Emma dwelled on it, the more anxious she became. If Silver Shield Security </span><span>offered </span><span>a deal with Alexander, their entire family</span><span> would be doomed</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander had finished ordering when his gaze drifted to Emma.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though she was Maxine's mother, her immaculate self-care made her appear only about a decade older than her daughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma noticed Alexander's eyes lingering on her figure, and her </span><span>heart beat</span><span> faster</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had deliberately dressed </span><span>up </span><span>to impress</span><span> this man</span><span>, with her blouse strategically unbuttoned to show off her curves. Her efforts hadn't</span><span> been in vain. S</span><span>he</span><span> managed to get</span><span> Alexander's attention.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He must be interested in me!"</span><span> Emma</span><span> thought excitedly, feeling a rush of warmth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She knew that winning a man's affection and commitment meant understanding his needs and making him feel </span><span>happy, satisfied</span><span>.</span></p><div class="pagination">
