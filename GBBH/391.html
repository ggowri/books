  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Early the next morning, Alexander took Ashley to preschool.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the preschool entrance, Alexander gently ruffled his daughter's hair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ashley, if anything happens, ask your teacher to call me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ashley nodded vigorously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Purnell, I'm back for class!" Ashley shouted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ashley ran toward a woman standing nearby.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ella was poised and graceful, with long hair cascading over her shoulders. She wore a fitted white dress accentuating her figure, and her long legs caught the eye as she walked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ashley had already run into Ella's arms, who laughed softly as she hugged her, a gentle, inviting fragrance lingering in the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Purnell, this is my dad..." Ashley introduced Alexander, sounding very grown-up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before she could finish, Ella pointed at Alexander in surprise. "Alexander, is that you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander blinked, recognizing her as his childhood neighbor, Ella Purnell. He hadn't seen her in over a decade. It was fate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ella, so you're teaching here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ella patted Ashley's head with a complicated expression and said, "Alexander, so Ashley is your daughter. I'll take good care of her, I promise."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thanks, Ella. Let me take you out for a meal sometime."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander thanked her and then turned to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, a Mercedes came speeding toward them, getting faster.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It drove straight at Ella and Ashley, alarming the people nearby, who screamed in panic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ella froze for a moment, and by the time she tried to grab Ashley and move, it was too late.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ella's face paled, and she immediately stepped in front of Ashley.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the blink of an eye, a figure rushed over, grabbing Ella and Ashley, leaping several miles away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bang!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Mercedes sped past where Ella and Ashley had been standing and crashed into a flower bed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was close!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ella was pale with fright, her mind blank.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander asked, concerned, "Are you alright?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ella snapped back to her senses, realizing she was pressed tightly against Alexander's chest, her face reddening as she noticed the closeness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you, Alexander. I'm fine... this is the second time you've saved me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ella remembered how she had almost drowned as a child, and Alexander had saved her. Now he had saved her again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, a heavyset woman with a smell of alcohol stumbled out of the car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who wrecked my car? Was it you? You're paying for it!" the woman shouted at Alexander, her face quivering with anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ella was furious. "Oh, it's you, Mrs. Powell! How could you drive drunk? You nearly hit us!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The woman looked Alexander up and down with disdain and said, "Ms. Purnell, you're exaggerating! It was obviously your fault, blocking my way and causing me to crash. This is a fifty-thousand-dollar Mercedes. You're paying up!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing her attitude, Alexander sized her up instantly. It's a woman with a little money who didn't know her limits.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why should we pay? Wait right here while I call the cops. We'll see what they say about your drunk driving and trying to shift blame."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander pulled out his phone immediately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The woman instantly deflated; drunk driving was illegal, and if the cops came, she'd end up in court.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She scoffed. "Look at you, broke and pathetic. Fine, I'll let it slide. Consider yourself lucky I'm so generous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Purnell, I'll cover the repair costs myself, for your sake."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander replied icily, "I was scared out of my mind. Maybe you should take me to the hospital for a thorough check."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The woman shrieked immediately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're trying to shake me down? You must not know who I am! I'm Mandy Summers!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander began dialing on his phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright then, I'll let the cops handle this."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mandy instantly backed down again, hurriedly pulling out a wad of cash from her purse and throwing it at Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Loser, isn't this what you wanted? Take the money and get lost!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander fixed her with a hard, piercing stare.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"For your kid's sake, since they're in class with my daughter, I'll let it go this time."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Turning around, he stuffed the cash into the nearby charity donation box.</span></p><div class="pagination">
