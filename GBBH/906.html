  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hazel gladly accepted everything the man did. No matter whether she was at home or school, she was always available at his beck and call without any complaints.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In just a few months, Hazel developed an inexplicable attachment to the man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But her pain stemmed from the man's numerous slave girls, with new ones frequently added.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hazel even served him together with several other girls.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking of the woman who had been favored by him recently, Hazel felt jealous and uncomfortable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hazel!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A familiar male voice came.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hazel stood up immediately, showing an excited expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Master, I have been waiting for you all night."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man was about thirty years old, tall and straight, with an evil aura emanating from his handsome appearance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Did you miss me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Master, of course I miss you. Have you forgotten that you haven't seen me for a month?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hazel knelt at the man's feet like a puppy, stroking his thighs and rubbing her face against them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This situation was simply unbelievable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The second young lady of the Walsh family was actually like a dog wagging her tail to beg for mercy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Master, do you want to abandon me because you have a new woman?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hazel acted coquettishly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man snorted coldly and suddenly kicked her away. "How dare you ask about my affairs?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hazel fell to the ground, begging for mercy with tears in her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Master, Master, please don't be angry. It's my fault. I didn't mean it. Please punish me. Use your penis to punish me severely..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hazel knelt on the ground, raised her round buttocks towards the man, and swayed seductively.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What a bitch!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Disdain and contempt flashed in the man's eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was tired of her. If she weren't the second daughter of the Walsh family, he would have sold her to the brothel long ago.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man smiled sinisterly and said, "Hazel, Mr. Hunter will come to punish you later, and you must serve him well. Your sister hurt his son, so he can only vent his anger on you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hazel shuddered with fear and said with a complicated expression, "Master, do you mean the old man, Kellen Hunter?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man nodded. "Yes, it is Mr. Hunter. You'd better be polite when you meet him. Otherwise, I can't guarantee that he will not make you suffer."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hazel turned pale with fright.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She could guess that Kellen must have come to avenge his son.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But did she have the ability to resist?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If she told her sister all this, how could she face the whole family? Everyone would gossip about her!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why? You dare not?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man grabbed Hazel's chin and stared at her viciously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're just a slave. Remember your identity. Whatever I order you to do, whatever man I order you to serve, you must do it wholeheartedly. Do you understand?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hazel burst into tears and nodded vigorously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Understood, Master. Don't worry. I will definitely serve Mr. Hunter well."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, good."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man nodded with satisfaction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, a man in black came running in, leaned close to the man's ear, and said, "A lot of people came over. It seems like they are from the Walsh family."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What? They came here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man's face darkened drastically, and he kicked Hazel to the ground, cursing viciously, "Bitch, why didn't you go home? Now you've attracted your family members here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hazel was kicked far away, but she immediately crawled over like a dog, knelt in front of the man, and trembled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm sorry. I didn't expect it to be like this..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hazel was panicked, uncertain if her distress stemmed from fear of abandonment of the man or her family's arrival.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man said coldly, "Forget it. Just come with me and hide."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then he waved his hand at his men and said, "I'll leave the rest to you. As long as there's no evidence, the Walsh family can't do anything to you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hunter will be here soon. Just hold on for a while!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, the man grabbed Hazel and picked her up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stupid woman, hurry up and follow me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man took Hazel and left quickly through the back door.</span></p><div class="pagination">
