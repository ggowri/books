  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Empowered by the black flames, the five figures in black surged with evil energy, stirring up an icy wind that chilled to the bone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rock sneered, "Not so tough now, are you? Let's see how you handle the flames of hell!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He unleashed his trump card, though it drained his life force to do so.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing the black-clad figures charging with lethal intent, Shadow shouted, "Attack together!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He, Rosalia, and Charlize formed a triangular formation and launched their counterattack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill them!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the forefront, Shadow let out a battle cry. His body suddenly expanded, muscles bulging until they ripped through his clothes. In a split second, he unleashed hundreds of punches.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His werewolf bloodline pushed to its limits, and his fists packed devastating power as they slammed into the first black figure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A thunderous explosion erupted from the point of impact between Shadow and his opponent. The shockwave rippled outward violently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The black figure at the front was completely obliterated, leaving nothing but scattered sparks falling to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shadow coughed up a mouthful of blood, his body swaying uncontrollably. He was clearly seriously wounded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though Rock's face remained expressionless, blood trickled from the corner of his mouth. The destruction of his shadow warrior had injured him as well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosalia and Charlize also went all out, each taking down one of the black figures.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sparks littered the ground like fallen stars, with only two shadow warriors remaining.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rock wasn't just bleeding anymore - he was hemorrhaging. Each fallen assassin took a devastating toll on him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>William, who was covering their rear, had lost all patience. His body became engulfed in a blood mist once again as he surrounded the two remaining assassins with it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The mist erupted with thunderous noise as black flames repeatedly burst through, only to be smothered by the crimson fog.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Another assassin fell to William's onslaught, leaving nothing but black sparks scattered across the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rock was losing his mind with rage. He'd never imagined that even after using his trump card, he'd end up so severely wounded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The last assassin managed to break free from the blood mist, but the black flames </span><span>surrounding him had grown dim and weak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Charlize let out a battle cry. "Time to end this!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her hands moved in a blur as she launched a barrage of throwing knives, each one finding its mark in the assassin's body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosalia followed up with her katana, executing a perfect cross-slash that quartered the assassin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even in pieces, the dismembered parts continued to writhe on the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>William shouted, "Go to hell!" and engulfed the remains in his blood mist. Within seconds, the assassin's remains dissolved into black sparks and vanished without a trace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Real fear gripped Rock now. Even if he fought with everything he had, he stood no chance against such powerful opponents working together.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is this how everything would end?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rock didn't waste another second. He turned and bolted toward the exit like a man possessed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His bulging eyes were wide with fear as his withered body moved with surprising speed, darting down the stairs like a cornered rat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone immediately took off after him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rock bolted ahead without looking back, quickly reaching the plaza.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He congratulated himself on his brilliant decision as he took in the scene around him. Bodies littered the ground, most of them members of the Red Umbrella Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blood had turned the ground into a slick red surface.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Catch him!" someone shouted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shadow's men quickly closed in, attempting to capture Rock alive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rock let out a cold laugh and swiftly opened the Ancient Grimoire. Black mist instantly materialized, spreading across the area.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When the group rushed forward, they found nothing. Rock had vanished into thin air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just missed him! That old fox got away!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shadow smacked his forehead in frustration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Alexander and Felix had begun their confrontation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander stood perfectly still while Felix circled him on all fours like a wild animal, moving at incredible speed and letting out inhuman growls.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a flash, Felix lunged upward, aiming his claws at the back of Alexander's head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His fingers were long and pale, with pronounced knuckles and jet-black nails that had grown several inches long, gleaming with a deadly sharpness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without turning around, as if he had eyes in the back of his head, Alexander casually swung his sword.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a sharp slicing sound, all ten razor-sharp nails were severed clean off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Felix barely managed to pull back in time. If he'd been a fraction slower, it would have been his fingers rather than just his nails.</span></p><div class="pagination">
