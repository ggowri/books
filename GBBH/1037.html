  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Morrison, I'm really troubled," Decker said, smiling as he sat down in his chair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm sorry... Mr. Payne, I won't do it again. Please, I know I was wrong. I promise I won't do it again,"</span><span> </span><span>Kiki pleaded tearfully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Payne, I can't lose this job. My father needs money for treatment."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kiki's eyes were filled with tears, and her panicked expression was heart-wrenching.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Decker couldn't help but laugh, thinking, "Kiki has fallen into my trap. She's so alluring. I must use her several times more and not let her go so easily."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Payne, I beg you, please forgive me this once. I'll do anything you ask. Just please don't fire me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kiki still didn't realize she had fallen into a trap.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is that so? You'll do anything?" Decker's wrinkled face was full of a sinister smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Morrison, you were fortunate to get this position. Although your father is sick and needs treatment, you did indeed violate the school rules. If others find out I didn't deal with you, I'll be in trouble."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Decker pretended to be troubled, thinking, "Since I've already pushed Kiki to the brink, I should give her hope and let her jump into the pit herself."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kiki saw a glimmer of hope and became excited.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Payne, what do you want me to do? Just tell me. I'll agree to anything. Just please don't fire me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kiki spoke earnestly and stood up to bow deeply to Decker.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her plump and full breasts slightly sagged, looking even more voluminous and enticing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, since you admit your mistake, follow my arrangement, and I might let you off. Consider it me doing a good deed."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Decker narrowed his eyes, sizing up Kiki's alluring figure, and smiled triumphantly, thinking, "Such a beautiful and sexy woman will soon be my plaything."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Payne, tell me, I'll do whatever you say."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kiki nodded repeatedly, afraid Decker would change his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing that Kiki had fallen into the trap, Decker was quite satisfied, thinking, "Since she's already trapped, there's no need to keep acting. Let me reap the fruits."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Morrison, I'm old and haven't been with a woman for a long time. Since you're so desperate, why don't you serve me well, and I'll forgive you and not pursue your matter."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Decker revealed a lascivious smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What? Mr. Payne, you...you could be my grandfather. I... can't. I can't do this! No."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kiki was so scared that she took several steps back. Her face turned red, and she couldn't bear to look into Decker's lustful eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She trembled all over and quickly wrapped her arms around her body as if trying to shield her trembling mounds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Morrison, did you forget what you just said?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Decker glared at Kiki with a stern expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Since you're lying to me, I won't be merciful. Such a simple request, and you can't satisfy me, so how can you say you'll do anything?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't want to force you. Pack your things and go home. I'll fire you according to the school rules."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I have the video as evidence. what do you have to say?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Decker threatened Kiki while picking up his phone, ready to make a call.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll call the HR staff now and give them the USB drive to avoid them thinking I'm firing employees without reason. Your behavior seriously violates the school rules and has caused a bad influence, so your salary for this period will also be deducted as a fine."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This series of threats was like a barrage of bombs, leaving Kiki overwhelmed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kiki was struck like lightning, and her resistance instantly crumbled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought, "If I'm publicly fired, and the video on the USB drive spreads in the industry sooner or later,</span><span> </span><span>I'll become a disgrace and a laughingstock in the teaching profession, and I might even be stripped of my teaching qualifications by the education bureau."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"By then, I won't just lose my job at the school. I won't even be able to work as a tutor. All those years </span><span>I spent </span><span>at the normal university will have been wasted."</span></p><div class="pagination">
