  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this very moment, on a mysterious island, Guzman's left hand caressed a black doll, while his right hand flipped through Alexander's files, anxiety flickering in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His cousin, Sebastian, had been in </span><span>Loscity</span><span> for quite some time now. Initially, they had stayed in frequent contact, but now there was no word from him at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Guzman thought, "And dark sorcerer Drake is also unreachable. Could they both have fallen at Alexander's hands?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No way!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian, that useless fool, might be dead, but killing a Dark Mage? I don't believe Alexander could manage that."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He slammed the documents forcefully onto the coffee table, his gaze piercing through the floor-to-ceiling windows to the sea beyond.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only on Treasure Island could Guzman find a fleeting moment of peace, for this was his personal domain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Spending a staggering 10 billion dollars to acquire this island from </span><span>Mesco</span><span> was the wisest investment of his life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Guzman had lavishly built a circular road around the island, and the central commercial district spanned hundreds of thousands of square feet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The island was home to over ten thousand members and families of the Brilliant Group, heavily guarded, with even anti-ship and anti-aircraft missiles worth a fortune.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one could set foot on this island without his permission, not even the government.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the office, captivating moans echoed for well over an hour before finally subsiding with a climactic cry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Betty, satiated like a well-fed kitten, nestled contentedly in Alexander's arms, her fingers tracing patterns on his chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You big beast, are you a donkey? You always leave me so thoroughly used up," she purred.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smirked. "Isn't it you who always tempts me? You were so loud just now; Augusta and the others must have heard you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Betty blushed furiously but snorted. "I don't care if they did. They dare not tell Ava about it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's expression suddenly grew awkward as he was unsure how to respond.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing his discomfort, Betty quickly reassured him, "Don't worry, you're my boss. I won't go blabbing."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's mood was complex as he asked, "With your stunning looks and sexy figure, sneaking around with me like this? Doesn't that feel unfair?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Betty rolled her eyes, "You're such an old-fashioned prude!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Annoyed by her words, Alexander grabbed her plump, bountiful boobs and began to knead them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Betty let out another soft moan, feeling Alexander's formidable arousal ignite again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Please... Boss, I was wrong! Just let me off today; I can't take any more..." Betty pleaded, her beautiful eyes sparkling with seduction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Betty, you started it. Now you're aware of what happens, huh?" Alexander teased, continuing to play with her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her boobs were so voluptuous that he couldn't grasp them entirely with one hand. When he squeezed hard, his fingers sank deep into her soft, creamy flesh. Betty was indeed a rare gem.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Boss, be gentle; this is flesh, after all..." she whimpered, but there was no resistance in her voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a serious expression, Alexander warned, "Next time, it can't be like this. If you </span><span>dare tempt me again, I'll make sure your backside is sore."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfazed, Betty pushed her chest up playfully towards him. "Oh, so you enjoy that kind of play, Boss?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I didn't know you were so adventurous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Look, you even left a mark&mdash;just kiss it better and it won't hurt anymore."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was at a loss. Having such a subordinate was both amusing and exasperating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The memory of Betty's enticing cries from just moments before lingered in his mind, filling him with a sense of dominance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After releasing some tension, he felt relaxed, even invigorated, as if everything was suddenly more vivid and the world around him had sharpened into clarity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wait!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's surprise turned to delight as he realized that a trace of the Force left by James was subtly integrating into his body a little at a time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though it was just a tiny amount&mdash;about the size of a hair strand&mdash;each tiny increase in the Force he could control meant a boost to his power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He mused, "Could it be because of being with </span><span>Lara</span><span> and Betty?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The connection between a man and a woman can really lead to an exchange of energies, even drawing on the Force..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander recalled the Ultimate Legacy that warned that some Warriors walked the path of debauchery due to such connections, ultimately falling into the ranks of the Corrupted Warriors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the realization sank in, a wave of complex emotions washed over him.</span></p><div class="pagination">
