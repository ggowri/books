  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix had deep connections in the military. While he couldn't get his hands on advanced combat armor, they'd spent big money acquiring several basic exoskeletons.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Peter sneered at Rosalia, "Listen here, sweetheart. Surrender now, or I'll beat you to a pulp!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Like magic, two samurai swords, katanas, appeared in Rosalia's hands, one long, one short. Their razor-sharp blades gleamed in the light. "You're doomed!" she snarled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Peter showed no fear. Instead, he waved his hand dismissively. "Surround them. I want both women taken alive!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Over thirty members of the Red Umbrella Group encircled Alexander's trio, weapons trained on them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Including Peter, four fighters were wearing basic combat exoskeletons. They exchanged knowing glances, their eyes burning with lust as they openly ogled Rosalia and Charlize's curves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Peter threatened them with a smug grin, "Ladies, if you want to live, don't move a muscle. Play nice with us and we might let you live. But this guy? He's </span><span>gotta</span><span> go."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His men fired at Alexander's feet, kicking up dirt everywhere. What a blatant taunt!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander watched them with cold detachment, his icy gaze sizing them up like they were already dead. He didn't rush to act.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To him, these people were like trash on the ground, not even worth the effort of dealing with them himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sir, can we take action now?" Charlize asked menacingly, fed up with their opponents' arrogance and disrespect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Rosalia, kill Peter first, along with those guys in combat exoskeletons. They're all yours. You have three minutes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you go over three minutes, or if even one survives, you'll face punishment."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander issued the command with a smile, curious to see how much Rosalia's combat abilities had improved after the magic circle enhancement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No worries, Sir. I won't need three minutes. Two will do," Rosalia replied without hesitation, licking her lips as her killer instinct surfaced.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Taking down Peter and those warriors in combat exoskeletons would be quite a challenge, especially with dozens of their subordinates present. The pressure was undeniable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Rosalia was already an exceptional assassin who thrived on challenges, and she was eager to prove herself to Alexander. Her blood was pumping with excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Peter sneered at Alexander's words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you think you can kill us? Do you have any idea how strong I am?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm a metahuman with strength power and with this combat exoskeleton, my fighting ability matches a level-two metahuman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Plus, my brothers here are just as strong. Sending this pretty little thing to kill us? That's the funniest joke I've ever heard..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Peter and his crew burst into laughter as if they'd just listened to the world's greatest joke.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In one swift motion, Rosalia crossed her dual katanas, creating a fierce blade of light that slashed violently into the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Like a human cannonball, Rosalia rocketed toward Peter's group with explosive force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With only about fifty feet between them, she landed right in the middle of the crowd in a split second.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Except for Alexander, who could track her movements, everyone else just caught a blur before Rosalia vanished from sight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill them!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A fierce battle cry rang out, cold as arctic ice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosalia's blade work was blindingly fast, her long and short katanas becoming deadly wheels of steel that unleashed a storm of blood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Screams pierced the air as several heads flew skyward, their bodies crumpling to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>More agonized cries followed as multiple gunmen were sliced clean in half, weapons and all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They stood frozen in terror, their faces locked in horror as a line of blood traced from their scalps straight down to their hips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Only after Rosalia moved on to her following targets did these bisected bodies finally collapse in a shower of gore, their blood painting the ground crimson.</span></p><div class="pagination">
