  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A man in his forties sat on the sofa, wearing a suit and a black eyepatch over his left eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He lounged back with his legs crossed, casually puffing on a large cigar, sending clouds of smoke into the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Alexander approached, Lanny, who stood beside the one-eyed man, jumped up and pointed at Alexander accusingly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You bastard, you actually dared to show up? Mr. Nicholson, this is the guy who</span><span> helped</span><span> Emma</span><span>! </span><span>He took Emma and Maxine away</span><span>!</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jordan's eye narrowed to a slit, emanating a cold, murderous gleam as he sized Alexander up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lanny, his face still bruised and swollen from the beating Alexander had given him earlier that day, glared at him with cold fury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, a desperate cry rang out. "Get out of here! They lured you here on purpose. They won't let me go..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A slightly balding man was being held by two thugs, his hands bound in handcuffs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander knew this had to be Maxine's father, Alvin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Jordan, I'm giving you a chance. Let him go," Alexander spoke calmly, interlacing his fingers and cracking his knuckles with a series of sharp pops.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jordan sneered and made a gesture. Immediately, one of the thugs beside Alvin drew a sharp dagger and pressed it against Alvin's throat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Watch yourself, man. One wrong move, and he's dead." Jordan's face showed complete confidence in his position.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you're so eager to die, I'll grant your wish."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was </span><span>absolutely certain</span><span> he could take them all down before they could harm Alvin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jordan yanked Alvin's hair and growled, "He can't save you. Hand over all the technical documents if you know what's good for you. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Otherwise, it won't just be you who will die. Your wife and daughter will go to hell with you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His face was twisted with murderous intent as if he would tear Alvin apart with his bare hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite his pained expression, Alvin remained silent, his jaw clenched tight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jordan pointed arrogantly at Alexander. "Get on your knees! I want Alvin to see what happens to people who dare </span><span>challenge</span><span> me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Jordan, please, let me go! Please don't kill anyone... </span><span>N</span><span>othing good will come from this..." Alvin screamed hysterically, struggling with all his might.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hold him down!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After barking the order, Jordan advanced toward Alexander, flanked by two hulking enforcers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Contemptuous smiles spread across their faces as they sized up Alexander like he was easy prey.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill him, Mr. Nicholson!" Lanny shouted excitedly. "Make sure he's dead!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At Jordan's command, two thugs lunged at Alexander like wolves on the hunt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Back off!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander let out a cold snort and struck their throats with lightning speed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With two sharp cracks, the thugs collapsed to the ground, eyes rolling back in their heads. They lay there like lifeless snakes, boneless and still.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jordan flinched in shock and frantically waved his hand. "Everyone! Get out here, now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chaos erupted in the bar, followed by shouts and the thundering of approaching footsteps.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get out! Everyone </span><span>clear</span><span> out, now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who are these guys? We're leaving. Please don't hit us. Don't hit us!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chaos erupted in the bar within seconds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dozens of men in matching uniforms, each brandishing a gleaming machete, surrounded Alexander with an intimidating presence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were over forty of them, their faces fierce and brimming with menace, ready to gang up on Alexander at any moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander ignored them completely, moving like a phantom to Alvin's side in a flash. His cold gaze fell on the two thugs holding Alvin down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jordan and the others jumped in shock. Alexander's speed was beyond anything they could follow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let him go if you want to live." Alexander's voice cut through the air like ice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two thugs felt a wave of murderous intent wash over them, crushing them down like a mountain. They trembled as they backed away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Go to hell</span><span>!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One of the thugs suddenly roared, driving his gleaming dagger straight at Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a cry of agony, the man's wrist snapped in Alexander's grip, and the dagger fell into Alexander's waiting hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The blade whistled through the air as Alexander slashed the throats of the surrounding thugs in one fluid motion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Crimson blood gushed like fountains as multiple bodies crumpled to the ground, their limbs twitching uncontrollably.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jordan and his </span><span>thugs</span><span> stumbled backward in terror.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lanny broke into a cold sweat, his eyes wild with fear as he stared at Alexander. "You... you actually dared to kill</span><span> people</span><span>?"</span></p><div class="pagination">
