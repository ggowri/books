  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it, who dares to go against me? They're asking for it!" Leonard Moon snapped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He waved his hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Whoosh!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A few tarot cards spun through the air like blades, embedding themselves deeply into the wall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The tense auction had come to an end, and the mysterious bracelet now belonged to Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nate's face was pale, staring blankly at Alexander, his eyes filled with both anger and disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander had actually spent ten million dollars to buy that so-called ancient bracelet. Even though it was a piece of history, it was definitely not worth that much.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Such a massive move had completely stunned Nate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nate wasn't stupid&mdash;someone who could make such an expensive purchase without even blinking was definitely not someone he could mess with.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite how unwilling Nate was, he could only swallow his anger. He didn't even dare to look at Alexander anymore. Before the auction was over, he left with his tail between his legs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The extraordinary events of the auction soon spread, giving everyone something to talk about for a long time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for Alexander's background, nobody knew anything. All they knew was that he was a mysterious tycoon&mdash;spending money like water and daring to confront Leonard Moon!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next few auction items were just jewelry and antiques, far less exciting. Alexander didn't make any more bids.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our auction. Thank you all for your support! Thank you so much!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leo Jenkins, the auctioneer, gave a deep bow on stage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The attendees began to leave their seats, and Ava and Alexander made their way backstage to settle the payment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lynn and a few staff members brought over the rare blue sapphire and the mysterious bracelet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom!" Ava called out, hurrying over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hello, Ms. Blackburn!" Alexander stood and greeted her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lynn studied Alexander curiously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At today's auction, he had undoubtedly been the center of attention.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His calm confidence as he threw down tens of millions to buy the bracelet had genuinely surprised her. She couldn't help but wonder who he really was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>During the auction, Lynn had been watching from the control room, her eyes constantly on Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She'd seen plenty of influential figures in her life, but Alexander's unique charisma </span><span>and confidence made even those figures pale in comparison.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alex, here are your items."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lynn smiled warmly, gesturing, and a staff member promptly handed over a specially crafted case.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you, Ms. Blackburn."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander opened the case, inspected the items, and then handed over the payment without hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, in the lobby of the auction hall, Timothy and Arthur stood waiting, heads bowed, anxiously hoping for Alexander to come out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Timothy's heart ached at the thought&mdash;he had spent over a million dollars on jewelry, which now had to be handed over to Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the memory of that unbearable pain, which not even anesthetics could ease, kept him from defying Alexander's wishes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment Timothy saw Alexander, he forced a wide smile and respectfully held out the jewelry with both hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Boss, here's the necklace and the bangles I won at the auction&mdash;just a small gesture, I hope you won't mind."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander chuckled, taking the jewelry and handing it over to Ava.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you like them? They're yours."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava was both surprised and delighted as she admired the masterfully crafted diamond necklace and bangles, her heart filling with warmth and sweet happiness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander gave her a quick kiss on the cheek, whispering in her ear, "I'm going to pay Victor Hughe a visit. You take care of your mom... I'll be back soon. Wait for the good news."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava's expression turned serious, and she nodded firmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's go!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander got into Timothy's car, and they sped away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava watched until the car disappeared in the distance before turning back to find her mom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, not far from a corner, a shadow slipped away&mdash;it was Leonard Moon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes narrowed, and a dangerous gleam appeared in his gaze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the car, Timothy suddenly let out a pained groan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Boss, something feels wrong. My head&mdash;it hurts! Ugh! Ugh... what's happening to me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It hurts! It hurts so bad! Please, help me..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both Arthur and Timothy began to scream, their voices growing louder and more desperate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The driver was trembling in fear, but Alexander seemed unfazed.</span></p><div class="pagination">
