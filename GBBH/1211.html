  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He straight-up insulted us metahumans!" Gael jabbed a finger at Alexander, practically spitting the words at the woman. "Said we think we're better than everyone else, that we're worse than regular people!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This woman was clearly Gael's backup, and she was here to make Alexander eat his words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The tension in the room went through the roof as both sides sized each other up. Nobody dared to break the silence until Quentin finally stepped in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ilona, what's this about?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ilona Cox kept her cool, meeting his gaze without flinching. "General Thompson, I'm just here to set things right for Gael. He's one of my people, and as his leader, I can't let this slide."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quentin's face turned an interesting shade of purple. "Listen, Ilona, having a general for a dad doesn't give you a free pass to do whatever you want! The squad team answers to me now, and I'm ordering you to take your people and leave."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ilona's face darkened. "General Thompson, I respect you, and I'm not trying to start beef. But we've got our own code in the military, and I've got to help Gael save face here. That's just how it is."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Save face? You think I'm trying to stop you? I'm worried you're </span><span>gonna</span><span> get your ass handed to you! Fuck!" Quentin was fuming, dropping an f-bomb before he could stop himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Whatever, let's see what they want. I'll handle this myself." Alexander brushed past Quentin and headed straight for Ilona.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ilona gave Alexander a once-over before speaking calmly, "Ilona Cox, a colonel, and a level-four metahuman. Beat me at the range, and we'll forget about this whole thing with Gael."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ilona looked like someone who'd been spoiled rotten at home and had the skills to back up her attitude, probably thinking she was something special.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Level-four firearm power... Colonel... Now, this is getting interesting," Alexander said with a slight smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ilona gave Quentin a nod. "General Thompson, since Alexander has agreed to a friendly match, I hope you'll allow it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quentin stayed quiet. Ilona had always been a pain in the neck, using her family connections and exceptional skills as an excuse to ignore the chain of command.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maybe letting Alexander take her down a peg would teach her she wasn't the hotshot she thought she was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ilona walked straight up to Alexander, fixing him with an unwavering stare.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her big doe eyes might have looked innocent&mdash;bright and clear&mdash;but they held all the warmth of an ice cube.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you sure you want to do this? You're going to lose." Alexander's expression remained completely unbothered like she wasn't even worth his concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmph!" Ilona's eyes turned even colder. This guy was exactly as arrogant as Gael had said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, you've gone too far! Boss, you've got to get revenge for us. He slapped me across the face!" Gael wouldn't shut up about it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shut your mouth! If you're not embarrassed by your whining, I sure am."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ilona's sudden bark made Gael stumble back several steps.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander couldn't help but burst out laughing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This only made Ilona's expression darker. Alexander's laughter was clearly mocking them, showing he didn't take them seriously at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, since I'm Gael's boss, I've got to settle this score with you! How about it? Loser gets down on </span><span>his</span><span> </span><span>knees and apologizes?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Ilona spoke, she pointed to the nearby shooting station, obviously challenging Alexander to a shooting match.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Have you no shame? Just because you have firearm power, you want to challenge Alexander to a shooting match? Why not something else? You're clearly trying to take advantage here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brittany snapped back at Ilona. After all, the woman was a Level 4 metahuman. Brittany worried Alexander might accept in the heat of the moment. They couldn't let him compete against Ilona's strongest skill.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ilona ignored Brittany completely, instead fixing her mocking gaze on Alexander. "Heh, Alexander, are you scared? Having a woman fight your battles for you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quentin tried to step in too&mdash;he didn't want to see Alexander lose. Level-four firearm power was no joke. Ilona could amplify modern weapons' power by ten to even dozens of times their normal capability.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Alexander held Quentin back. He neither accepted nor declined the shooting challenge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, now you're scared, Alexander? What happened to that big attitude from earlier?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, you better watch out. Ilona's </span><span>gonna</span><span> put you in your place!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gael and his buddies kept taunting Alexander with their smug grins.</span><span> </span></p><div class="pagination">
