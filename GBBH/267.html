  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nick was so excited that his voice trembled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, we'll sign then! I never imagined I could own a mansion at Ballad. I knew I was destined to be successful!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mia beamed with excitement. "Honey, you did it! We've struck it rich."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nick carefully reviewed the documents, feeling elated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh my God! This mansion costs over 40 million!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Over 40 million? That's a lot! We must put our names on it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mia's eyes were filled with greed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Betty was about to stop them, but Alexander held her back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nick didn't hesitate any longer, grabbing the pen and quickly writing his and Mia's names.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mia's eyes sparkled with excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Our names are on it now. Once the papers are done, this mansion is ours, and no one can take it away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, don't forget that you owe us $20,000 every month. It's the least you can do. You caused Nick to lose his job, and we haven't even held you accountable. You should be grateful!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily, who was standing nearby, felt deeply embarrassed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Alexander hadn't held her hand tightly, she would have lost her temper by now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If these weren't her own son and his wife, she wouldn't want to be around such greedy people.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It turned out that all their recent kindness was just a scheme to use her to seize Alexander's assets.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's face was full of mockery and ridicule. Nick and Mia's greed had blinded them, making their cunning backfire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was a mansion worth over 40 million.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The annual property tax alone would be over a million dollars, not to mention other maintenance costs, totaling about two million dollars a year.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Could Nick and Mia, a pair of paupers, afford that?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, the house is yours now?" Alexander asked playfully, looking at Nick.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nick had finished filling out the forms as fast as he could and said proudly, "You didn't object earlier, and now my </span><span>name's</span><span> on it. Are you really going to back out in front of my mom?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mia quickly added, "Alexander, you can't go back on your word, or how will you ever make it up to us?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander nodded. "Alright, I've met shameless people before, but you two are the most shameless I've ever seen."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nick ignored Alexander and stood up, arrogantly raising both arms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh God! I own a 40-million-dollar mansion now. I'm finally a rich man!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mia looked around, greedily admiring the luxurious decor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She couldn't resist touching the opulent furnishings, each of them worth a fortune.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Honey, am I dreaming?" she asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nick shot her a look.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mia, don't be so petty. It's not even a 50-million-dollar house. Someday, I'll live in a mansion worth hundreds of millions. That's a true luxury!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nick pounded his chest confidently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Betty and the bodyguards had kept quiet the entire time, holding back their anger and itching to tear these two apart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without Alexander's orders, they didn't dare make a move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander motioned for Betty. When she came closer, he whispered something to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Betty was stunned at first, then couldn't help but chuckle. She hadn't expected her boss to be so cunning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She then took out her phone, sent a message, and nodded at Alexander. Both of them wore mischievous smiles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, a middle-aged man in a neatly pressed suit arrived with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He gave Alexander a slight bow, saying, "Mr. Hawthorne, welcome as our esteemed homeowner. I'm Charles Evans from the Homeowners' Association."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey! Are you mistaken?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nick interrupted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Charles, who said Alexander is the owner here? I am the owner of this mansion. If you have any issues, speak with me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Charles was taken aback and looked at Alexander in confusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smiled and nodded. "Nick's right. The mansion is his now. You can handle everything with him from here on."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nick snorted proudly, seeing how compliant Alexander was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, do you believe it? You can deal with me. No one else has the authority here because I am the owner."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Charles seemed to understand, assuming Alexander had bought the mansion for Nick.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He quickly apologized to Nick, "Mr. Portman, my apologies. I should've clarified </span><span>earlier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm here to collect the maintenance fees for the common areas, totaling $360,650!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
