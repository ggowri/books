  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With just one command from Guzman, no one would listen to Cloe anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ever since Sebastian and Evan disappeared, Guzman had become increasingly irritable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cloe was always the one to take the blame, but she had no choice but to endure it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Guzman gazed at Cloe with a complex look in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Having experienced terrible things in his youth, he could not have children of his own, and thus, his feelings towards his adopted daughter were complicated, yet there were things he had to do.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Everyone, I've called you here late at night to discuss two matters with you! First, the Red Umbrella Group has torn up our cooperation agreement and refuses to continue providing potential potions. What are your thoughts on this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>An older man with white hair stood up and bowed to Guzman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Guzman replied indifferently, "Grandpa, I've told you many times that you don't need to bow to me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the older man still knelt on one knee, his face filled with anger, his bright blue eyes brimming with murderous intent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"After developing the potential potion, the Red Umbrella Group is now focusing on training their elite forces, clearly intending to annex us and fully occupy Treasure Island! They are ambitious and aggressive. We cannot sit idly by. It's best we strike first."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was surprised that even Guzman's grandfather was so fearful of him. In the Brilliant Group, only Guzman had the final say. Perhaps they wouldn't even listen to the Godfather.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Bryant, please give the order. While the Red Umbrella Group hasn't perfected the potential potion yet, let's wipe out their forces on the island!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Others also knelt on one knee, pleading with Guzman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, they respectfully waited for a long time, but Guzman didn't utter a single word.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Whoever his cold gaze fell upon couldn't help but tremble, feeling a deep-seated fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Guzman slammed his hand on the table and said coldly, "If we want to attack the Red Umbrella Group, we must first clean up our internal situation. I think you all know about Sebastian and Evan's disappearance in </span><span>Loscity</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"John from the trading center is also out of contact now. I suspect Alexander has made it to the island. Before dealing with the Red Umbrella Group, we must find him and eliminate him first!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is the second matter I wanted to discuss. Alexander should not be underestimated. We must quickly remove this threat."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instantly, the members of the Bryant family present were shocked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Alexander, hiding in the ceiling, was surprised. Guzman was indeed a formidable figure with strong logical reasoning skills.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Guzman would never guess that he was here, watching everything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Cloe, if I remember correctly, you are in charge of the cruise ship and the entire island's defense, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Guzman turned his cold gaze to Cloe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cloe felt his fierce aura and shuddered. She prostrated herself on the ground, her body drenched in sweat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She knew that since Guzman was questioning her publicly, this would not be an easy ordeal to get through.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Cloe, tell me, why has John gone missing? Has Alexander infiltrated the island? You were so confident in managing the defense work and ensuring no ill-intentioned individuals could slip in, but what now? All the elders are here. Give us an explanation in front of everyone."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Guzman's tone was icy, exuding a sharp, murderous aura.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dad, I... I will definitely find out the truth about John's disappearance... Please give me a little time..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cloe trembled with fear, her face pale.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She knew Guzman was making an issue out of this. She didn't seem to have done anything she shouldn't have. She didn't understand why Guzman was targeting her like this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, a man in black hurriedly arrived, handing a stack of documents to Guzman and whispering something into his ear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What? Alexander has taken over the Fraternity in </span><span>Loscity</span><span> and become the executive elder of the Federer family?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Guzman's face changed dramatically, his expression becoming extremely cold and stern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Good, very good. He is indeed my brother, indeed the blood of that old man. A mere nobody from the bottom of society, yet ten times more formidable than I imagined!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Guzman furrowed his brows deeply. He had underestimated Alexander and his ambitions even more.</span></p><div class="pagination">
