  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kris, tell your father to inventory your family's property. Someone will take it within 24 hours, as well as your entire family's lives, as a warning to others!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's voice was as cold as polar ice, and he intended to eliminate the Lauren family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come on. Kill the lunatic!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kris waved his hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His men immediately swarmed forward, full of murderous intent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the Lauren family's support, they were not afraid of killing people at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Time seemed to stand still. The muscular man who had first rushed upon Alexander swung his machete and struck at him fiercely.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He suddenly found himself motionless, as if his body was trapped in an invisible quagmire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite his struggles and efforts, he couldn't move at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You! What did you do to me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man gazed at Alexander in horror. The pressure on his body increased, causing him to tremble uncontrollably. His bones creaked under the weight, and beads of </span><span>sweat the size of beans streamed down his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can't move. Why is this happening?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He clutched the machete with both hands, only a foot away from Alexander's head, but he couldn't cut it off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because he used so much force, his eyes were bloodshot and nearly popped out of their sockets.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's going on? I can't move, either. Who caused this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Could it be this guy?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Other people had the same experience, feeling as if the air had turned into a quagmire or as if they were carrying a mountain on their backs. They were completely unable to move and were all terrified.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were all the elite of the Lauren family. Conceited, they thought highly of their fighting skills.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the dozens of people became powerless before getting close to Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You! Are you a fucking devil?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kris tried hard to raise the gun in his hand with a ferocious expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But, despite his many attempts, he couldn't do it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon entering, Kris felt superior and looked down upon others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, unprecedented fear overwhelmed him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Since you are seeking death, I will send you to hell as you wish."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander spoke of the murder as calmly as if he was chatting with an old friend.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, several soft white lights flashed across each other, and something horrible happened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The muscular man in black standing in front of Alexander, along with the machete in his hand, all broke into pieces and collapsed to the floor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kris narrowed his eyes as a chill ran down his spine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was just a simple beginning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The second muscular man also fell down to pieces, his limbs twitching and bleeding all over the floor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One by one, the elite of the Lauren family were smashed to pieces, all lying in pools of blood, their bodies like cut cakes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blood flowed across the floor, carving out strange flowers, and the pungent smell filled the entire restaurant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kris flopped down on the floor, his face as pale as paper.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A-Am I not dead? Am I not dead?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was surprised and overjoyed. Yet, his whole body went limp, and he couldn't even stand up in fright.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hoson</span><span> was extremely shocked by the scene.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't expect Alexander's fighting skills to be so terrifying!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander killed dozens of people without warning and cut them to pieces effortlessly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was incredibly formidable, his strength unfathomable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kris trembled and stuttered, "H-How dare you kill the elite of the Lauren family?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander cast an icy glance at Kris without even frowning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Remember what I just said. Go back and tell your father, Johnathan, to prepare your property. Someone will come to take your lives."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get away!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander waved his hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kris felt a tremendous force strike his chest and, with a wail, flew out of the restaurant.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ouch!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kris thought that at least several of his ribs were broken, for the pain was excruciating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fearing death, he desperately crawled out of the hotel, leaving a long trail of blood behind him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The onlookers were all scared silly, gazing at him blankly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just now, he had rushed in with a large group of people, but now, he was the only one thrown out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was obvious that his men had been murdered!</span></p><div class="pagination">
