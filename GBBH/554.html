I'll have someone hold him back."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Orlando got up from the floor tremblingly, but before he could stand firmly, Clay kicked him down again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, even if you beg me now, I will still smash your bones piece by piece, making you a cripple and letting you live in pain for the rest of your life!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clay launched an attack angrily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He tried to punch Alexander's head hard at lightning speed and with great force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was doomed!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone subconsciously closed their eyes, unable to bear to see Alexander being beaten by Clay.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Orlando and Elaina were even more desperate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a long while, there was no expected scream but silence instead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Orlando opened his eyes cautiously. How could it be possible?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone exclaimed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clay's fist was caught by Alexander, less than four inches away from him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I didn't expect you could take it. Go to hell!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clay's face contorted as he exerted force suddenly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The evil dark energy immediately burst out from his fist, as if his hand was covered with a black glove.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Several bodyguards recognized the energy and exclaimed at the same time, "T-This is </span><span>the evil power of witchcraft. Don't touch it. Be careful!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Witchcraft?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was weird and evil, capable of killing without leaving a trace.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Orlando felt a bone-chilling chill rush from the soles of his feet to the top of his head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was dangerous!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unexpectedly, no matter how miraculous Clay's performance was, Alexander's clean hand still tightly clasped his right hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let go of me! Let go!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clay's face darkened, and he struggled violently. Evil energy gushed out, but it was dissolved into nothingness by the Force, useless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander maintained a gentle smile throughout, and it was evident that he was not yet at full strength.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In Clay's eyes, his smile was simply a mockery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clay took out the dragon head stick with his left hand and plunged it hard into Alexander's throat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Black energy swirled around the dragon head stick, producing a series of afterimages that seemed to have the power to absorb people's souls. Orlando and the others felt dizzy and fell heavily to the floor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Alexander, not affected by the witchcraft at all, grabbed the stick.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No matter how the black energy on the stick surged, it could not escape from his palm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander chuckled, and the Force suddenly burst out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The dragon head stick broke into two pieces with a crack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clay screamed and coughed up a large mouthful of blood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was horrified to death, and even the magic weapon he had carefully crafted was destroyed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Apart from the great elder, there was actually someone else in this world who could force him to this point.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His right hand was still held by Alexander, as if a terrifying iron hoop were tightening rapidly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The bones in Clay's palm were broken. It was excruciatingly painful, and there was only one thought in his mind.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He must get out of here as soon and fast as possible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Go to hell!" Clay roared angrily, shooting the half-broken dragon head stick at Alexander, which exploded with a bang.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A black air enveloped Alexander, and finally, his grip loosened a little.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amid everyone's astonished gaze, Clay turned and fled away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you want to run away?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander had rushed out of the black air and appeared behind Clay in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clay screamed in horror.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander grabbed him by the neck and lifted him into the air effortlessly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Due to the acute lack of oxygen, Clay flapped his legs vigorously and tried to pry Alexander's hands apart with both hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was dead silence, with everyone staring at the scene in a daze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clay, who had been so arrogant just now, became like a powerless chicken in Alexander's hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elaina gazed at Alexander with her beautiful eyes. Her pretty face flushed, and her rapidly heaving breasts revealed her inner excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She covered her chest, feeling numb and itchy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Recalling that her breasts had been touched all over by Alexander, she couldn't help shaking all over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's invincible momentum deeply impressed everyone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clay's face turned from pale to blue and then to purple, and his eyeballs were almost squeezed out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He struggled to pry Alexander's hands apart with both hands, begging intermittently for mercy, "Release me. I was wrong. I was wrong... I apologize to you! I admit defeat. I lost..."</span></p><div class="pagination">
