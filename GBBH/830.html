  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone thought Alexander brought this upon himself. When Bobby's people arrived, he was bound to suffer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Craig quickly stepped in to mediate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Come on, Bobby. We're all classmates. Let's not make this a big deal. I'll talk to Alexander and have him apologize. How about that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Bobby shoved Craig aside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Fatso, do you think I don't know how close you are with Alexander? Get out of my face, or I'll knock you out for a dollar!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Craig hurriedly turned to Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You'd better just apologize to Bobby. Avoid the trouble. We're all classmates, after all."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The other classmates, however, fueled the chaos.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I think Alexander's lost it. He doesn't know when to back down. Mr. Murray was about to offer him a job, and now he goes and hits him?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Exactly! Who does he think he is? Someone needs to teach him a lesson."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Alexander has to pay for this, so he learns his place."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The scene turned into an uproar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Alexander stayed calm, sitting there as if nothing had happened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alice, knowing Alexander well, saw the look on his face and immediately realized Bobby was in big trouble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Bobby, seeing Alexander stay quiet, assumed he was scared and laughed smugly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The door suddenly slammed open with a loud crash on the wall, startling Bobby.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>More than ten burly men stormed in, their menacing presence filling the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Leading them was a man in his fifties, dressed in a black suit and tie, a cigarette dangling from his lips as he casually blew out a puff of smoke.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Holy crap! That's Shawn Bailey from the Iron Cobras!" someone exclaimed. "I can't believe Bobby knows him. Alexander's doomed now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Yeah, the Iron Cobras are one of the top gangs in Loscity. Alexander's lucky if he only loses a hand today."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"He should kneel and apologize now if he knows what's good for him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone was whispering, astonished that Bobby had connections with Shawn Bailey.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing their fearful expressions, Bobby became even more smug, though it pulled on his swollen cheek, making him wince.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ahh..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He groaned, covering his face. Alexander's slap had really done a number on him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He felt grateful for knowing Shawn, as it was Shawn's assistance that had enabled him to make a fortune.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Shawn barked, "Bobby, who the hell dared to hit you? Tell me, and I'll make sure they pay."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Bobby pointed viciously at Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"It's him! Shawn, break his hand for me, and I'll give you one hundred thousand dollars."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Shawn turned to look at Alexander, his eyes narrowing. Then his gaze shifted to Alice, and his expression froze in disbelief, eyes widened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander stood up, his calm demeanor unshaken, and walked over to Shawn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Iron Cobras, Shawn, you should know who I am, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander smiled faintly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before Shawn could respond, Bobby interrupted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Know you? Alexander, who the hell do you think you are? Why would Shawn know you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He jabbed a finger into Alexander's chest. "Scared now, aren't you? Kneel and apologize!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Shawn suddenly shouted, "You're the one who deserves to die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Bobby grinned smugly. "Hear that, Alexander? Shawn said you deserve to die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>To everyone's shock, Shawn swung his fist and punched Bobby square in the face, sending him flying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ahhh!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The room fell silent. Everyone was stunned, wondering what was going on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They didn't understand Shawn was supposed to be Bobby's backup. Why had he just hit him?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As the crowd looked on in shock, Alexander raised his hand and slapped Shawn. Hard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Shawn didn't move. He didn't even flinch. He stood tall, letting Alexander hit him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander slapped him again, this time on the other cheek, leaving Shawn's cheeks swollen on both sides.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But the head of the Iron Cobras still stood tall and proud, his face not showing anger but rather a mix of fear and ingratiation.</span></p><div class="pagination">
