  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smiled, "Why? Mr. Gomez, are you reluctant? Is your daughter's life not worth a piece of bone fragment?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Orlando froze and then burst into laughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sure! If you can really cure my daughter, I will give you whatever you want, not to mention a piece of dragon bone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Besides, you are so young. You can also become friends with my daughter and cultivate feelings. If you can get married, our family property worth more than ten billion dollars will be yours."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was suddenly a dead silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone swallowed hard, their hearts racing and their eyes wide open, and they started imagining.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elaina was a top-notch beauty and the heiress to a </span><span>fortune worth tens of billions of dollars</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Countless men regarded her as their dream girl, and she had numerous suitors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately, she was demanding and never picked any of them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While everyone was shocked, Alexander smiled calmly, "I only want the dragon bone fragment, nothing else. Thank you, Mr. Gomez."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What!?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone couldn't believe it and wondered if they had misheard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was too arrogant. He actually refused Elaina and her tens of billions of dollars in wealth. Was he a lunatic?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Orlando snorted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His face blushed with anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He sneered, "Okay, I'll give you a chance. If you disappoint me, I will definitely kill you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander remained composed and followed him in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The onlookers began to chat again behind his back, making various comments. However, no one was optimistic about Alexander and thought he was seeking death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, many medical staff gathered in a bedroom of the mansion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They all surrounded the bed, gazing at Elaina with worried faces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was just in her early twenties. Her pretty face was bloodless, and her eyes were closed. Her facial features were very stunning, and her skin was very smooth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Gomez family spent more than ten million dollars to build this top-level intensive care unit but still failed to wake Elaina up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A few days ago, she was awake occasionally, but after some medical treatment, her condition worsened, and she fell into a coma.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So</span><span> Orlando became extremely anxious and gave those quacks a good beating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elaina..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Orlando tiptoed to the bedside and fixed his eyes on Elaina with a pained expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although he had many women, an illness deprived him of fertility, so Elaina was his only child and his spiritual support.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander asked, "How is she?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>An elderly doctor glanced at him curiously and explained slowly, "Ms. Elaina Gomez is severely ill. Her vital signs have declined, and she has also lost her response to external stimuli. She might remain a vegetable for the rest of her life."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Orlando immediately roared, "Losers! If my daughter becomes a vegetable, I swear I will bury you all alive!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"W-We really tried our best. Don't bury us alive..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those doctors trembled with fear, and their clothes were soaked with cold sweat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How incompetent! Get out of here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After driving them away, Orlando turned and looked at Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You'd better not let me down, or you'll be in trouble!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander didn't care about his threat at all. Instead, he used his Force Sense and opened his All-seeing Eyes to observe the situation inside Elaina's body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Minute after minute passed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Five minutes later, Alexander was still staring at Elaina without saying a word.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her condition was indeed very critical now. She was not sick, but had been bewitched.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander could feel within her an evil energy that had completely corrupted her body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The culprit didn't seem to want to take Elaina's life right away. Otherwise, she would have died long ago.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But even so, if Alexander came a few days later, no one could save her then.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The room was quiet. Everyone stared at him with wide eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Orlando gazed at him intently and asked nervously, "How is my daughter?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was about to explain Elaina's condition.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Gomez, Ms. Elaina Gomez will be rescued! Ms. Elaina Gomez will be rescued!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, an elderly man who looked like a butler rushed in from outside, panting, and whispered softly in Orlando's ear.</span></p><div class="pagination">
