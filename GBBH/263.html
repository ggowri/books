  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander felt the Force left by James. He absorbed and mastered a lot of it. His breathing became lighter and quieter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nourished by the Force, every cell in his body continued to grow stronger and evolve, and his muscles and bones became stronger and tougher.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was surprised. He had made great progress in strength just by being intimate with the beauties. It was simply incredible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Over time, he would one day be promoted to a higher-level Warrior. By then, it was unknown how terrifying Alexander would be.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly Alexander's expression changed and he looked towards the cabin door vigilantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was someone outside!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He immediately jumped up and walked towards the door quietly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alice was so exhausted that she was sleeping soundly and didn't notice anything unusual.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander opened the door and saw a tall man in a black cloak standing not far away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was completely hidden in the darkness. If it weren't Alexander, one would not have been able to be discovered at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander stared at him and used the Force to sense the slightest movement within a hundred meters.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the guy in front of him had extremely weak breathing and heartbeat, even harder to detect than a fly in the corner.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This guy was not an ordinary person. He was the strongest person Alexander had ever met, and may even be as strong as him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay, Alexander is indeed extraordinary. You can find me in the first place."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man said slowly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you working for my father?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was skeptical.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man nodded. His hoarse voice filled with coldness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I am the Godfather's bodyguard. Mr. Hawthorne, you can call me Shadow."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shadow? What do you want from me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander looked at him warily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was surprised that Godfather had such a terrifying and powerful person around him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shadow said calmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Congratulations for taking control of the Brilliant Group. The Godfather sent me to ask you for something."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander narrowed his eyes. If Shadow had any conspiracy, he would take action at the first moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shadow said calmly, "The Godfather is not in good health. He needs Ancestral Witch's Cane and uses the life energy to prolong his life."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was silent. He didn't expect that everything would be under the control of </span><span>his father.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne, you wouldn't be unwilling, would you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shadow's tone changed slightly, hinting at displeasure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander thought for a moment and said, "I have never thought of sacrificing innocent people, so Ancestral Witch's Cane is useless to me. I can give it to you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But you have to tell me, what does father think of the death of my eldest brother?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shadow smiled and said in a voice that seemed to see through everything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Godfather knew that you were building your private power, which was a serious violation of principle and should have been punished by death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"However, the Godfather said that if you can obtain the position of heir, everything will be yours, and there will be no violation of anything."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander frowned. He didn't expect that everything he did would be controlled by his father.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shadow stretched out his hand to Alexander. "Give it to me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without any hesitation, Alexander took Ancestral Witch's Cane from the room and gave it to Shadow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The secret of top witchcraft was hidden in Ancestral Witch's Cane, but Alexander was not interested in it at all. He had the Ultimate Legacy and the Force left by James.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't even learn Ultimate Legacy thoroughly, let alone study witchcraft.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And it turned out that his power of the Force was no worse than witchcraft.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Shadow successfully obtained Ancestral Witch's Cane, his tone softened significantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aren't you afraid that after the Godfather has Ancestral Witch's Cane, he will become immortal through sacrifice and occupy the position of Godfather forever?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was stunned for a moment, then said, "I haven't thought about it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shadow was stunned by his answer, and then he laughed. There was some appreciation in his laughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne, I am very optimistic about you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he said this, he took the initiative to extend his hand to Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander knew that Shadow wanted to compete with him, so he shook his hand without fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sure enough, a huge and powerful force crushed over. Alexander exclaimed in surprise and quickly burst out the Force to hold it back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both of them trembled and staggered back several steps.</span></p><div class="pagination">
