  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Police cars and armored vehicles swarmed in and surrounded the hotel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't move. Drop your guns and put your hands on your heads! Otherwise, I will kill you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caleb and his men were encircled, with countless black gun muzzles pointed at them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He explained, "Misunderstanding! This is a misunderstanding. I am not targeting the hotel..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A misunderstanding? You are so bold! Surrender now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was an angry roar. Quentin appeared at the door of the hotel aggressively, followed by Dawson, Alexander, and Madelyn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander watched the show with a broad grin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caleb stared at Quentin in confusion. "Who are you? I did offend you. I'm here for Alexander."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Walter snorted coldly, "This is Mr. Thompson, commander of the Northern Command, a four-star general!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caleb immediately froze as if struck by lightning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His men behind him were also scared silly, with cold sweat on their backs. Wasn't fighting the military tantamount to courting death?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caleb quickly and carefully apologized.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Thompson, I'm sorry. I didn't know you were here. I am just here to seek revenge on Alexander, not to disturb you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quentin glared at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander is the savior of the Thompson family. Are you asking for trouble?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caleb's face turned pale instantly, and he immediately explained, "Mr. Thompson, Alexander bullied my son repeatedly for no reason, so I..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before he could finish his words, Quentin interrupted him angrily, "Shut up!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It was Marcos who bullied others. After being punished by Alexander, he still wanted to do evil. That's the price he should pay.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Put down your gun right now, and I will give you a chance to live!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a livid face, Caleb gritted his teeth and gazed at Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Thompson, I didn't offend you. Are you going too far?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quentin slapped Caleb hard across the face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caleb staggered, covering his burning cheek and not daring to fight back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quentin sneered, "Caleb, I will count to three. If you don't surrender, I will tear you to shreds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"One!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Two!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without further ado, he began to count.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caleb was extremely panicky, and his hand, which held the gun, shook violently.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Quentin was about to count to three, Caleb dropped his gun and surrendered in public.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I was wrong. I am sorry. I will never cause trouble for Alexander again..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His men also threw down their guns and were captured in dismay.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone had a different expression. Caleb was just a gangster boss, not qualified enough to stand up to a four-star general.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quentin smiled at Alexander and said, "You have the final say on how to deal with this matter."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone felt mixed emotions about Quentin's respectful attitude towards Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander replied calmly, "A living enemy will one day take his revenge."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caleb jumped up like crazy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Several soldiers nearby were caught off guard. Caleb rushed to Madelyn, seized her by the neck with his left hand, pulled out a dagger with his right hand, and pressed it against her chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, you damn bastard, I've already admitted my mistake and apologized, but you still want to kill me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let me go now, or I'll kill this bitch!" Caleb roared. The tip of the dagger had pierced slightly into Madelyn's chest, and blood oozed out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She turned pale and trembled uncontrollably with fright.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone was stunned, never expecting Caleb to fight back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander glared at him fiercely and stepped forward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop! Don't come over!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caleb threatened Alexander while retreating into a car nearby with Madelyn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, he drove out of the encirclement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Furious, Quentin was about to order a pursuit but was stopped by Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I will go alone. It's less dangerous."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Will that, Alexander jumped into a car and chased after Caleb.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quentin frowned and watched Alexander's car disappear from his sight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caleb stopped the car awkwardly in an abandoned factory in the suburbs and glared at Madelyn fiercely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He snorted, "You didn't expect you to be caught by me, did you?"</span></p><div class="pagination">
