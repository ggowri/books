  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander sneered and thought there was no way a group of sheep could defeat a lion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Most people would have been unable to dodge when they faced the crazy charge of dozens of people, but Alexander launched a counterattack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Force exploded, and he crashed into the crowd like a speeding main battle tank.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crisp sound of bones breaking and screams came one after another.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as they touched Alexander's body, they were knocked away by the huge force, breaking their bones and tendons.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the blink of an eye, more than 20 people were lying on the ground, groaning and wailing continuously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The rest of the people were already scared out of their wits. No matter how high the bounty was, they had to survive to get it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zachary's face turned pale. He knew he couldn't stop Alexander, so he didn't dare to stop him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, Alexander strode inside, kicked open the doors one by one, and searched for Madelyn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, he arrived at the room at the end of the corridor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was Miranda Hotel's most luxurious private room. With his keen hearing, Alexander could vaguely hear the evil laugh coming from inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He kicked the door with his foot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The heavy wooden door flew up and hit the ground hard, raising a cloud of dust.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Owen and Marcos shuddered with fear, then stared at Alexander with extremely interesting expressions as if they had seen a ghost in daylight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You two beasts deserve to die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's tone was as cold as polar ice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The fierce murderous intent was like an invisible sword, cutting on their faces. Owen and Marcos couldn't help shaking all over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, how dare you come here? Do you know who my dad is? My dad is </span><span>Caleb. Apart from Guzman, my dad is the most powerful one."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcos used his father's power to suppress Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander spat in front of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Isn't your father a drug lord? He's even worse than Guzman, and dare still to act so arrogant in front of me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcos was so angry that his face turned blue, and he didn't know what to say.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, Owen quickly threatened, "Alexander, don't think you are so powerful just because you sneaked in. Miranda Hotel's people will make you pay for it later."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because the private room was well soundproofed, they didn't know that he had already given Miranda Hotel's people a severe lesson.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get lost!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander kicked Owen far away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Madelyn heard his voice, she rushed out of the bathroom in surprise and hugged Alexander tightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those beautiful eyes were filled with tears, gratitude, and joy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're finally here. I thought I'd never see you again..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander couldn't help smiling, "What are you talking about? How is it possible that you can't see me? But don't be so stupid in the future. I will worry."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Really? Are you worried about me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Madelyn was ecstatic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He nodded in astonishment. "Of course, it's true. We are classmates and good friends. Am I worried you is wrong?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Madelyn completely misunderstood what Alexander meant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, in her mind, everything was no longer important. The most important thing was the man in front of her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcos pulled out his gun and pointed it at Alexander. "You bastard! How dare you steal my woman?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was so scared that she quickly stood in front of Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Marcos, do you want to go to jail?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcos had a gun in his hand and was more confident.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He slammed the small medicine bottle on the table and ordered with a sinister smile, "Madelyn, if you don't want Alexander to die, then take this medicine obediently and serve me honestly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Otherwise, I will shoot him right now, and you still can't escape from my grasp."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Madelyn was so angry that she was shaking all over and cursed, "It's despicable and shameless. I won't agree to it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smiled indifferently, pulled her behind him, and then took the initiative to pick up the medicine bottle and take a look.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcos smiled triumphantly, "Alexander, you're so afraid of death. Hurry up and let her take the medicine and kneel down to lick my ass."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Owen got up from the ground with a resentful expression on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Marcos, Alexander is such a wicked fellow. Break his legs first to avoid any more trouble!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just shut up. Do I need you to tell me what to do?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcos pushed Owen away impatiently, then ordered Alexander with a gun.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hurry up and feed the medicine to Madelyn yourself!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander obediently opened the medicine bottle and poured out all the pills inside, which were at least 20 or 30.</span></p><div class="pagination">
