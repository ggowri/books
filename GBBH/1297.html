  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The laboratory housed dozens of high-tech glass pods.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inside one of them, Alexander lay motionless, his body enveloped in a silver liquid.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, the pod trembled violently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A nearby researcher jumped in fright and immediately sounded the alarm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The door slammed open. Yinson strode in, kicked the researcher to the ground, and snapped, "Useless idiot!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Behind him stood over a dozen elderly men, all impeccably dressed and exuding an air of authority. Each one was a figure of immense power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yinson smirked. "Impressive. Alexander broke through the first scenario so quickly. Fine, let's raise the stakes. Initiate the second scenario!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He pressed a red button and barked, "Draw his blood! Gather every data point possible! If we want the Immortality Serum to be perfect, we must uncover the secrets hidden within Alexander."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One of the elders hesitated. "Mr. White, are you sure he won't wake up?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yinson sneered. "Relax. I injected him with ten times the normal dose of the Immortality Serum. The moment he shows signs of waking up, I'll increase the dosage and plunge him into a new illusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As long as he keeps pushing his limits, we'll eventually extract every last secret from him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The elders nodded eagerly. Their eyes gleamed with a predatory hunger like wolves eyeing a defenseless lamb.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anyone home? Delivery for you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Still half-asleep, Alexander opened the door to find an elderly man in his sixties or seventies standing outside. The old man had kind eyes and a warm smile, holding up a package.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander tore it open and found two movie tickets inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A strange musk-like scent wafted up from the package. He glanced down at his right hand and noticed a droplet of golden liquid on the back of it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before he could react, the droplet vanished. He found it odd but didn't dwell on it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What he didn't know was that on the left side of his chest, just over his heart, a faint, palm-sized golden silhouette had begun to form beneath his skin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The shadowy figure seemed to be holding something, pulsing ever so slightly with a dim golden glow in sync with his heartbeat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander cupped his hands around his mouth and shouted, "Logan! Get up! We're going to the movies!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, it's way too early..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A chubby man emerged from the back room. His face was identical to Logan's in Alexander's memories.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They arrived at the theater and followed the crowd into the screening room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The seats were state-of-the-art, resembling astronaut chairs. Each had a circular viewing helmet attached. They settled in and put on their helmets.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The movie began. On the massive screen, bold letters flashed: [Warrior of Triumph over Demons]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A smaller line followed: [Heaven's Rule Film &amp; TV Production.] Then came the credits: [Director: The Best Director. Producer: Top Producer. Starring: Leading Actor Award Winner...]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What the hell is this?" Logan exclaimed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander chuckled. This was going to be interesting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A triumphant, soaring soundtrack filled the theater. A massive blue planet came into view. Two enormous landmasses floated upon an endless ocean, their northern tips barely touching.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To the east lay the Sahasia, shaped like a mighty rooster, ruled by the dominant Hrodvik Dynasty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To the west was Noah Continent, a vast inverted triangle, where the Noah Empire reigned supreme.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Between the two continents lay countless islands, led by the nations of Risun and Xhantao, which together formed the Oceanic Federation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The beat of war drums thundered through the theater.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander and Logan were completely absorbed in the film when suddenly, the screen flickered. The voltage was unstable. Alexander's helmet began flashing on and off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shit! It's going to catch fire!" Alexander yanked at the helmet. Logan rushed to help.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as Alexander pulled the helmet off, a thick plume of smoke poured out. A faint golden glyph shot out from inside and struck Alexander directly in the left side of his chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shit!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Agonizing pain ripped through him. Both he and Logan screamed at the top of their lungs, "Fuck!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everything went black. A crack in space itself split open before them. In the blink of an eye, the void swallowed them whole.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander had no idea how much time had passed. Somewhere in the darkness, he vaguely heard someone calling his name.</span></p><div class="pagination">
