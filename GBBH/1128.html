  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Boss!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Xavier strode towards Alexander excitedly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Boss? Mr. Ulysses, who are you calling? Is the head of the Ultimate Alliance here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Waylon was dumbfounded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew that Xavier, who had just been a nobody in the industry, had risen rapidly to become a big shot after representing the Ultimate Alliance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If I can become a member of the Ultimate Alliance, then..." Waylon murmured to himself, full of expectations.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Alexander walked over, and Waylon roared, "Damn, you are so bold. You hit me yesterday and my sister today. You are doomed!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Ulysses, this guy..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Waylon had a flattering smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, instead of casting a glance at him, Xavier pushed him hard, causing him to stagger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get lost!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Waylon was confused and embarrassed with a livid face, wondering what was going on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Boss, I just got back."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Xavier hugged Alexander passionately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What!?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Waylon was stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a chuckle, Alexander patted Xavier on the back. Among his subordinates, except for the women, Xavier was the only one who dared to embrace him in public.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Waylon stammered, "Mr. Ulysses, i-is he your boss? The boss of the Ultimate Alliance?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Xavier snorted coldly and said contemptuously, "Waylon, haven't you always wanted to </span><span>meet </span><span>our boss? This is our boss, Alexander Hawthorne!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Waylon's mouth was wide open in shock, and he took several steps back in fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Waylon, please - whoever he is, you have to help us get revenge!" His sister clutched his arm desperately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You idiots! Do you have any idea what you've done?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>SLAP! Waylon's hand cracked across his sister's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I keep telling you to keep your head down, but you never listen! Are you trying to destroy me too?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Apologize to Mr. Hawthorne - now! Or I'll kill you myself!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The couple deflated like punctured balloons, suddenly very quiet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander watched the show with an amused smirk like he was enjoying street theater.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Apologize if you want to live!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Waylon kicked his sister hard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm sorry... I'm sorry... I remember now. It was our son who was at fault. He fell and injured himself. I'm sorry..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The couple apologized repeatedly and then ran away in shame with their son.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne, I'm so sorry. </span><span>Yesterday was a mistake</span><span>... I'm</span><span> really </span><span>sorry. I </span><span>don</span><span>'</span><span>t know </span><span>Lynn </span><span>is yours</span><span>. I'm sorry. I was out of my mind!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Waylon apologized to Alexander while slapping himself in the face to beg for mercy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get out of Loscity, and don't harass Lynn again, or I'll castrate you!" Alexander warned, his tone revealing murderous intent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay. I'll leave right away, right away..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Waylon breathed a sigh of relief, turned around, and ran away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander kept his eyes upon him fiercely. Waylon felt a chill down his back and ran faster in fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unexpectedly,</span><span> h</span><span>e tripped and face-planted right into a pile of dog shit. The stench was so bad he nearly puked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander and the others laughed out loud.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But </span><span>Waylon </span><span>didn</span><span>'</span><span>t bother to stay any longer, he got up and rushed out in an instant</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Half an hour later, Alexander and Xavier arrived at Food Street, where more than a dozen shops served breakfast.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Various food was available, such as spaghetti, hamburgers, ravioli, and pizzas, all of which were fragrant with tempting aromas.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander ordered two plates of spaghetti, two hamburgers, and two plates of ravioli. Then, he and Xavier chatted</span><span> </span><span>while eating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Xavier bought several bottles of beer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, drink with me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander asked with a grin, "</span><span>D</span><span>rink in the morning</span><span>?</span><span> Are you upset about something?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Xavier made no reply. He first filled Alexander's glass and then his before gulping it down in one go.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander drank a few glasses with him and asked again, "Xavier, you know I don't like beating around the bush. Tell me what is going on. I will definitely help you if I can."</span></p><div class="pagination">
