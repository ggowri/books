  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Victor stammered, "I... I just wanted to make some money... I didn't mean any harm, really, I swear..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's eyes flashed with anger. "You just wanted to make some money? I think you wanted both her heart and her wealth!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Boss, we found some photos." One of the men approached with a stuffed envelope.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment Victor saw the envelope, his face turned pale.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander took the envelope and looked inside. It was filled with sensual photos of Lynn, including some of them in bed together.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the photos, Lynn looked incredibly provocative, with her full curves on display. Alexander felt a tightening sensation in his pants.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You planned to use these photos to blackmail Lynn, didn't you?" Alexander asked, his expression cold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Victor stammered, "N-no, that's not it... I-I just wanted to keep them as... souvenirs. Lynn is just too damn hot..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rage boiled in Alexander. He kicked Victor hard in the gut.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Victor couldn't even scream, only making strangled noises as a mix of saliva and blood dribbled from his mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander grabbed Victor by the throat, lifting him up. His voice was dangerously calm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you want to live, you'll confess everything."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Alexander's grip tightened, Victor's face turned red, his lungs screaming for air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll... I'll confess... Please, just let me live..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Victor flailed wildly, struggling like a fish tossed onto dry land.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thud!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander released him, letting Victor fall to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Answer my questions honestly, and you won't suffer more. Understand?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Y-yes, I understand," Victor nodded frantically like a chicken pecking at grain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"When were you planning on ditching Lynn?" Alexander asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Victor hesitated before mumbling, "I... I wasn't planning on leaving her. I wanted to marry her. She's gorgeous, has an amazing body, and she's rich..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's fist smashed into Victor's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Victor yelped in pain, crumpling to the ground, holding his face as blood seeped through his fingers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you mess with me again, I'll toss you in the ocean to feed the sharks," Alexander warned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll ask you one more time. When were you planning on ditching Lynn?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A-after I married her, gained her complete trust, and controlled her money... I'd leave her and escape to another country to enjoy life..." Victor stammered, trembling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's cold gaze pierced through him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You said that Lynn was beautiful, had a great body, and was wild. Are you really willing to ditch her?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Victor gulped and said, "After a few years, I'll get bored of her. By then, yeah, I'll be ready to leave."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every word of this exchange was captured by Timothy, who recorded it on his phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, one of the men brought out a notebook they found in the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Victor's diary, detailing all the women he'd deceived over the years, complete with their contact information.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What a scumbag," Alexander muttered, kicking Victor twice more, leaving him lying on the ground, trembling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Timothy, I don't want to see this piece of trash in </span><span>Tijuanea</span><span> again. You understand?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Timothy nodded and ordered his men to tie Victor up, gag him, and throw him into the trunk.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry, boss. I'll feed him to the sharks. He'll vanish without a trace."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander nodded in satisfaction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll transfer twenty million dollars to you. Split one million among the men here, and you and Arthur take the rest. Keep doing good work for me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And if there's any news about SATAN from the Mafia, let me know immediately."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Timothy and Arthur were stunned for a moment, then their faces lit up with joy. They bowed repeatedly, thanking Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smirked. Dealing with people like this required both the carrot and the stick&mdash;a mix of fear and reward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>.....</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Alexander returned to Lynn's house, he found Ava sitting alone on the couch, looking a bit down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's wrong, babe? You look upset."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He pulled her into his arms, giving her a gentle kiss.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava pouted, clearly unhappy, "I told Mom that Victor was a liar, but she wouldn't believe me. We just had a huge fight about it..."</span></p><div class="pagination">
