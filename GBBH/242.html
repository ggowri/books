  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>John was laying a false trail. The three cars were all decoys meant to confuse any potential enemies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was sure that John would appear quietly and stealthily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sure enough, about ten minutes later, a figure in a black robe emerged from the side of the trading hall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although the large black robe covered him from head to toe, Alexander could still be sure that it was John, the general manager of the trading center and Guzman's most trusted subordinate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"John, you can't escape!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander stared at </span><span>him,</span><span> his eyes bright as if he had spotted his prey.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>John was stronger than Joseph and </span><span>Houtte</span><span>. Although Alexander didn't take him lightly, he was also prepared to give it his all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander held his breath and followed silently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, John, with his head down, turned into a small street, completely unaware that he was being followed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His disguise was indeed deceptive, and it was late at night, which made it relatively safe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>John met with Guzman every Friday. As the general manager of the trading center, he had many things to report to Guzman. Contacting only by phone was definitely not enough. It was also a way for him to express his loyalty to Guzman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew he might be under surveillance, so he often changed his routine for his weekly travel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Today, John didn't feel good, with a vague sense of foreboding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he didn't change his plan. He didn't bring any subordinates with him and used three cars as bait. He disguised himself and went to see Guzman alone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He believed such a plan must be foolproof. As long as those three cars left in different directions, any ill-intentioned surveillants outside would think John was in one of the cars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I wonder how Mr. Bryant is doing now. If Mr. Bryant can successfully promote to a white wizard, he can occupy an important position in the City of Sorcery, and the Brilliant Group will also be able to get the full support of the City of Sorcery in the future. After seeing Mr. Bryant later, I still need to meet that coquettish woman. This time, I must make her beg for mercy in bed..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>John was in a relaxed mood, thinking about the bright future of the Brilliant Group and his fantasies about women.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander had already approached John silently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With his current strength, his Force Sense could detect danger within hundreds of feet around him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After confirming again that John was alone and there were no traps, Alexander was ready to make his move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, John quickly walked into a quiet alley, which was pitch black inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander quickly detoured and walked towards John from the other end of the alley.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He walked with his head down, hunched over, and staggered, looking like a drunkard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>John soon saw Alexander walking towards him and was suddenly awakened from his fantasy, staring at Alexander warily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who!?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He never expected to meet someone here and immediately stared at Alexander fiercely like a wolf.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, John's sense of foreboding in his heart became stronger. He felt as if he had seen this approaching drunkard somewhere before, but he couldn't remember.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was dark in the alley, and John couldn't see his face clearly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander continued to stagger forward, shouting, "Drink up! Cheers... Ouch!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He suddenly tripped, and his body fell forward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander waved his hands in the air, seemingly to maintain his balance, leaving a series of mysterious gesture afterimages.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In fact, he was quietly taking action, using his Force Control.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>John had always been cautious and alert. Seeing Alexander almost fall, he </span><span>immediately let out a sigh of relief, thinking this was indeed a drunkard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, Alexander's gestures and some strange frequency attracted all of John's attention.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>John suddenly felt a buzzing in his head, as if he were also drunk, and even his thinking became slow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His vigilant eyes also began to fade, becoming lifeless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander had already arrived in front of John and pressed a palm on his forehead. The Force erupted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Immediately, the power of Force Control increased several times, making John's eyes darken quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, John's expression was still very struggling, and his body was shaking violently, seemingly trying to break free from some shackles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was surprised. He didn't expect that John had hidden his strength and hadn't been completely controlled yet.</span></p><div class="pagination">
