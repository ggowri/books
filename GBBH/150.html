  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander and Betty stepped into the office.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Boss, I've got everything you asked for," Betty said, handing over a hefty stack of documents.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She said, "Here are the details for the new headquarters."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she laid out the maps and descriptions, Alexander settled into his chair, meticulously flipping through the pages. His serious demeanor sent a thrill through Betty, igniting a spark of excitement within her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She leaned closer, her ample boobs brushing against his arm as she explained, "The estate is located to the north. It has great transport links, not too far from the city, and it's secluded enough to avoid any disturbances. We have nearly 10 million square feet of land, and there's even a dock..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander felt a surge of satisfaction at her words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew he had spent a fortune, but it was worth every penny.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was not just another office in a towering skyscraper like the Saint Group; it was a sprawling estate on the outskirts of </span><span>Loscity</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the magic powder gaining traction and sales skyrocketing, he couldn't keep up with production alone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His plan was to gather a trusted team and set up a large-scale production facility.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By sharing ninety percent of the magic powder formula with his crew, they could create semi-finished products.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander would then add the final missing ingredients to complete the powder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This way, he could ramp up production while keeping the core formula under wraps.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the Ultimate Alliance expanded alongside the magic powder, they would need to train more elite members, charting a different course than the Saint Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Boss, don't you want me at all?" Betty's voice broke through his thoughts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Alexander didn't respond, she boldly slid into his lap, whispering sweet nothings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caught off guard, Alexander struggled to find the right words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had sensed something was off earlier, and now, feeling her warmth against him, he realized her intentions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Betty, this isn't right... I have a girlfriend. Last time, it was because you were drugged..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before he could finish, Betty captured his lips with hers, her tongue expertly slipping </span><span>past his defenses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The kiss deepened, and as she did so, Betty deftly unbuttoned her crisp white shirt, revealing the tantalizing bobs barely contained by her bra.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Betty, we don't have a future together. You need to think this through!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander warned, his voice a mix of concern and desire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She pouted playfully, rolling her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, come on! You don't want to take responsibility?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's fine! You're so young, yet your thoughts are so rigid? I'm not looking for a future, just some fun in the moment."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's mind raced. She was right; he carried a heavy load of responsibilities and often played it too safe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Betty took his hand and placed it on her chest, grinning mischievously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How does it feel? Do you like it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander inhaled sharply, his body responding involuntarily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Honestly, since that last time, I've dreamed about you. You've got one of the best figures I've ever seen, second only to Ava."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, Alexander couldn't help but start to explore her softness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her chest was not just substantial; it was also delightfully supple and springy, making it a real treat to touch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Betty giggled, peppering his cheeks, forehead, and ears with kisses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Boss, I always thought you were the stoic type, but it turns out you're just a man show!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feeling a surge of playful defiance, Alexander retorted, "Who was it that seduced me first?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he leaned in and bit her nipples.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah! You're such a bad boy!" Betty exclaimed, her eyes sparkling with pride and delight as she trembled with excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She straddled Alexander's lap, her plump buttocks lifting slightly as she cooed, "You bad boy, I'm about to start."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander quivered with excitement as she mounted him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He embraced her alluring alabaster </span><span>hips</span><span>, letting Betty take control with wild abandon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Betty transformed into a true horsewoman. Biting her crimson lip, she galloped at breakneck speed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Deep, soul-searing ecstasy surged from within, sweeping them both away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Betty's fervor intensified. No man had ever pleased her so thoroughly, mentally and physically, as Alexander did.</span></p><div class="pagination">
