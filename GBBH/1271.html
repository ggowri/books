  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Relief washed over many faces in the room. By choosing to stay </span><span>here</span><span> instead of siding with Yinson and the Ghos</span><span>t</span><span>, they had already accepted they might not make it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Still, they had been worried sick about their families' safety. Now, with Byron's guarantee, their fighting spirit was burning hot&mdash;every single one of them was itching to lead their troops into battle and wipe these monsters off the face of the Earthia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Quiet down, everyone!" Byron's voice cut through the noise. His expression turned serious. "We're nowhere near the endgame yet, so we need to give this fight everything we've got."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He continued, "Even if things go south, our underground facilities will preserve humanity's survival. We won't let our species go extinct.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But the latest intel shows these monsters can evolve. The longer we drag this out, the tougher they'll become to deal with. Now move out!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone froze for a moment as Byron's words sank in. These monsters could evolve?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The news cast a heavy shadow over each general's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They quickly dispersed, rushing back to command their troops. Under Byron's leadership, they would wage war against both the monsters and the Ghost.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander escorted Melin to the top floor of the Ultimate Alliance headquarters, where they waited for their helicopter pickup.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aren't you coming with me to Treasure Island?" Melin asked, worry evident in her voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Once you're all safe on Treasure Island, I can focus on my next task," Alexander said with a slight smile. "I need to head to Risun and track down Yinson. He's the one behind all this. Maybe we can find a way to end this catastrophe." His expression grew serious as he finished speaking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Risun?" Melin started to protest but fell silent, unable to find the right words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead, she wrapped her arms around Alexander in a tight embrace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll be leaving for Treasure Island soon," she whispered. "Who knows when we'll see each other again?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melin wriggled against him, her body pressing into Alexander's.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said nothing, simply pulled her closer and captured her lips in a tender kiss, his right hand gently caressing her curves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mmm..." Melin's eyes fluttered closed, lost in the intoxicating kiss.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their passion ignited, and Melin suddenly pushed Alexander down onto the couch, straddling him with a playful grin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her cheeks flushed, she reached down and began to caress his cock, her delicate fingers teasing and exploring.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melin's eyes glazed over as she felt his cock getting hotter and bigger. Memories of their past encounters, of being swept away by pleasure, flooded her mind, and her touch grew even more tender.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hardened in her hand, and Melin lowered her head, her pink tongue tracing his cock from base to tip, as if savoring the most delicious ice cream.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She bathed him in her sweet saliva, her tongue swirling and pressing, her soft lips enveloping his cock completely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melin was completely lost in the moment, her earlobes flushed, a look of pure ecstasy on her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feeling the warmth of her mouth around his cock, Alexander sighed contentedly, "Well, well," he whispered, "your skills are getting better. Where did you learn that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melin let out a soft, seductive moan. "Don't worry," she whispered, looking up at him with a mischievous smile. "I haven't been with anyone else. I learned it from the movies. Do you like it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without waiting for an answer, Melin lowered her head again, her pink tongue swirling and dancing with mesmerizing skill.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her touch was so seductive, so practiced, that even Alexander couldn't help but marvel at her natural talent. It was hard to believe she'd never been with another man before him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melin's head bobbed up and down, her cherry lips stretched wide, though she could only take half of his cock in. Still, she persisted, determined to please him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melin moaned softly as she sucked Alexander's cock, so deep that her breath hitched in her throat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, the city of Loscity was a warzone. Gunfire echoed through the streets, punctuated by screams and the monstrous roars of creatures.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But here, in this quiet space, the only sounds were Melin's seductive sighs and the rhythmic slap of their bodies moving together.</span></p><div class="pagination">
