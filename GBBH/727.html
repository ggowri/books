  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With greed and lust in his eyes, Dick lewdly unbuttoned Ava's shirt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Dick untied the first button, Ava's plump boobs bounced with it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By the time he undid the second one, Ava's deep cleavage looked incredibly tantalizing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dick's eyes were wide, and the guys beside him kept licking their lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava struggled desperately, but she couldn't get free anyway. On the contrary, her gorgeous pretty was trembling more than ever, causing Dick's lust to burn wildly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Little bitch, as long as you don't struggle or scream, I won't kill you. Just serve us well, and I'll make sure you live a good life."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dick threatened Ava while untying her third button.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once he unbuttoned this one, Ava's boobs would be fully exposed, falling into his hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dick smiled lewdly and deliberately slowed down his movements.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava suddenly bent her knee and thrust upward, right between Dick's legs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dick covered his crotch and fell to the ground with a scream. He curled up his whole body in pain like a boiled prawn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The other men were stunned, and they rushed to help Dick up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a while, Dick finally came to his senses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He unbuckled his belt, pulled down his pants, and looked at the bruise. He was so furious that it hurt when he touched it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bitch! I was going to be gentle with you and not let them get you killed. Since you're so insensitive, I'll show you </span><span>now</span><span> what it means not to know good from bad."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dick waved his belt and screamed like a madman, "Strip her naked. You can enjoy her as much as you want and play her to death!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unexpectedly, Ava instantly got mad again and kicked Dick in the knee.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ouch!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dick fell down badly again, shivering in pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The others looked dumbfounded and remained stunned for a moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dick yelled frantically, "Are you all dumb? Go ahead and strip her naked. Do that thing to her!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With wide eyes, the men swallowed and gathered around Ava.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava closed her eyes in despair, wishing to kill herself immediately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, take her back when you guys are done. When we all get tired of playing with her, we can throw her to the tramps. She can only live in the gutter for the rest of her life!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dick's expression looked terrifying, as if he were a devil who had descended from hell to earth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the guys were about to touch Ava, an angry voice rang out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who is that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dick and the others turned to look around, and they were all startled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, a man wearing an ugly mask appeared not far away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the man approached, he limped. He was a cripple, carrying something black in his hand that looked to be a scabbard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it! You cripple, who told you to be nosy? Do you want to die?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dick threatened him viciously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bruno responded indifferently, "You guys wanted to rape her and throw her to the tramps to humiliate her, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dick sneered, "Cripple, do you like this bitch?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bruno's face under his mask flushed, and his heart raced.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The burly man, Jasper Page, stepped forward and swung his fist at Bruno.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Asshole, get the hell out of here right now, or I'll break your legs!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bruno looked at him coldly, and everyone could feel the mockery in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Cripple, I'll kill you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper growled and rushed at Bruno, kicking him severely in the stomach.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was 6.3 feet tall, and he had been in the military and was covered in muscle, so he was especially confident that he would kick Bruno out of the way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bruno, however, stood still and calmly watched as Jasper kicked at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Jasper was about to touch him with his foot, he suddenly froze in place, even his expression seemed to have frozen, which looked pretty weird.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Jasper, are you acting? Hurry up and kick him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dick urged impatiently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next second, everyone looked absolutely horrified.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jasper's body was split apart into a dozen pieces of flesh and a single head that fell to the ground with a loud thud.</span></p><div class="pagination">
