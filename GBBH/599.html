From now on, not only will I be a member of the Morris family, but our Red Umbrella Group and the Morris family will also be an alliance, growing stronger together."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Frederick said, "Very good. Megan, you must be nice to Felix. Felix, don't be angry. Megan is actually a very good person and is loyal to the Morris family."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix said, "Yes, I will follow your arrangements."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix lowered his head and looked honest, but no one noticed the resentment in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Very good. You should get along. Change into your wedding dresses now. The ceremony will begin soon."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Frederick patted Felix on the shoulder and </span><span>said</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm leaving. I have some things to take care of."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Megan said, "Felix, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to test you. This was all arranged by Mr. Frederick Morris, and I couldn't refuse."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Megan snuggled in Felix's arms and acted coquettishly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix stared at her with a complicated look, which made Megan feel flustered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said, "Well, I won't be angry."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He pinched Megan's buttocks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Frederick returned to the study again and ordered, "Call Weston over immediately."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a while, Weston walked into the study with steady steps.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Weston, are you ready?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Frederick asked solemnly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, sir. We are ready. The Tiger Strike Squad is fully deployed. If anyone tries to cause trouble at the wedding, they will die."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Weston answered with certainty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Frederick nodded with satisfaction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay, that's good. Our family hasn't had a wedding in a long time. We can't make fools of ourselves."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Morris family had been looking for orphans with excellent qualifications for many years.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They brought these children to the deserted mountains and arranged for instructors to train them severely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The instructors were all experts invited by the Morris family. And some of them were </span><span>even ruthless and notorious scums who used all kinds of cruel methods to train these orphans.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These orphans were proficient in killing techniques, wilderness survival skills, making weapons using local materials, etc.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As a result of the brutal training, 80% of these orphans died every year.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The youngest were seven or eight years old, and the older ones were about ten years old. Not only did they have to fight against the harsh weather and environment, but they also had to fight against wild beasts frequently. The most dangerous was the killing of each other.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Morris family was so cruel that they not only adopted the last-in-first-out system, but also the hunting system and so on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These rules left only a handful of orphans after each group had been trained and fought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After these people managed to survive with great difficulty, they formed the Tiger Strike Squad, which was a trump card of the Morris family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The members of the Tiger Strike Squad didn't even have names and just used numbers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These orphans had been brainwashed. They were loyal to the Morris family and were willing to give their lives for them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if Frederick asked them to die immediately, they would not hesitate at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Frederick said, "Weston, be careful."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, sir. I will be cautious."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Weston had a fierce expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked down on Felix, but he did not dare to resist Frederick's orders.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Weston left. Frederick was alone in the study.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Frederick poured a glass of whiskey and drank it all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A warm feeling spread over him, and he felt comfortable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Felix... Alexander... You are all stepping stones for my family to become greater!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, wedding music was playing outside. The wedding of Felix and Megan began.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A strange and sinister laugh was heard in the study, which made people shudder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A mile away from the Morris House, the Morris family temporarily built a small camp to receive representatives from some surrounding organizations who came to attend the wedding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander had already received the news of the marriage between Felix and the Morris family halfway through the journey.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He and Augusta had already met up. They walked into the camp with gifts, while the others were waiting outside the camp.</span></p><div class="pagination">
