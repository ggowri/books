  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although the pill was only the size of a peanut, a gust of wind immediately filled the air with a strange and foul stench, making people feel dizzy and nauseous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This showed how potent the Multipoison Pill was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, this is a witch's poison I concocted based on ancient witchcraft, using thirteen species of venomous snakes, nine species of scorpions, and other deadly substances."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even if someone were to smell it from a distance, they could potentially be poisoned. You </span><span>take</span><span> it in front of everyone. Let's see if you can withstand it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Skyla's words frightened many people into backing away. They covered their noses with their sleeves, afraid of inhaling the foul stench of the Multipoison Pill.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Enough chatter." Alexander shot her a glance and directly took the Multipoison Pill, popping it into his mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Force enveloped the Multipoison Pill again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As long as Alexander did not withdraw the Force, the poison would be isolated from his body and could not harm him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You... Why aren't you dead? This is impossible," Skyla stammered, seeing that Alexander showed no reaction after consuming the pill.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Someone! Help..." Alexander suddenly gestured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Skyla's eyes lit up, thinking that Alexander must be in trouble and wanted someone to save him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone was startled, their eyes wide as they watched Alexander, wondering what he intended to do.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava's mind went blank, feeling as if the world was spinning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bring me a cup of coffee. The taste of this medicine is too bad. It's hard to swallow. I need some coffee to rinse my mouth," Alexander ordered his subordinates.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone was stunned again. "Alexander is completely fine and even thinking about drinking coffee."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Skyla was furious. "Alexander, are you deliberately playing with me? Never mind, I still have more potent poisons."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander sipped his coffee while disdainfully snorted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Show me all your tricks, or you won't have the chance later. Let me see what the Vanderbilt family is capable of."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's deep and cold gaze locked onto Skyla, making her shiver uncontrollably.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is venom extracted from a jellyfish. Do you dare to eat it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Skyla presented her trump card.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smirked contemptuously and, without hesitation, poured the venom into his mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The scene erupted in commotion, with people whispering among themselves. Some were excited, some were curious, and others found it unbelievable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anything else? Bring it out, or it will be your turn."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander strode towards Skyla with confidence, closing in step by step.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Skyla trembled uncontrollably.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You... What do you want to do? I still have poison powder made from five species of venomous spiders. Do you dare to eat it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Show me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under Alexander's pressure, Skyla reluctantly produced one poison after another, including many ingredients for concocting witch's poisons.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, no matter what poison she presented, Alexander swallowed it without hesitation, leaving everyone in awe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is that all? Nothing left?" Alexander asked with a cold smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In no time, he had consumed over a dozen deadly substances, but the poisons were all enveloped by the Force, causing him no harm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Skyla was speechless, filled with fear, anger, and despair. She thought, "Is this guy even human? These poisons could kill thousands of people. He consumed them all and not only is he unharmed, but he can still smile."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not only was Skyla in despair, but Arlene was also drenched in cold sweat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She felt Alexander's smile was terrifying, like a wolf in sheep's clothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, Arlene's eyes lit up, thinking, "Alexander is truly extraordinary. He's definitely worth winning over. He could help me become the head of the Vanderbilt family."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Arlene had a half-brother, and her father would undoubtedly pass the Vanderbilt family to her brother, not her, a woman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Arlene stared intently at Alexander, pondering how to use him and make him work for her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander chuckled and took out a black pill, saying, "Now it's your turn, Ms. Vanderbilt. Please consume this."</span></p><div class="pagination">
