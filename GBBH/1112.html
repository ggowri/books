  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Tap, tap, tap...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With a calm smile, Alexander took slow, measured steps toward Howard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Howard, his face pale with fear, spun his wheelchair backward, desperate to escape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What are you idiots doing? Get him! Kill him!" Howard shouted hoarsely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>There were three bodyguards with him, including the driver. They looked at each other, visibly shaken and unsure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Get him! Kill this bastard, and I'll reward you with ten million dollars!" Howard screamed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The mention of ten million dollars immediately caught the bodyguards' attention. Greed took hold, and their bloodlust began to rise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander sneered, his voice cold and controlled. "You're willing to die for ten million? You're not even worth the dust on my shoes."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Howard screamed again, desperation fueling his words, "Kill him now, and I'll give you twenty million!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At the doubled reward, the bodyguards' eyes went wide with greed, and they rushed at Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander shook his head. It was pointless trying to reason with them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After a few brief screams, the bodyguards were left in pools of blood. Alexander stood motionless, as though nothing had happened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Howard, trembling violently, screamed in terror, "Stop! Stay away from me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He desperately spun his wheelchair, trying to escape, but his arms were weak, and the chair moved sluggishly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With a swift motion, Alexander grabbed Howard by the neck, lifting him off the ground effortlessly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ugh! Let go of me..." Howard gasped, struggling in vain as his expression turned from defiance to pure terror.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You think you can kill me?" Alexander's voice dripped with contempt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Howard's face went pale and then turned an unhealthy shade of black as his body began to tremble uncontrollably from lack of oxygen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Pathetic," Alexander sneered, tightening his grip.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Crack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The sickening sound of Howard's neck snapping echoed in the quiet, and his body went limp.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With a disdainful flick of his wrist, Alexander threw Howard's lifeless form to the ground like discarded trash.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Without a second glance, Alexander ignited pale flames on Howard's corpse. His powers had grown stronger since advancing to a higher level as an Advanced Warrior, and his Force was now capable of burning with a fiercer intensity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In moments, flames engulfed the area, and the motorcycles around them exploded in bursts of fire. The fire raged fiercely, and by the time the police arrived, there was nothing left but charred remnants scattered by the wind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Later, on the way home...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander kept a close eye on the news, noticing a rising number of world leaders falling victim to "accidents." He couldn't help but wonder how Yinson was orchestrating these events. Not every leader who was poisoned was as fortunate as Gavin, who had managed to get help from Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander didn't consider himself a savior, though. What mattered now was accelerating his plans for Treasure Island and Devil Island, getting them fully operational.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As for the poisoned leaders, they were powerful figures. They wouldn't die so easily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Just then, his phone buzzed. It was a call from Chief Oliver at the police station.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Hello, Mr. Benton," Alexander answered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne, where are you?" Oliver's voice sounded strained.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'm on my way home. What's going on?" Alexander could hear the urgency in Oliver's voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"It's complicated, Mr. Hawthorne. Please come to the station right away. Ms. Ward is in trouble, and we need you to check on her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ms. Ward?" Alexander frowned, his mind racing. "Melin?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Yes, Mr. Hawthorne. She hasn't shown up at the station for three days. I sent officers to her house, and she's locked herself in her room. She seems highly stressed," Oliver explained urgently. "I'm worried about her. If something's wrong, we know you're close to her, and I'm afraid you'll take matters into your own hands if it gets worse."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Three days without coming to the station and highly stressed..." Alexander muttered, a chill creeping up his spine. His mind raced. Was Yinson involved? But that didn't make sense. Ava was the one Yinson cared about most, not Melin. His relationship with Melin was more like that of a close confidant.</span></p><div class="pagination">
