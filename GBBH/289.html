  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Alexander finally found Ava, she had already been waiting for quite a while.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What took you so long? Where's Lara?" Ava asked, sounding a bit annoyed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smiled slightly and began recounting everything. How he treated Ralph, met Quentin, and discovered Orion's and the maid's plot to poison Ralph.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Of course, he skipped over the intimate parts with Lara.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So that's what happened. I can't believe so much has gone on," Ava said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a sudden realization, Ava asked worriedly, "Are you confident you can cure Quentin's grandson? If you win over this four-star general, dealing with Schroder will be much easier."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander replied, "His grandson is in </span><span>Tijuanea</span><span>, and it seems like sorcery is needed to stabilize his condition. It's probably more than just a simple illness. I can't be completely sure until I see him myself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Regardless, I won't let Schroder's scheme succeed!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava nodded and then sneered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Schroder dared to impersonate the military in issuing orders. That's a serious offense in the army, and Quentin will definitely teach him a lesson."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander let out a faint snort.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I want more than just to teach him a lesson. Since he dared to challenge me, I'll make sure he's ruined for good!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava was startled. Schroder was a lieutenant general and a key figure in Northern Command. Quentin might reprimand him, but he wouldn't go so far as to destroy him completely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She said, "If you can cure Quentin's grandson, Schroder might not be ruined forever, but he certainly wouldn't dare mess with us again."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smiled calmly, knowing Ava was underestimating his abilities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If not for the sake of his loved ones and friends, Alexander wouldn't have hesitated to finish Schroder off tonight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava warned, "Jane has gotten close to Schroder, so you'd better be careful!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander shook his head, giving a disdainful smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Fairfax family is trying to ally with a tiger. It won't end well for them!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After losing millions, the Fairfax family had moved out of their mansion. Now, over 30 family members lived in a rundown, small estate in the suburbs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a remote and dilapidated place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was the ancestral home from before their wealth, now in ruins due to years of neglect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why aren't they back yet? Did something happen?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Frank was very anxious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Andrew, Belinda, Jane, and several other key Fairfax family members had gone to the banquet and had since lost contact.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was now past 2 AM, and still no news.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Frank lamented with regret, "I told them not to stir things up and just be honest. Now look, something's happened again!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone was silent, unsure of what to say.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bang!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The front door was suddenly kicked open, startling everyone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, well, did you all gather here waiting for me to arrest you? Makes things easier for me," a burly, fully armed man sneered as he stepped inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Rosen Gross, Schroder's personal guard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Behind Rosen, dozens of armed men barged in, looking vicious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who are you people? What do you want?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Frank glared at them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Fairfax family might have fallen, but Frank still wanted to preserve their dignity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Heh, </span><span>you</span><span> old geezer got guts. I like that," Rosen sneered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a sinister grin, Rosen slapped him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Slap!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Frank fell hard to the ground, his cheek quickly swelling up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Cuff them all and take them away!" Rosen ordered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At Rosen's command, the dozens of men surged forward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Fairfax family cowered, trembling, not daring to resist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What... What do you want? Did you capture my son and granddaughter too?" Frank asked angrily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosen's gaze was filled with malice as he sneered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We're General Flores' men. If you want to blame someone, blame Alexander for once being your daughter's husband."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment he said this, the room erupted in shock.</span></p><div class="pagination">
