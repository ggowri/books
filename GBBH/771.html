  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander chuckled quietly, watching her with a calm, amused gaze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Suddenly, the woman's expression softened into a flirtatious smile, like a blossoming rose, shedding all her previous hostility.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She giggled, her tone coy as she addressed Alexander. "You must be Mr. Hawthorne, right? So young, so charming&mdash;and quite capable, too. After all, you managed to make even our esteemed elder Rock disappear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Oh, pardon my manners. I should introduce myself&mdash;I'm Yvonne Baird, one of the Elders from the City of Sorcery. Don't be alarmed; I've changed my mind. I'm not here to fight you. In fact, I want to propose a little partnership."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander's interest was piqued. "And what kind of partnership wo</span><span>uld that be?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Oh, something beneficial to both of us. All you need to do is help me take down Monica and make me the ruler of the City of Sorcery. If you do, I'll reward you handsomely... and I wouldn't mind personally showing you my gratitude," she purred, casting a playful glance his way, her eyes heavy with allure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She even let her tongue slip out, slowly licking her bright red lips in a shameless attempt to seduce him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You want to be the ruler of the City of Sorcery and expect me to join forces with you against Monica?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander looked at her in mild surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Yes, exactly! I want you to join forces with me. With your strength, you could easily kill Monica."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yvonne took a step closer, reaching out as if to grab his arm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Immediately, a sense of danger surged within Alexander&mdash;a Warrior's instinct never lied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But he stayed calm, activating his All-seeing Eyes, which flashed briefly, revealing Yvonne's deceitful tricks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Just as Yvonne's hand was about to reach him, Alyssa, sensing something amiss, quickly warned, "Be careful!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She didn't trust Yvonne; the woman's expression was peculiar, with a sinister glint hiding beneath her smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander felt a sharp sting in his arm where Yvonne's fingers had briefly touched him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A sudden wave of dizziness hit, and he felt unsteady on his feet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"So this is your plan, Yvonne? You talk of collaboration, and yet you try to poison me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yvonne laughed, her voice dripping with mock sweetness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Oh, I am still proposing a partnership, but with me firmly in control. That prick you felt was my poison. If you don't comply with my orders, your body will rot from the inside out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"So from now on, you'll be my loyal servant," she sneered, extending her hand to reveal a slender blue needle tucked between her fingers&mdash;the very needle she'd used to inject him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Now, Alexander, kneel before me and surrender your potion formulas and all your wealth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Defy me, and I'll make you wish for death." Yvonne threatened viciously, like a greedy devil.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander merely smirked. "You want me to kneel, to hand over my treasures? You must have an inflated sense of yourself."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander had already sensed Yvonne's treachery; with the Force coursing through him, he was immune to her poison.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As soon as the poison attempted to take hold, the Force within him eradicated it entirely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As Yvonne continued to gloat, he was already completely unaffected.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Alexander, you've been poisoned! Do you want to die? Get down on your knees!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing Alexander standing unharmed, Yvonne grew frantic. Her beautiful face contorted with rage, resembling a monster straight out of a twisted fairy tale.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Bang! Bang!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Two gunshots rang out, and bullets struck the ground near Yvonne's feet, leaving small craters.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yvonne jolted back in shock. She wasn't capable of dodging bullets like Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Undo the poison on my boss, or I'll blow you away," Alyssa threatened, her expression hard as she leveled an automatic rifle at Yvonne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her hatred for this devious woman was evident; if Alexander hadn't been poisoned, Alyssa would have already shot her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Alexander simply laughed, waving his hand. "No need for an antidote. I'm perfectly fine."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alyssa blinked in disbelief. "Boss, you're really alright?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Yes, I'm absolutely fine."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander nodded, stepping toward Yvonne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A deadly aura emanated from him, chilling Yvonne to the core. She began to sweat, panic flashing across her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You... you're not poisoned? That's impossible! Stop! If you come any closer, I'll trigger the poison in your body!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander's lips curled in disdain, unfazed by her threats.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You're so eager for death? Fine by me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Realizing her last chance was slipping away, Yvonne's eyes gleamed with malice as she attempted to activate the poison in him.</span></p><div class="pagination">
