  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Maybe you should just stop pressing it..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava's cheeks flushed a deeper shade of red.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">From Alexander's vantage point, he could clearly see beneath her skirt, and the position was undeniably embarrassing for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'm your boyfriend; there's no need to be shy," Alexander reassured her, his words both warm and comforting.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Um..." Ava found herself nodding gently, unable to resist the soothing pressure of his hands on her feet.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As he massaged her, Alexander employed the Force, using a special technique to stimulate her foot and calf muscles, sending waves of relaxation through her body.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"That feels amazing..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava couldn't help but let out a soft sigh of pleasure.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just then, the office door swung open, and the secretary walked in.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Ms. Blackburn, I have a few documents..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She froze mid-sentence at the sight of Alexander cradling Ava's feet, who looked utterly blissed out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Uh... Ms. Blackburn, I'm so sorry!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The secretary quickly turned on her heel and dashed out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava's embarrassment peaked, and she playfully nudged Alexander's face with her foot.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"This is all your fault! Now people will think..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander chuckled, giving her thigh a gentle squeeze. "Darling, your legs are just so sexy."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava's face turned crimson as she quickly pulled her foot back and adjusted her skirt.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You should go find Billy and handle some business. I still have documents to sign."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Don't worry, I've got everything under control," Alexander said, flashing her an 'OK' sign as he exited the office.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava watched him leave, a dreamy smile creeping onto her face as she pondered her thoughts.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">*****</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Meanwhile, the Brilliant Group had made it clear. The perpetrator must pay in blood!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Sebastian landed in Loscity on his private jet, rushing straight to the hospital.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the hospital room, he grasped his son's hand, tears streaming down his face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Son, I'm so sorry I couldn't protect you!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Dad, you have to make Alexander lift the curse! You have to help me get revenge..." Theodore sobbed, desperation lacing his words.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Seeing his son in such a pitiful state filled Sebastian with a mix of anger and urgency.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Don't worry, son. I'll make sure Alexander pays. If he doesn't lift the curse, I'll make his life a living hell.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Just rest for now. Leave everything to me," Sebastian reassured Theodore before hurrying out of the hospital.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Sebastian's mission in Loscity was twofold. Save his son and eliminate Alexander.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But there was another crucial task at hand&mdash;he needed to secure the formula for the magic powder. If it spread, the foundation of the Brilliant Group would crumble.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Back at his home, Alexander summoned Billy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"This is my newly formulated magic powder. If Ava approaches you about a partnership, offer her the price I've given you, but don't mention that I'm the creator," Alexander instructed, placing several bags of vibrant blue powder on the table.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Of course, boss. Whatever you say."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Billy nodded, though he felt a pang of regret at the thought of the Saint Group snatching away such a lucrative opportunity.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"By the way, didn't you mention needing some skilled hands? I've got a lead on a retired Phantom Squad captain, Augusta Dent, but..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Billy hesitated, a wry smile crossing his face. "He's disabled, and his wife is seriously ill, so they're in a tough spot. I wanted to get your thoughts. If you don't mind his disability, he could be a real asset."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander's interest was piqued. "Even with a disability, his combat skills must be top-notch. I can help with his wife's medical needs.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Let's go meet him. I want to hear how he got injured."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Billy quickly led the way, recounting the story as they walked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Three years ago, Augusta's team was on a counter-terrorism mission when they walked into an ambush. Two of his men were killed in the explosion. Augusta and the rest of the team managed to fight their way out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But apparently, someone high up leaked their position. When Augusta went to confront the higher-ups, he and the remaining three members were dismissed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Because they angered the brass, they didn't even get their retirement benefits. Augusta's wife got cancer, so they had to sell their house and now live in a slum."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Soon, they arrived at a run-down hospital that looked both outdated and shabby.</p><div class="pagination">
