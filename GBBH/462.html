  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava was in a black off-shoulder bodycon dress that hugged her curves just right. Her chest was high and full, the deep line of her cleavage enough to make anyone's heart race.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her waist was slim, practically begging to be held, and her long, toned legs had Timothy feeling a little dizzy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He watched as Alexander casually wrapped an arm around Ava, his hand resting on her hip.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Gulp."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Timothy swallowed hard a few times; jealousy clearly written across his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava rolled her eyes at him, scoffing in disdain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Timothy broke into a cold sweat, quickly opening the car door for Alexander and Ava before driving off toward the hotel at top speed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a few minutes, they arrived at their suite.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's tone was cold as he asked, "What's the Mafia boss, SATAN, been up to lately?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Timothy gave a helpless smile, "Boss, I'm just a small-timer&mdash;I usually don't hear anything that sensitive. But I swear, I'll try my best, and as soon as I catch wind of </span><span>something, you'll be the first to know."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Useless. Get lost!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander waved him off with a scowl.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, of course, I'm leaving now..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Timothy grabbed Arthur and the others and left, looking like he'd just been kicked around.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once they were far from the room, Arthur couldn't help but grumble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tim, are we really </span><span>gonna</span><span> let Alexander push us around forever?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Timothy flinched, quickly covering Arthur's mouth and hissing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shut up! You trying to get us both killed?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The memory of that deep, bone-breaking pain came back to him&mdash;the way it felt like his whole body was about to split apart&mdash;and he couldn't stop the shudder that ran through him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We're the fish, and he's got the knife. Alexander is too powerful. If we don't want to end up in agony, we have to do as he says."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Timothy let out a long sigh, his voice filled with resignation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Alexander was busy comforting Ava.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Look, I get it, your mom might've been a bit wild back then, but that was after your dad passed. It's been ages; you don't have to keep holding onto that anger."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava shot him a look, her voice calm but firm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She had me young, and she's still a beautiful woman. I bet she's got more men hanging around her now than she ever did."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander couldn't help but laugh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What're you laughing at? I need some fresh air."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava snapped, pushing him away and heading toward the hotel's fitness area, clearly deep in thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander didn't argue, patiently following behind her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This really was a five-star hotel&mdash;high-end saunas, baths, and a well-equipped gym.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every kind of fitness machine you could think of, all in a nice, quiet space.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava had always loved yoga and working out, and since she'd never trained with Alexander before, she was excited to drag him along, both of them changing clothes and heading into the gym.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander started messing around with barbells.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The 200-kilogram barbell was nothing to him&mdash;clean lifts, overhead presses; he handled it all with ease.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava was on the treadmill, her black yoga outfit hugging her curves, making her already stunning figure even more eye-catching.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Especially her full chest, bouncing lightly with each step, drawing glances from all the men around.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smiled, amused, knowing full well that the woman they were all ogling was his and his alone. The sense of pride was unmistakable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey, you! What do you think you're staring at? Want me to pop your eyes out?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, a sour voice interrupted the moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A young guy in a suit stood there, glaring daggers at Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander didn't miss a beat, "I'm staring at a gorgeous woman&mdash;what's it to you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The guy pointed a finger at Alexander, sneering.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't have time for you right now but mark my words&mdash;I'll deal with you later."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He tossed out his threat, then immediately put on a smile and walked over to Ava.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava turned, a look of surprise flashing across her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Nate? What're you doing here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ava! I should be the one asking you that! The famous campus beauty, here in </span><span>Tijuanea</span><span>?" Nate Sullivan, Ava's old friend in college, smiled, holding out his hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Nate, I haven't seen you since graduation&mdash;it's been years."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava extended her hand, her tone nostalgic. Nate had spent three years chasing her back in college.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as their hands were about to meet...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hold it right there!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander grabbed Ava's hand, pulling her into his arms, smiling casually.</span></p><div class="pagination">
