Her drug addiction was about to strike, and it was really painful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The old man appeared like a ghost.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ella, if you dare to expose Mr. Vanderbilt's plan, I make sure you and your family will suffer."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ella was in tears, not daring to say a word.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come on, Mr. Vanderbilt wants to see you! It's about time your addiction kicked in. You can ask Mr. Vanderbilt, and maybe you can get more drugs. Ha-ha."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The old man sneered and opened the car door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ella didn't even dare to resist and got in the car obediently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a large mountain villa by the sea, Felix sat in an incredibly luxurious chair, crossed his legs, and puffed out a cloud of smoke.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking about the recent events on Treasure Island, he was somehow annoyed and couldn't afford to lose Treasure Island.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maybe Cloe was behind this!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix was a bit anxious to check out Treasure Island for himself, but the plan to deal with Alexander was nearing its end.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had to grab Ashley and Ava, and Alexander would surely hand over the recipe for the magic powder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, he'd kill Alexander, and he could rightfully be the old man's only heir.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why hasn't Ella arrived yet?

She couldn't resist and could only go against the grain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, Ella had felt more joy than she'd ever felt before with the combination of the drug and Felix's stimulation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ella felt so humiliated. Even though she was forced to do it, from that moment on, even though she tried her best to resist, she could never forget the feeling of pleasure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In just a few days, her mental defenses completely collapsed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I know. I'll go change later..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ella lowered her head deeply, unconsciously feeling limp and numb between her legs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Larry sneered at the sight of her confusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're such a little bitch!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hurry up and stop being in a daze. If Mr. Vanderbilt gets mad, you'll be in trouble."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay, I got it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ella walked fast to the changing room beside her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The changing room was ten square feet with closets and fitting mirrors on all four sides.</span></p><div class="pagination">
