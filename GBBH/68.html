  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander hadn't put Betty in Ava's villa; instead, he rented a nearby apartment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He knew that moving in on his own turf and setting up his own operation was a risk, especially without knowing Ava's stance. He wouldn't take the chance of spilling any details prematurely.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The next day, Alexander called Billy over with a simple phone call.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When Billy arrived, eager and all smiles, Alexander tossed a few packets of blue "magic powder" onto the table.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Boss, what's this stuff?" Billy asked, trying to sound as friendly as possible.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander gave a mysterious smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"This is magic powder. It can replace all the drugs on the market, but it won't harm the body at all."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Billy blinked, momentarily confused.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He thought, "Are we doing drug trafficking?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander continued, "I'm only asking you for 100 thousand dollars for these. Whatever you sell them for is up to you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Considering the potential value of the powder, it was a steal at that price.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Though Billy was nominally one of Alexander's men, money was always a strong motivator.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Billy's face fell.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He thought, "The blue powder looks suspiciously like poison. A hundred thousand dollars upfront? Claiming no side effects? Who will buy into that? There is no guarantee it would even sell."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Boss, is this really a new type of drug?" Billy asked cautiously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander's eyes narrowed. "I told you, it's not a drug. It's harmless and even boosts health. If you don't believe me, take some and try it yourself."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Billy laughed nervously and didn't press the matter further.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Despite his reservations, he handed over 100 thousand dollars to Alexander without a fuss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander, his expression serious, reminded Billy, "I plan to use this powder to undermine the Brilliant Group's new product and mess up their alliance plans. You need to push this quickly!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Billy didn't argue, though he was clearly disgruntled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Once outside the villa, he couldn't help but grumble, "A hundred thousand for this junk? And he says it's good for you. Who's gonna believe that?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">One of his men asked, "Billy, is this really a move into the drug market? That's the Brilliant Group's turf. We'll definitely end up clashing with them."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Billy scoffed, saying, "You don't get it! This powder might just be a ruse. Alexander's real goal is probably to test me and make a quick buck.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It's a common trick among big shots. Unlike me, who's actually kind to you all."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The men nodded in agreement, grateful for Billy's supposed kindness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Billy sighed, "Well, under the circumstances, I have to stick with the Saint Group.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"We're just small players compared to them."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His men echoed his sentiment, clearly in agreement.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When Billy got back, he divided the powder among his crew.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Alright, everyone, let's try this stuff and see what it's really about!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Each of them took a bit and quickly showed an astonished expression.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It tastes great, melts right in your mouth!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"There's a warm sensation spreading through my body, and I feel more alive."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The group grew more excited as they experienced the effects.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Quick, get Lucy and the others here, and bring more women!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As soon as Billy gave the order, a parade of flashy, scantily dressed women began to file in.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Before long, the room was a scene of unrestrained revelry.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Billy felt unusually invigorated. He lasted over an hour without any of the usual aches or exhaustion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Instead, he felt energized and powerful.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The experience was nothing short of royal indulgence, an unparalleled pleasure that surpassed anything he had ever felt.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Damn! The boss is really onto something with this powder. We're going to make a fortune."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Billy was over the moon.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His men chattered excitedly, comparing the powder to anything else on the market and declaring it the new gold standard. They insisted that they'd only use this magic powder from now on and never touch anything else.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Hahaha! With this powder, the Brilliant Group doesn't stand a chance. We'll corner the entire market!" Billy boasted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He quickly instructed his team to start promoting the powder in bars, nightclubs, and other hot spots.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He even divided the powder into dozens of smaller, elegantly packaged gift boxes and had them sent to the high rollers in Loscity's elite circles.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Before long, Billy's phone was blowing up with messages and calls.</p><div class="pagination">
