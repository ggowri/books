  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander gripped his Lightsabers as the Force surged through him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The blade extended to its maximum length, stretching nearly six feet long.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The brilliant beam swept through the air,</span><span> and</span><span> instantly several mutant beasts</span><span> </span><span>dropp</span><span>ed</span><span>, each cleanly sliced in half.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These mutant beasts were normally tough as hell. One would need a barrage of bullets hitting vital spots to take one down. But against the Lightsabers, they split apart like butter under a hot knife.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>William and Logan flanked Alexander, their rifles blazing without hesitation as they cleared the monsters from his sides and rear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The three-man strike team carved through the beast tide like a spear through flesh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Augusta's team kept up their suppressing fire. The white phosphorus rounds had thrown the beasts into chaos, with countless burning beasts running wild and causing even more panic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Some of the monsters tried to roll on the ground to put out the flames.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was pointless&mdash;the white phosphorus was relentless, turning their bodies into living bonfires that only burned brighter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But even more mutant beasts surged forward, launching themselves at Alexander's team.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Logan and William were under immense pressure. If it wasn't for Alexander cutting through most of the mutant beasts like they were nothing, the two would have been overwhelmed by now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, the air erupted with the rapid-fire sound of gunshots and explosions from another direction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Marvin's team. They'd flanked around to launch a fierce assault on the beast tide from </span><span>the</span><span> third </span><span>direction</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their combination of artillery fire, heavy machine guns, and white phosphorus rounds instantly took down over a thousand mutant beasts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now!" Alexander shouted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wasn't about to waste this perfect opportunity. With a battle cry and a powerful stomp, he launched himself like a human cannonball into the fray.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blood sprayed wherever he passed. Every mutant beast, regardless of size, was reduced to chunks in his wake.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By the time the others could track his movement again, Alexander had already covered dozens of yards and was facing off against a mutant ape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The nearly seven-foot-tall creature actually showed fear in its eyes, trying to turn tail and run.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But with one flash of the Lightsabers, the ape's massive body was cleaved in two.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The mutant's mangled corpse collapsed to the ground in a bloody heap.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once this mutant monkey was dead, the hundred-plus beasts surrounding it suddenly seemed lost, like soldiers without their commander. They stared at Alexander, terror evident in their eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Alexander resumed his attack, the mutated beasts actually turned tail and ran.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was the first time since the battle began that any of them had fled. Alexander's gamble had paid off&mdash;the mutant monkey had indeed been their commander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the real key was the monkey alpha in the center of the beasts. Taking it down would break the entire swarm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's expression hardened as he quickly dodged to the side.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A putrid stench swept past him as another mutant monkey attempted a sneak attack from behind, its razor-sharp claws slicing through empty air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The creature landed on all fours and darted away like lightning, taking cover behind several other beasts. It fixed Alexander with a vicious glare.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With those blood-red eyes, it looked every bit as terrifying as a demon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smirked. These mutant monkeys might have gotten smarter, but they still couldn't match human intelligence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Another mutant monkey began circling him at high speed, clearly waiting for an opening to strike.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A shot rang out, and an energy-infused sniper bullet exploded the mutant ape's head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The unfortunate mutant ape had focused all its attention on Alexander, making it an easy target for William's deadly shot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Its massive head burst like a smashed watermelon, spraying red and white matter everywhere.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dozens of mutant beasts, driven by the mutant ape's commands, began closing in on Alexander, trying to trap him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander showed no fear as he charged toward the horde with his saber raised.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His senses expanded to their limits, and his deep eyes seemed to contain spinning whirlpools of power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The world around him slowed to a crawl. Even without using the Force to create a barrier, Alexander found the mutant beasts' movements painfully slow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In his mind, he mapped out everything&mdash;the attack patterns of dozens of mutant beasts, their speed, their movement paths, and the most efficient ways to strike them down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every detail crystallized in Alexander's mind with perfect clarity.</span></p><div class="pagination">
