  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the entrance of the Marriott Hotel, several black sedans were lined up, clearly waiting for someone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the middle car sat a stunning beauty with skin as tender as a peach, radiating maturity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She stared at the hotel entrance, her delicate brows furrowed, her watery eyes filled with doubt and worry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beside her sat a heavily made-up, seductive woman, chattering away in complaints.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Brittany, can that Alexander really </span><span>cure</span><span> your brother?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My uncle is a gray wizard from the City of Sorcery. Even he couldn't do it, so how could a guy from </span><span>Loscity</span><span> possibly succeed?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A hint of displeasure flashed across Brittany's pretty face; her best friend was being too presumptuous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Alexander walked out of the hotel with large strides, scanning the area before heading straight towards them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It must be him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brittany curiously observed Alexander, recalling what he looked like in the photos.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beside her, her best friend wore a disdainful expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He looks so young, hardly even an adult. How could he possibly treat your brother? Did your grandfather make a mistake..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shut up!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brittany scolded. "Madison, even though you're my friend and the granddaughter of Mr. Johnson, you can't belittle my grandfather like that."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Brittany, I'm sorry! I didn't mean it..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Madison's expression changed; she couldn't afford to offend Quentin's eldest granddaughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brittany got out of the car and greeted Alexander with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander noticed her immediately; she was wearing a beautiful white dress, her figure sexy and captivating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't help but think to himself, "So beautiful!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hello, I'm Alexander. I thought Walter was here to pick me up, but instead, I see a beautiful lady."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hello, Mr. Hawthorne. I'm Brittany; Quentin is my grandfather."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After they introduced themselves, they shook hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feeling the warmth of Alexander's hand, Brittany's face turned slightly red; she rarely had physical contact with men.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Madison scrutinized Alexander with a critical gaze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're so young; can you really treat Brittany's brother?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can't guarantee it now, but I'm confident."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander sensed her hostility and was too lazy to say more, following Brittany to get into the car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Madison disdainfully said, "I think you're just here to scam money, aren't you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander glanced at Madison, a dismissive smile appearing on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Through Force Sense, he understood that this woman was not clean.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Miss, I was invited by Mr. Thompson. Questioning me is the same as questioning Mr. Thompson."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's words left Madison speechless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Madison was still unwilling to back down and sneered,</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm just concerned. If you go and can't help, won't that delay the patient's treatment?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander rolled his eyes at her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You'd better mind your own business and manage yourself. With such a chaotic private life, your condition is already quite serious and will only get worse."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brittany looked at Alexander in surprise; she didn't expect him to say such things.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Madison was shocked; Alexander was right and had seen through everything. She indeed had a hidden ailment from being too close to men.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she wouldn't admit it and angrily retorted, "My private life is chaotic? You're slandering me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was so furious that she wanted to slap Alexander, but suddenly, she felt a cramp in her lower abdomen, causing intense pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ouch..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Madison crouched down, clutching her stomach, her body breaking out in cold sweat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madison, are you really sick?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brittany was shocked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Madison still stubbornly denied having any illness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Brittany, I'm just having menstrual cramps; this guy is talking nonsense..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander sneered and said, "That kind of ailment can't be cured and will have extremely serious consequences, even making it impossible for you to have children in the future."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brittany felt that what Alexander said was harsh and hard to believe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne, please stop defaming my friend. How could you diagnose her just by looking?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Alexander was full of confidence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Whether I slandered her or not, she knows it in her heart. It's her own fault that she has a chaotic private life and doesn't pay attention to safety measures. She deserves it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Madison's heart was filled with fear because Alexander was absolutely right.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How did he know this about her on their first meeting?</span></p><div class="pagination">
