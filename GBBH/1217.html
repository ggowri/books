  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"With you on the team, I'm confident we'll be unstoppable! We'll secure the raw Immortality Serum and develop a plan after studying it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quentin clenched his fists in excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's go. See you during the operation."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander left the room, with Quentin hurrying to follow behind him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After leaving the room, Alexander arrived at the gathering spot where the team for the night's operation, including Ilona and other advanced metahumans, had assembled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander!" Brittany's presence at the gathering was unexpected.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stay back at the base and wait for us. We'll return victorious."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smiled and patted Brittany's head. Without a word, she threw herself into his arms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The rest of the team watched the scene, their faces filled with envy toward Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ilona, too, looked at Brittany with a trace of envy. She had always admired strength, and Alexander was the strongest person she had ever encountered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The power Alexander had shown was already terrifying, and Ilona believed it was just the tip of the iceberg.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because of this, Ilona not only admired Alexander but also felt a growing affection for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander glanced at everyone, and the team immediately stood at attention, not daring to upset him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A few of the metahumans offered awkward smiles, clearly nervous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, there's something I need to tell you," Brittany said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Still hugging him, Brittany leaned in and whispered in Alexander's ear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What is it?" Alexander asked, puzzled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brittany said seriously, "Alexander, there might still be trouble from Gael's side!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh? What trouble? Didn't their leader, Ilona, already admit defeat? Could it be that she's still unwilling to let it go?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander hadn't expected the matter to remain unresolved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Gael has an older cousin named Jonah Jimenez, and he's said to be even stronger than Ilona.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Unlike Gael, Jonah is ruthless, extremely protective, and values his pride. I heard he was furious when he found out you humiliated Gael in public.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, you can bet Jonah will come looking for trouble."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brittany frowned, looking at Alexander with concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, with the mission about to start, any additional complications could spell disaster.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But after hearing her out, Alexander simply chuckled, brushing it off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Alexander's nonchalance, Brittany grew anxious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, you really need to be careful. Don't let something small trip you up."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smiled and patted Brittany on the back, reassuring her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry. I'm not someone who's easy to deal with."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you seriously not worried at all? Not even a little? Jonah is even stronger than Ilona!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brittany was speechless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There's no need to worry. No matter how strong he is, he's no match for me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander spoke with full confidence&mdash;not out of arrogance, but because he trusted his own abilities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brittany wanted to say more, but Alexander cut her off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Trust me, it'll be fine. If Jonah tries to provoke me, I'll make sure he regrets it for the rest of his life."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smiled calmly, showing no sign of feeling pressured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, I trust you," Brittany said, finally giving in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, the sharp sound of boots striking the floor echoed through the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A man in his forties appeared, staring coldly at Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In his hand, he carried a wide-bladed sword over three feet long. Its sharp, gleaming edge radiated an ominous killing intent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Jonah, what do you think you're doing? The mission is about to start. Are you </span><span>seriously trying to stir up infighting now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing the man clearly looking for trouble, Quentin questioned him sharply.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"General Thompson, my brother Gael was injured. I'm here to ask you to seek justice for him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jonah spoke with his head lowered, while a cold, sharp aura radiated from his body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I was there when it happened... and honestly, I think Gael brought it on himself. You can't blame anyone else, and I suggest you stop listening to baseless rumors that undermine our unity."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quentin warned him sternly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though Jonah was stronger than Ilona, Quentin wasn't going to allow him to stir up trouble at such a critical moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The mission was about to begin, and infighting would greatly harm their team's strength and morale.</span><span> </span></p><div class="pagination">
