  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quentin let out a heavy sigh. "You're right, Alexander. Things look calm on the surface, but there's a storm brewing underneath. Yinson's got most of the top brass eating out of his hand now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, I'll take the gold. I'll arrange for another shipment of weapons and ammo to be sent to Treasure Island </span><span>as soon as possible</span><span>. One more thing, I need a favor. Would you be willing to take Brittany with you to Treasure Island?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander hadn't expected this decision from Quentin. He'd figured the general would want to handle his granddaughter's protection himself, given all the power and resources at his command.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though surprised, Alexander didn't hesitate for a second. "You can count on me, Sir Thompson. I'll make sure Brittany stays safe. No one's going to lay a finger on her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Good man." Quentin beamed, giving Alexander's arm a hearty pat. "That's exactly what I wanted to hear."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thundering sound of helicopter blades filled the air as several choppers touched down at the base entrance, their rotors whipping up a small windstorm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander strode out of the cabin with military precision and headed straight for the base.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was just reaching his quarters, planning to grab his stuff before heading back to </span><span>Loscity</span><span>, when a voice called out, "Hey, Mr. Hathorne, hold up a second!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander turned to find Ilona stepping out from around the corner. He couldn't help but frown. Her waiting here couldn't be a coincidence. "What's wrong, Ilona?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I... I was hoping we could talk for a minute. If you've got the time?" Ilona's tone was serious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander studied her for a moment, trying to figure out her angle. Though she hadn't been back at the base long, she'd clearly gone all out with her appearance today.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her tight uniform hugged every curve, highlighting her hourglass figure in a way that would turn heads in any room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's this about?" Alexander asked, his voice flat and uninterested.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ilona rolled her eyes at him. Was this guy seriously that dense? While other men practically fell over themselves trying to get her attention, Alexander didn't even spare her an appreciative glance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She took a deep breath, reminding herself of Alexander's impressive capabilities. That thought alone made her pulse quicken with renewed determination.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Getting her composure back, she tried again. "Mr. Hathorne, I really admire your </span><span>skills. I was hoping we could discuss some questions I have&mdash;if you don't mind?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I promise I'm nothing like Gael," she added quickly. "If you're skeptical, maybe we could start with dinner? Just to get to know each other better."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Questions? Dinner?" Alexander resisted the urge to roll his eyes. He wasn't stupid&mdash;he knew Ilona was trying to hit on him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hathorne, I truly do admire you," Ilona insisted, her cheeks flushing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was the first time she'd ever made the first move with a guy, and her nervousness showed in the slight trembling of her hands. Her heart was racing like she was back in basic training.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander just gave a slight smile and said, "Ms. Cox, I need to get back to </span><span>Loscity</span><span>, so I'll skip the small talk. Maybe we'll run into each other again sometime."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he stepped into the room and started to close the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ilona tried to squeeze in after him, but Alexander flicked his wrist almost casually. A burst of Force energy pulsed out, sending her stumbling backward several feet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The door slammed shut with a solid thud.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ilona's face turned bright red with anger. "That arrogant bastard," she muttered under her breath. "Just because he's got some fancy powers, he thinks he's all that? Does he really think a door is </span><span>gonna</span><span> stop me? I could kick this thing down in a second."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite all her tough talk, Ilona didn't dare follow through with her threat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She knew better than to push Alexander too far. That would definitely end badly for her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, behind the door, Alexander couldn't help but let out a bitter chuckle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He already had too many women in his life and didn't need any more complications.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though he had to admit, Ilona was quite the catch&mdash;powerful, gorgeous, and had a killer figure to boot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Too bad that wasn't enough to change his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was well past midnight when Alexander and Brittany finally made it back to </span><span>Loscity</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After making sure Betty was settled in to look after Brittany, he headed home, planning to slip into his study without waking Ava or Lynn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Following a quick shower, Alexander settled in for some meditation to pass the time until dawn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wasn't sure how long he'd been sitting there when familiar footsteps approached his study, causing his eyes to snap open.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A gentle knock followed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Alexander opened the door, he found Lynn standing there with a steaming plate of spaghetti, a warm smile playing on her face.</span></p><div class="pagination">
