  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A towering figure with the confident stride of a predator entered the room. He wore sunglasses.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Behind him marched a formidable group, whose expressions were fierce.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was Joseph Whitaker, the notorious leader of the Cripples. What business did he have here?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Curiosity and concern painted the faces of the onlookers as they recognized Joseph.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The Cripples was one of the two major gangs, the arch-nemesis of the Blood Gang, which Billy was allied with.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With a contingent of security, Max moved to intercept them, creating a tense standoff.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Joseph flashed a dazzling smile, revealing his teeth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Ms. Blackburn, I'm sorry for crashing your soiree. I'm here for Billy. He took something of mine, and I've been on his trail for over a week."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava shot him an icy stare.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mr. Whitaker, the conflict between you and Mr. Marrow is of no concern to us. However, your presence has disrupted our dance, so we cannot allow that to continue. You are not welcome here. We kindly ask you to leave at once."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Joseph chuckled, the sound low and menacing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I hold great respect for the Saint Group, but that merchandise was worth fifty million dollars. I can't just walk away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Hand over Billy, and we'll be gone."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Billy, hidden among the guests, turned ashen. He hadn't anticipated the audacity of the Cripples to hunt him here, especially with Joseph at the helm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A light, almost musical laugh escaped Ava.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Billy is our guest tonight. His safety is our responsibility. How would it look if we couldn't protect our own?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Joseph's expression hardened.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Ms. Blackburn, are you refusing me? Many fear the shadow behind you, but we fear no one. I've got my own backing."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava furiously yelled, "How dare you disrespect Godfather?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The air crackled with tension as members of the Saint Group drew their pistols, aiming at the Cripples, who responded in kind, revealing not just pistols but an arsenal of submachine guns. Clearly, they were prepared for conflict.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Observing the drawn weapons, Joseph laughed heartily because his men were well-equipped and outnumbered the people of the Saint Group.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Ms. Blackburn, hand Billy over, or I'll rip the Saint Group apart until it rains blood.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Even if the old man seeks vengeance, he might not find me. Is Billy worth all this?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He believed he held the upper hand, so his pride was swelling.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander's heart pounded with determination. Capturing Joseph, the elusive leader, would send shivers of unease through the ranks of the Cripples.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But Ava quickly grabbed him and said, "Don't take risks. It's very dangerous."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Billy, now desperate, realized his fate was sealed. If he was captured by the Cripples, death would be a mercy for him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Over the years, he had managed to offend countless individuals, leaving a trail of resentment in his wake. In a reckless alliance with the notorious Blood Gang, he had orchestrated a daring heist against the Cripples, seizing a valuable shipment. Yet, amidst the chaos and thrill of the robbery, he found himself with a mere ten million dollars.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Billy strode into the Saint Tower with an air of confidence, convinced that no one would dare to challenge him in this domain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But he failed to anticipate the members of the Cripples, fueled by a reckless fury, stormed into the Saint Tower.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Joseph's eyes darted around until they locked onto Billy, who was trying to blend into the crowd.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Billy, why hide? Own up to your deeds. Come, let's talk."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Joseph lunged forward with the grace of a panther.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Billy, desperate to defend himself, reached for his gun, but Joseph's fist swooped in, crashing against his jaw with brutal force.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Billy screamed and collapsed on the floor with a resounding thud. Blood was spattering from his mouth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The crowd shrieked, recoiling from the violence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Max glanced at Ava for orders. "Ms. Blackburn, should we intervene?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava smirked, "Let Billy learn his lesson, but Joseph mustn't leave with him. We can't afford to lose face to the Cripples."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Struggling, Billy seized a wine bottle, hurling it at Joseph, who agilely dodged and shattered it with a precise punch.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Joseph's punch radiated with such precision and power, proving his boxing prowess, which rivaled that of the best professional fighters.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He toyed with Billy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">No matter how fiercely Billy fought back, his efforts were in vain. Joseph moved with the fluid grace of a dancer, effortlessly dodging every swing and countering with punches that left Billy's face marred with bruises.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You're nothing but trash. How dare you take from us?"</p><div class="pagination">
