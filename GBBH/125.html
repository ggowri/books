  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Jane, what should we do now? If Mr. Sebastian Tate won't help us, are we really going to have to beg Alexander?" Andrew was utterly at a loss.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane looked dazed. Not long ago, she had been full of ambition, convinced she was on the verge of becoming vice president of the Brilliant Group, ready to finally be a winner in life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet now, not only had she lost her shot at vice president, but her family was also on the brink of bankruptcy. It was like a nightmare to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Alexander had become the center of attention in </span><span>Loscity</span><span>. His reputation and influence were soaring, and he was quickly rising as the city's new elite.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane's feelings were in turmoil. On one hand, she despised Alexander and wished he'd disappear; on the other, she was filled with regret and self-blame.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought if only she hadn't forced Alexander to divorce her, she could have been a respected woman by his side.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, Alexander held the formula for the magic powder, and he had Ava by his side. If things went smoothly, the Hawthorne family would soon be one of </span><span>Loscity's</span><span> top families.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The more Jane thought about it, the angrier she became. Finally, she fainted on the spot...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inside the Saint Group headquarters, Ava was busy signing a mountain of paperwork.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Piled on her desk were dozens of state-level contracts and hundreds of city-level agreements awaiting her signature.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander sat on the sofa, watching the mesmerizing woman with a warm smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava was beautiful. Her silky hair gleamed under the light; her lashes were long and curled, and her straight nose gave her face a striking definition. Her big, luminous eyes had a way of making anyone's heart race at first glance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wore a simple business suit, yet her allure was undeniable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her figure was graceful, every curve flawless as if sculpted by an artist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Any man seeing such a mature, enchanting beauty would undoubtedly feel the urge to conquer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander watched Ava openly. Memories of their candlelit dinners together came to mind, and he couldn't help but feel that, if not for Ashley's incident, they would already be together by now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lost in thought, he didn't realize Ava was looking up at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's going on? The way you're staring at me is a little scary, like you're about to devour me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander chuckled. "That's right. I was just thinking about how to do exactly that!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava blushed, giving him a playful glare, and set down her pen, stretching her shoulders.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She walked lightly over to sit beside him, giving him a quick kiss on the cheek.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The coffee table was covered with snacks and fruit. Alexander peeled an orange and </span><span>fed her slice by slice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Watching her soft, red lips eat the orange. Alexander found the simple act oddly captivating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava sensed the shift in his mood and blushed even deeper.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey! What are you thinking? This is the office; you'd better behave yourself."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander pulled her close into his arms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, my neck. It hurts..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava winced, pressing a hand to her neck as her brows knitted in pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Concerned, Alexander used Force Sense to check on her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ava, you've got cervical spine issues, and today's long hours just triggered it," he explained.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She sighed. "Yeah, it's inevitable with this job."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander laughed. "That's a minor problem. I can fix it. As long as you take care of it afterward, it won't come back."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Really? That can't be true. The doctor said I'd just have to manage the pain; it couldn't be cured."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava had seen Alexander's abilities, but even now, she found it hard to believe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Here, let me give you a massage. I guarantee the pain will be gone in no time."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander rubbed his hands together, his expression taking on a mischievous glint.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're lying! I know what you're up to. You just want an excuse to take advantage of me! This is the office. What if someone sees us?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava </span><span>pouted,</span><span> her cheeks flushed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm your boyfriend. I won't hurt you Just sit back and let me help you out."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He guided her into a comfortable position, standing behind her and placing his hands on her shoulders, applying gentle but firm pressure as he massaged.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't get too handsy. If anyone sees, it'll be bad," Ava reminded him, half-protesting but still allowing the massage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Relax, I'm not in that much of a hurry. Besides, you're bound to be mine sooner or later."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander continued to massage Ava's neck, his hands gliding over her smooth, warm skin. Her soft, delicate skin felt incredible to touch.</span></p><div class="pagination">
