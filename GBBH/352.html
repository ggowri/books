  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Arthur's eyes grew fierce, and he snorted in displeasure, "In that case, you'll pay for it today!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was full of confidence. He had the advantage in numbers, and a dozen of his men were experienced and battle-hardened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander asked icily, "Who the hell do you think you are? How dare you ask me to pay for it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Arthur had never been looked down upon, especially in front of so many people. He was so furious that veins popped out on his forehead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He snorted, "You bastard, you're really arrogant. No wonder someone offered 100 million dollars on the Dark Web...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come on. Beat him up!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At a command from Arthur, the dozen or so burly men around him rushed towards Alexander like vicious wolves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander shook his head in disdain, picked up the steak knife, and launched a counterattack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He moved from side to side among the men, and every second, there were screams and the sound of people falling to the ground.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the blink of an eye, all the men were stabbed in the thigh or shoulder by Alexander, and the blood gushed out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They covered their wounds and wailed, like a group of wounded wolves, lying on the ground in all directions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Arthur was dumbfounded, never expecting Alexander to be so powerful. All his men were knocked down with one move, leaving him alone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander came in front of Arthur and sneered contemptuously, "Do you still want me to pay for it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't think you are invincible. I can't be easily defeated."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Arthur gritted his teeth and glared at Alexander, and suddenly, he kicked Alexander in the crotch, which was extremely insidious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How despicable!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander slapped him on the calf in annoyance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A crisp and terrifying sound was heard. Arthur instantly felt a sharp pain. His right leg was broken.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next moment, Alexander punched him in the stomach.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Arthur screamed in pain and collapsed to the ground, holding his stomach. He almost vomited bile and curled up like a shrimp.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was a dead silence. Everyone quietly watched Alexander teach the hooligans a lesson. Arthur, so arrogant just a moment ago, now lay limp on the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander glanced down at him coldly, "Did you just say that someone offered a reward for me on the Dark Web?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Arthur's face turned pale, and he stammered, "Don't you know about this matter? The reward of 100 million dollars has caused a sensation on the Dark Web. You will soon meet your doom."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander narrowed his eyes with murderous intent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Back then, the Brilliant Group posted a reward of five million dollars on the Dark Web, which enticed William to assassinate him, but he failed and was subdued by Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, someone was offering a reward of 100 million dollars for his death on the Dark Web. It must be Anthony's plot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Arthur sensed Alexander's terrifying aura and immediately trembled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"W-What do you want?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What do I want? I've promised them that I will not let you do evil here, so I want to destroy you to prevent future troubles completely."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's tone was frighteningly calm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How dare you! Are you aware that I'm a member of the Mafia? You'd better give up before it's too late. Otherwise... Ouch!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Arthur could finish his threatening words, Alexander stepped on his right hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With crips sounds, all the knuckles of Arthur's right hand were shattered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Faced with his miserable plea for mercy, Alexander remained indifferent and stepped on his left hand and then his left leg.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, Arthur, so aggressive just now, now became a cripple with comminuted fractures of his limbs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone was stunned. Alexander was incredibly powerful. He disabled Arthur in the street, and the Mafia would definitely take revenge on him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander glanced at Wesley and his men, causing them to beg for mercy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Remember, anyone who tries to collect protection money here again will be destroyed by me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I won't do it anymore. I won't do it anymore..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They picked Arthur up and fled in a panic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone cheered excitedly and applauded Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brittany asked, "Are you really going to let Arthur off? He is supported by the Mafia. They will go after you."</span></p><div class="pagination">
