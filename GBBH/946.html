  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander had made up his mind. There was no way he was going to let this grain fall into anyone else's hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yinson would eventually set off a crisis, and when that happened, money wouldn't be enough to get the grain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Cynthia stood up and declared loudly, "We're taking this batch of grain. Five billion and ten million!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I hope everyone will show some respect for the Ghost and not compete with us. If something goes wrong, don't say we didn't warn you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a blatant threat, and the guests at the auction immediately tensed up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was the legendary Ghost. They couldn't afford to cross them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The room went silent. No one dared to raise their paddle to bid against Cynthia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cynthia wore a smug, almost arrogant smile, as if she were above everyone else.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Five point one billion!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander raised his paddle, upping the bid.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cynthia's face darkened with fury. She was about to bid again, but a middle-aged man beside her stopped her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No need to rush. Since Alexander wants to go head-to-head with us, I'll take care of him later. He'll buy it, and then it'll all be ours."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cynthia sneered, her eyes burning with resentment as she glared at Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The middle-aged man's eyes were equally cold and dangerous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the end, Alexander managed to secure the grain for himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Next, the auctioneer introduced the second item, a production line from an international arms supplier, capable of producing bullets and grenades of various calibers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ladies and gentlemen, the starting price is one hundred million, with each bid going up by no less than one million."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"One hundred and ten million!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander made the first bid, his gaze challenging Cynthia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Strategic materials like this were essential to his plans. If he wanted to turn Treasure Island and Devil Island into doomsday bases, weapons and ammunition were a must.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cynthia wasn't interested in this outdated production line, but Alexander's challenge had her boiling with anger. Her eyes flashed with murderous intent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After several rounds of bidding, Alexander won the production line for one hundred and fifty million.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next items up for auction were valuable antiques, jewelry, and so on. Alexander wasn't interested in any of them and let them all go without a second thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The auctioneer's voice trembled as he announced the final item.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ladies and gentlemen, the last item is a set of documents related to the immortality serum of the Sakra Society. The starting price is five hundred million, with each bid increasing by no less than ten million."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A murmur spread through the room, and many faces lit up with greed and excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clearly, everyone was here for the immortality serum.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Such a thing could only be auctioned off on an extralegal island like Treasure Island. Anywhere else, and it would have been seized by authorities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cynthia stood up again, her voice dripping with arrogance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We came to Treasure Island for two things, and one of them is to buy these documents. Anyone who tries to bid against me is an enemy of the Ghost!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The room fell silent. Many people were already backing down, fear evident in their eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Others, however, were furious, glaring at Cynthia, unwilling to just let her take it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The immortality serum was an irresistible temptation for anyone, and those who had come to the island had some power themselves. They weren't going to give up without a fight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even the auctioneer had had enough.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He glared at Cynthia and sternly said, "Madam, you've repeatedly broken the rules of this auction. I'm asking you to leave!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cynthia was furious. She pointed at the auctioneer and spat, "You're nothing but a small-time nobody, and you dare to expel me? Jaxon, take care of him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, everything went haywire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A few barely visible black rays shot out from the middle-aged man's sleeves, faster than lightning, and struck the auctioneer in the face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The auctioneer screamed in pain, his hands clutching his face as he collapsed to the floor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Black poison needles were embedded in his face, which had already turned a dark shade. Blisters formed and rapidly rotted, as if his flesh was dissolving.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The room erupted into chaos as people scrambled to get away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop! How dare you make trouble on Treasure Island? Guards, seize them!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cloe was livid, slamming her hand down on the table.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dozens of guards rushed in, surrounding Cynthia and the middle-aged man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Think you can capture me? You're not even close."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The middle-aged man sneered, his movements a blur as he swung his arms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Countless black poison needles shot out from his sleeves, like a storm, aimed straight at Alexander and Cloe.</span></p><div class="pagination">
