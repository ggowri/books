  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jacob fell heavily to the ground, motionless, uncertain whether he was dead or alive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone was stunned. They never imagined that this decorated war hero couldn't even withstand one move from Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Pfft!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>William suddenly </span><span>spat</span><span> out a mouthful of blood; his body swayed a bit, but he managed to stay upright.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He clutched his abdomen and slowly retreated to Alexander's side.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander patted his shoulder, using the Force healing, and William's pale face regained some color.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as the two brushed past each other, Jacob did try to counter, but he was a step slower than William.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander said calmly, "You can't take such risks again. You tried to finish the fight quickly by going for a mutual injury. It's not a wise move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That guy was strong. If he hadn't underestimated you, you might not have won."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>William gave a helpless smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll work hard to get stronger. I won't embarrass you again, Boss."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smiled slightly. "I'm not blaming you. I'm concerned for you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they talked, Schroder and his people were like ducks caught by the neck, not daring to make a sound.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jacob was the most skilled among them, yet he was easily defeated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The atmosphere turned deathly silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Alexander strode toward Schroder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Schroder's face turned pale, and he stepped back several times.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What are you doing!?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He shouted at Alexander, unable to stop himself from retreating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>An overwhelming aura, like a mountain, pressed toward him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Especially Alexander's eyes, which seemed to hold a terrifying vortex that could swallow a person's soul.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So many people are watching. What exactly do you want?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With nowhere left to retreat, Schroder was now surrounded by a dozen of his men.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though he was surrounded by a wall of people, Schroder still felt Alexander's unrelenting focus, as if his life hung by a thread.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Forget a dozen men. Even an entire army wouldn't be enough to stop Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it, what kind of monster is this guy!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He cursed fiercely, his entire body soaked in cold sweat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander said expressionlessly, "Schroder, you pretended to represent the military to steal my formula. I won't let this slide. I'll report you to the military!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You dare! You actually dare go against me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Schroder shouted angrily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander chuckled. "If you don't want me to report you, apologize publicly, take your people, and leave </span><span>Loscity</span><span> forever."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as he finished, the crowd erupted in an uproar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was unbelievably bold now, daring to publicly threaten a lieutenant general.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava couldn't help but tremble, filled with pride at Alexander's unstoppable aura.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Schroder's face turned ashen with rage, veins bulging on his forehead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, do you know I have 50,000 elite troops? I could crush you easily!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander sneered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You might scare others, but not me. Without a military order, would you dare mobilize 50,000 troops to </span><span>Loscity</span><span>?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Schroder was rendered speechless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, Alexander! We'll see. You'll be the one begging me soon."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Schroder grabbed Jane's hand and dragged her away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wait!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander suddenly reached out to stop them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Jane, I promised Sir Fairfax I'd spare you, but staying with Schroder is a death sentence."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shut up!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane shouted loudly, cutting off Alexander's words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, we divorced a long time ago. Who are you to interfere? I want to be with the General, and you're just jealous!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Andrew rushed forward and shoved Alexander, shouting angrily, "Get out of the way! You conspired with a fraud to trick my family out of millions. We haven't even settled that yet, and now you're trying to break up Jane and the General. You're despicable."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander no longer tried to stop them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Since you're unrepentant, I have nothing more to say. Sooner or later, you'll face the consequences."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Schroder gave a sinister smile as he dragged Jane away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sure enough, the lingering ties between Alexander and Jane made her the perfect bait to trap him.</span></p><div class="pagination">
