  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Barry, Diego, and Felix returned to the hotel room, looking battered and worn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix was about to leave, but Barry stopped him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Felix, let's have a proper chat," Barry said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barry's tone was unusually warm and friendly, which Felix found odd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix wondered, what did Barry want to talk about?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Felix, always the sly fox, didn't show his surprise. He simply nodded politely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, I'll make some coffee, and we can talk over drinks."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After they entered, Barry plopped down on the couch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diego stood by with a grim look, saying nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix leisurely prepared the coffee.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Throughout the process, Barry and Diego didn't say a word, both staring intently at Felix.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The room was silent, the atmosphere tense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the smell of coffee filled the room, Felix poured cups for Barry and Diego, finally easing the tension on their faces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A faint, forced smile appeared on Barry's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Felix, thank you for all the funding. You're certainly a friend worth knowing," Barry said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix smirked internally but kept his expression calm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No need to thank me; it was just a small amount. Too bad the Red Umbrella Group is under fire. I can't free up much more. Otherwise, you'd still have a chance to turn </span><span>things around."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barry laughed. "Haha! Felix, don't worry. Regardless, you have my gratitude."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since leaving the gaming table, Barry, an infamous gambler, suddenly seemed rational again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Joyce isn't just my secretary and lover; we've been close since childhood. She's also tied to the Morris family's honor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm worried about her. This isn't over. I can't let Joyce spend the night with those two scumbags."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, Felix's face shifted slightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barry's words made it clear. He wanted Felix to find a way to bring Joyce back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was the Kaylon's territory, and any trouble here would surely bring an onslaught from them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix pretended not to understand, giving an awkward smile without saying much.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barry laughed. "Hahaha, Felix, don't worry. I'm not asking you to act. Diego and I will handle it. I trust you won't just stand by, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix gave Barry a pointed look.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is the Kaylon's territory. They're not the ones to mess with.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You both saw it just now. They have plenty of top fighters and likely some hidden trump cards too. I think going against them here, over one woman, isn't the smartest move."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barry waved dismissively, looking annoyed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Relax. Diego and I will handle it. But you need to drive us out of here. Once we have her, we're heading straight to </span><span>Kingsdon</span><span>."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diego gave Felix a cold stare.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If I'm not mistaken, you've gained powers and reached level-two metahuman, right?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>So</span><span> arranging a getaway car should be simple for you. Unless, of course, you don't want to help."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diego's eyes flashed with menace as he glared at Felix.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barry dropped his smile, watching Felix with a blank expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix stayed silent. He wasn't foolish. Barry and Diego's attempt to rescue Joyce would likely stir up the Kaylon, potentially risking lives.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Getting involved could spell disaster for him!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing his hesitation, Barry and Diego exchanged a look, realizing he was reluctant to help.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Narrowing his eyes, Barry asked, "Don't you want our help against Alexander?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix weighed his options carefully, finally nodding in agreement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fine. I'll be the getaway driver, but I'm not fighting."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Excellent!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barry slapped his thigh and pulled out a black sphere about the size of a thumb.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is our family's secret weapon. Inside is a swarm of killer bees we've spent countless resources to cultivate! Once the shell cracks, they'll kill whoever it hits.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry. The killer bees only attack once."</span></p><div class="pagination">
