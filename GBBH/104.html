  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No way!" Ava shot back instantly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Orion's smile vanished in an instant, replaced by fury.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Ms. Blackburn, although I may not be the sole heir of the Hansen family, I'm still quite powerful. Do you really think I can't compare to Alexander?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava scoffed, saying, "What do you take me for? A fickle-hearted flirt? Besides, in my eyes, you don't even come close to Alexander."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Orion's face turned a dark shade of anger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Rebecca, it seems your friend isn't interested in cooperating. Let's go."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But Rebecca caught his arm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Orion, what are you doing? Even if you like Ava, you can't forget the bigger picture. Whoever controls the magic powder controls the profits.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If you truly like Ava, you should compete with Alexander fairly. With your background and credentials, you would definitely outshine him."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She shot a glare at Alexander, clearl<span style="font-style: italic;">y </span>unimpressed with him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Emma quickly chimed in with a forced smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Ms. Blackburn just has a strong personality, Mr. Hansen. Please don't take offense; what matters now is our cooperation, as it concerns the future of the Saint Group and the Hansen family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"As for Ms. Blackburn's romantic matters, well, I still have high hopes for you!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She cast a look at Alexander, clearly believing he was nowhere near Orion's league.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Orion finally calmed down, a smile creeping back onto his face as he suddenly produced an elegant gift box.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Ms. Blackburn, I have a present for you&mdash;something you definitely won't refuse! But to receive this gift, you must agree to be my girlfriend."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava dismissed him with a disinterested huff, not even bothering to ask what was inside.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Seeing that Ava was ignoring him, Orion could no longer force a smile. He began to boast.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Inside this box is the contact information for Mr. Gellar, the developer of the magic powder. Don't you want to meet him before the conference?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What! The developer of the magic powder, Mr. Gellar?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava's eyes lit up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She thought, "If we could persuade Mr. Gellar, be the exclusive distributor of the magic powder, and team up with other families and groups, Sebastian would be left watching the Brilliant Group crumble."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander couldn't help but burst into laughter, clearly not believing that "Mr. Gellar" was a real deal.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Orion snapped, "I wasn't talking to you! Why are you laughing?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander laughed so hard his stomach hurt.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Who knows, that Mr. Gellar might be a fraud, and you could be the one getting scammed!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Orion, furious, pounded his chest in assurance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I've seen Mr. Gellar create the magic powder with my own eyes. How could that be fake? Alexander, you're just jealous I might take Ms. Blackburn from you.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Ms. Blackburn, as long as you agree to be my girlfriend, I'll immediately contact Mr. Gellar, and we can meet him beforehand."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander turned to Ava and said, "The developer of the magic powder is definitely not this Mr. Gellar."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava's heart raced.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She grabbed Alexander's hand tightly. "Really? You're not fooling me, are you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Gently brushing her cheek, Alexander replied, "Silly girl, when have I ever lied to you?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"In fact, I've already discussed the arrangement with the magic powder developer, and the Saint Group will be the exclusive distributor. I didn't mention it earlier to surprise you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His words dropped like a bomb, leaving everyone stunned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Rebecca was the first to doubt him, mockingly sneering, "Alexander, is it really amusing to conjure up such ridiculous lies just to undermine Orion?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Orion snapped back from his shock, also disdainfully rolling his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Alexander, you're just a fraud. Your character is abysmal! Ms. Blackburn, do you really believe this pathetic lie?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava ignored their antics and seriously asked Alexander, "Are you sure you're not lying to me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Of course not!" Alexander replied earnestly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Then, turning to Orion, he proposed, "How about we make a bet?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If the Saint Group doesn't become the exclusive distributor of the magic powder tomorrow, I'll concede and let go of Ava.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But if you lose, you can't pursue my girlfriend anymore."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Rebecca and Ava were close, and Alexander didn't want to completely alienate the Hansen family. This bet was the perfect way to put an end to Orion's relentless pursuit.</p><div class="pagination">
