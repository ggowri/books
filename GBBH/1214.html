  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was no doubt in Ilona's mind&mdash;Alexander's strength far exceeded hers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why... How is this possible? Level-four metahumans are already rare, and the best among us... And now this guy turns out to be one of them too?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ilona had already decided to admit defeat. Facing an opponent like Alexander, she stood no chance at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander observed everyone's expressions, then waved his hand toward the shooting range.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dozens of bullets stormed forward like a violent downpour, slamming into the thick concrete wall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The wall, over three feet thick, was riddled with dozens of holes, swaying unsteadily before collapsing with a thunderous crash under their stunned gazes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, the digital screen displayed a total score of 900 points!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the same amount of time, Alexander had scored more than twice as much as Ilona.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The room fell into dead silence&mdash;Ilona had lost miserably!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Defeated! But I can't believe it. Could he already possess level-six abilities?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gael's expression was utterly grim. The thought of having offended a metahuman three levels above him sent chills down his spine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone else distanced themselves from Gael's group, eager to draw a clear line.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's abilities could no longer be described as extraordinary&mdash;they were terrifying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Alexander wanted, he could easily kill everyone present without breaking a sweat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brittany and Quentin were both thrilled, unable to suppress their excitement. They hadn't expected Alexander to grow this powerful&mdash;it was simply unbelievable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I lost!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ilona admitted defeat decisively, lowering her head deeply. Her cheeks burned red, feeling as though she'd been completely stripped bare and exposed in front of everyone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, I knew you'd win!" Brittany cheered as she ran over and hugged Alexander tightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hahaha!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quentin laughed heartily, "Amazing! You truly stunned everyone with that performance."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm sorry. I apologize for my earlier recklessness and disrespect."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To everyone's surprise, Ilona put aside her pride and apologized, her tone now incredibly respectful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As someone who always admired strength, Ilona had accepted Alexander's power after losing and naturally bowed her proud head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was even a faint hint of admiration and respect in the way she looked at Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sigh..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gael let out a deep sigh, clearly shaken to his core.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had always thought of himself as a prodigy, but now even his leader, Ilona, had been humiliated by Alexander in front of everyone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is all your fault! Can't you go a single day without stirring up trouble?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ilona raised her hand and slapped Gael hard across the face, leaving him dazed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Cox... I'm sorry! It's all my fault!" Gael apologized miserably, holding his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After witnessing Alexander's display of power, Gael knew he had no courage to stand against him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's the point of apologizing to me? You'd better earn Mr. Hawthorne's forgiveness, or even I won't be able to save you&mdash;unless you have a death wish!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ilona's icy tone sent chills down his spine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gael's expression turned bitter. He realized Ilona was trying to save his life&mdash;if Alexander decided to act, no one could stop him, nor would anyone dare to try.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm sorry, Mr. Hawthorne. Please, for the sake of us being part of the same operations team, forgive me this time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I also promise never to bother Ms. Thompson again!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gael bowed deeply to </span><span>Alexander,</span><span> his demeanor utterly respectful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm not going to waste my time on someone like you. I just want you to understand&mdash;having powers doesn't make you better than anyone else. Everyone is equal!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You think ordinary people are like ants beneath your feet. Well, I see you the same way&mdash;just an ant I could crush with a single step.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I hope you'll reflect on this and behave better in the future!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying that, Alexander turned and walked away, taking Brittany and Quentin with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Cough!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gael was so furious he coughed up a mouthful of blood. Judging by his state, he wouldn't be participating in tonight's mission.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"For a woman... is it really worth it?" Ilona sighed deeply.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She sighed again, glancing enviously at Brittany's retreating figure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You two, along with Gael, will spend the next month in solitary confinement!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gael and his two companions were led away miserably, not daring to utter another word.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The other team members were deeply reflective. Many of them had shared Gael's mindset deep down.</span><span> </span></p><div class="pagination">
