  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Vampires? Those evil creatures still exist these days?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix could hardly believe his ears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rock's face lit up with manic excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm going to capture this vampire and make it my slave. Maybe I can even unlock the secret to immortality from studying it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Immortality? Mr. Rossetti, don't you think you're getting ahead of yourself?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The middle-aged warrior shook his head with contempt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rock shot him a deadly glare.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hana Salem, you better keep your mouth shut! Or you might not live to regret it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though Hana's eyes blazed with fury, he held his tongue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All surveillance cameras were now focused on the blood mist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Red Umbrella Group's men kept dropping like flies, and their bodies withered </span><span>husks drained of blood. Meanwhile, the crimson mist grew thicker and spread wider.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even from inside, Felix and the others could smell the overwhelming stench of blood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was stunned, too. He never expected William would give him such a shocking surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>William, accompanied by countless vampire bats, had become a killing machine, taking down more enemies than all of Shadow's men combined.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hidden in the blood mist, he moved like a dark god walking among mortals, cutting down everything in his path.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmph!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix scoffed, "Deploy the Elite Squads. Stop them at all costs until the magic circle is fully activated. Focus on catching whatever's hiding in that blood mist. Let's see if it's human or something else."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes gleamed with greed and ambition. If Rock were right about discovering the secret to immortality, they'd hit the jackpot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rock couldn't contain his urgency.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get the Elite Squads moving now! Thirty million dollars to anyone who uncovers the secret of the blood mist!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You've all received my blessing! You can withstand those vampire bats for a while! Success is guaranteed!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Several teams rushed out from the Red Umbrella Group headquarters.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One team was decked out in combat exoskeletons, manning heavy weapons.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The other two teams consisted of metahumans with Powers, expert fighters, and gray wizards.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Together, these three teams totaled over two hundred personnel. Their combat prowess was nothing to sneeze at.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each member bore a black fingerprint on their forehead, pulsing with dark energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This mark, left by Rock's mysterious sorcery, would shield them from the vampire bats' attacks and other negative energies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The first Elite Squad led the charge, their combat exoskeletons helping them move like human lightning across the terrain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their combat gear was top-notch, nearly matching the battle armor used by Shadow's forces, and they had a clear advantage in numbers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, William showed no signs of slowing down. His body count was pushing eighty, if not a hundred already.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A thick crimson mist enveloped the area several yards around William's position.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A dozen Red Umbrella Group operatives in exoskeletons rushed to surround the blood mist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Take him down!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The squad charged toward the blood mist as one unit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Black marks on their foreheads lit up with an eerie glow, pushing back both the blood mist and vampire bats before they could make contact.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, well. That's definitely Rock's witchcraft at work. Though it's only effective because I haven't reached my full power yet," William said with mild surprise, followed by a sneer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You forget I'm not just some noble vampire. I'm a metahuman with firearm power too!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the blink of an eye, an anti-materiel sniper rifle materialized in his hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>William's face twisted into a savage grin. If his opponents could see his expression through the blood mist, they'd be shaking in their boots.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Three shots rang out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>William's mastery over firearms was incredible. Though he fired three separate shots, they seemed to hit simultaneously, each armor-piercing round glowing bright red.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before the three elite soldiers could react, their chests exploded with gaping holes you could see straight through.</span></p><div class="pagination">
