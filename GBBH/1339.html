  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the Palace in Darwin, the Silvermoon Gate served as the main entry and exit point for the palace staff and guards, and it was bustling with activity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Servants and maids from various departments were coming and going, attending to their duties. Among them, a dashing young general clad in armor and a soldier in a white robe followed a purchasing servant toward the Silvermoon Gate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On Oak Avenue, the busiest street in Darwin, a "man" and a woman walked closely together, making their way through the throngs of people.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A beautiful maid, her silver hair pinned up and dressed in a flowing green gauze skirt, leaned on the arm of a striking young "man," whispering, "Your Highness... Oh, I mean, sir, you're truly remarkable. We always manage to slip out without anyone noticing."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The handsome young "man" in white waved his folding fan and replied, "Lana, don't just play around. I heard there's some amazing Risunese juggling going on up ahead. It should be fun."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not far off, Alexander, Logan, and Jalen strolled casually along Oak Avenue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jalen exclaimed, "I just remembered! Someone at the manor mentioned there's a Risunese juggling troupe performing nearby. It sounds really interesting. How about we check it out?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Logan replied excitedly, "Sure, let's go see it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander nodded in agreement. The trio asked for directions and headed straight toward the Risunese circus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the end of an alley on Oak Avenue, a large courtyard came into view. The area was filled with a lively crowd and the sound of continuous applause.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A banner at the entrance displayed bold letters proclaiming "Risun Circus." Nearby, a group of Risunese was selling tickets, charging one coin for three people.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's pretty expensive," Alexander grumbled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After purchasing their tickets, they entered the courtyard, which was about a hundred feet long and wide.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inside, there were men, women, the elderly, and children&mdash;probably thousands of people crowded together. Some were sitting or squatting in the front, while others stood in the back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the center of the courtyard was a large wooden stage, complete with a grand curtain behind it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A juggling act was currently in progress, featuring two Risunese performing a fire-blowing trick that sent bursts of flames shooting into the air, eliciting cheers and shouts from the audience.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jalen joined the crowd in cheering, while Alexander and Logan found it rather dull. After witnessing modern, high-tech juggling performances, the Risunese display felt a bit childish to them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They exchanged glances, sharing a mutual understanding of their boredom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Following the fire-blowing act, the next performances consisted of acts that were popular in that era, such as unicycling and stilt walking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just when Alexander and Logan were starting to doze off, a short Risunese emerged from behind the curtain. He sported a high bun, small eyes, and an unsightly big black mole on his right cheek, which had a few black hairs protruding from it. He was dressed in a white hunting robe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Risunese announced loudly in a strange accent, "Thank you all for your support! Up next is our most thrilling and magical show: the Disappearing Act!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd erupted in excitement, clapping enthusiastically&mdash;it seemed the show was quite a hit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Risunese pointed to a young man in white, saying, "Now, we invite the young man in white to join us on stage. Everyone, give him a warm welcome!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The young man in white appeared somewhat reluctant, but a few Risunese dancers coaxed him forward with sweet smiles, encouraging him to participate. After a moment of hesitation, he stepped onto the stage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Alexander took a closer look, he recognized him as the boy who had argued with Julius on the street that day.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He nudged Logan and said, "Hey! It's someone we know."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who?" Logan asked, following Alexander's gaze and seeing a handsome young man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A chill ran down Logan's spine as he touched his own backside. Fearfully, he looked at Alexander. "You don't actually like him, do you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander slapped him on the shoulder and shot back, "Get out of here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, several Risunese on stage rolled out a large cabinet and set it up in the spotlight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>An older Risunese appeared, acting mysteriously as he waved a stick-shaped prop, gesturing theatrically before instructing the young man in white to step inside the cabinet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once the cabinet door closed, the old man screamed hoarsely and pointed at the cabinet with his stick.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The cabinet door swung open, revealing a beautifully dressed Risun dancer stepping out, while the young man in white had vanished.</span></p><div class="pagination">
