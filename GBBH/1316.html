  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander rolled his eyes. "Logan, you're about to reach level-one warrior yourself. Tell me, how am I supposed to master the softness of a level-two warrior? How do I balance strength and flexibility?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Softness? How soft? Like yoga?" Logan grinned, spreading his stance and raising his hands as if preparing to do yoga.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Watching Logan clown around, Alexander couldn't help but smile. He knew Logan was trying to cheer him up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wait! Don't move!" Alexander suddenly shouted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Huh?" Logan froze on the spot, arms raised in front of his chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander clenched his teeth and spoke with excitement, "Harmonic Fist... Catch the Wind's Path!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He gave Logan a hearty slap on the back. "You've done me a great favor! Back at the manor tonight, you will have extra rations!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without wasting a second, Alexander adjusted his stance, steadied his breath, and channeled the Force. He sank his shoulders, relaxed his elbows, and bent his knees into position. Step by step, he moved through the motions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By the time Alexander finished the complete 24-posture of Harmonic Fist, he could feel an acceleration in the subtle flow of the Force within his core. A wave of indescribable ease washed over him as if he were floating on air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So this was it. A level-one warrior relied solely on brute strength, much like the martial arts he had known back on Earth. It was powerful but also unknowingly damaging to the body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Many wouldn't even notice the harm, but if they failed to advance to level two within ten years, their body would suffer irreversible damage, crushing any hope of ever reaching that stage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Level-two warriors blended strength with softness, using flexibility to counter raw power. By balancing force and flow, they not only restored their physical condition but also unlocked their full potential. With the Force vortex within them, they could move swiftly, leap nimbly, and take on dozens of opponents without breaking a sweat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Logan watched with great enthusiasm. "You've got to teach me this Harmonic Fist!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander said, "Of course! I'll teach you. But later, I'll show you something even more powerful."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Logan clasped his hands together, eyes sparkling like a starstruck fan. "Really? What is it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ancient Vardaanian yoga," Alexander said with a mischievous grin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Logan glanced down at his round belly. It was so round he could barely see his feet. He shouted, "Spare me!" Then, he bolted, running off to practice the Muscle-Tendon Classic instead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harmonic Fist emphasized fluidity, softness in movement, breath, and force. In terms of overall balance, it was undoubtedly top-tier, but Vardaanian yoga might have the upper hand when it came to sheer flexibility.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Back on Earth, Alexander had once joined a yoga class just for the sake of watching beautiful women. He hadn't practiced much, but he still remembered some poses. With the Force flowing inside him, he figured he might just be able to pull them off. "Cobra pose... Twisting pose... Splits... Shoulder stand..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, Alexander yelped, "Logan! Logan, get over here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What happened?" Logan rushed over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My back! I pulled something. Help me back inside!" Alexander groaned, looking utterly resentful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Back at the manor, Alexander flopped onto his bed with a sigh. "Guess I'll need at least two days of proper rest," he thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For the past month, Alexander had done nothing but train from morning till night, pushing himself to the limit. He'd snap like an overstretched bowstring if he didn't stop now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The martial arts manual had warned about this. Hard work was essential, but so was knowing when to rest. Strength that wasn't maintained would fade, and excess would lead to ruin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Alexander was about to close his eyes, loud knocking echoed outside. "Alexander! Open up!" Logan shouted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander got up and opened the door. Standing outside were Logan and two warrior priests. One tall and one short. The shorter priest held a square box, its emerald surface gleaming under the light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The tall priest smiled and said, "There's a grand ceremony at the church today. The priests used the Melon King to refresh themselves. These two pieces are your reward as the melon cultivators."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The shorter priest handed the box to Alexander, and then both priests bowed slightly before turning and heading back toward the church.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Onlookers watching the exchange were brimming with envy. Alexander grabbed Logan, pulled him inside, and shut the stone door behind them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He placed the box on the table and carefully lifted the lid. Instantly, a rich, intoxicating melon fragrance filled the air, making them feel light-headed from the aroma alone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inside, two palm-sized pieces of Melon King rested neatly in the box. The deep emerald skin was adorned with dark wave patterns, while the flesh was a striking red, dotted with black crystal-like seeds that shimmered faintly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander and Logan couldn't resist. They each picked up a piece and took a bite. The moment the juicy sweetness hit their tongues, they were stunned. The black crystal seeds melted instantly in their mouths, transforming into a warm current that flowed straight down to their cores.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, they could feel the Force within them expanding, growing more robust.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Within just a few bites, the melon was gone. Logan licked his lips, still craving more. "Alexander, you're in charge now. Let's go pick a few more melons to eat."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander shot him a glare. "Are you out of your mind? Have you forgotten what happened last time you tried to sneak a melon? The bells went off like crazy! The bells have been blessed by the priests. Any attempt to pick a melon outside the designated harvest time will trigger them without fail. If you want to go, you go. I'm not going."</span></p><div class="pagination">
