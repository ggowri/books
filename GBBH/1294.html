  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Silvia fought back her tears and instinctively glanced at the prescription written on a sticky note.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She read through the ingredients, then scoffed. "This is just a basic hemostatic formula. I thought it was something special."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not only was she the eldest daughter of the Hewitt family, but she was also the general manager of Hewitt Pharma. She had a master's degree in medicine and knew pharmacology well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That guy had the nerve to call this a Miracle Hemostatic and swear that it would heal me in half a day. What a fraud!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She pouted in frustration, growing even more convinced that Alexander was unreliable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wait... This formula looks strange. What if it's poisonous?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As her eyes scanned the last few ingredients, a hint of doubt crept into her mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The first few herbs were common, but the ones at the end were completely unexpected.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She hesitated, holding the prescription.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That guy is just some weirdo intern doctor. What if he's just making things up?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Still, curiosity got the better of her. She called someone to deliver the ingredients.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wanted to test if the prescription actually worked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it didn't, she swore she would hunt Alexander down at the hospital and make him pay.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, a dozen medicinal ingredients were delivered to the villa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Silvia ground them into powder in precise proportions and mixed them together. Her cheeks burned as she undressed, her hands trembling as she applied the medicine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sight of red stains made her recall the madness from before. Her heartbeat quickened, and shame mixed with anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as her fury peaked, a wave of cool relief spread from her lower abdomen. The pain vanished instantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is unbelievable..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She tried standing up and was shocked to find that she felt much better.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She waited a little longer and checked her wounds. It was completely healed. Not only had her skin recovered, but it was smooth and flawless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought, "It's only been... ten minutes?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How is this even possible?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She felt as if she were dreaming. Everything seemed too surreal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It actually worked!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She clutched the prescription, her heart pounding with excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She immediately understood its enormous value.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With this formula, she wouldn't need to marry Lonnie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That guy just gave me this secret formula for free?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A wave of complicated emotions washed over her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She knew this prescription was worth a fortune. If mass-produced, it could revive the Hewitt family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It could even elevate them from a second-tier family in Kylaville to the top ranks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Could that bastard really like me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Silvia gazed at her reflection in the mirror, biting her lip. Confusion filled her beautiful eyes. Her delicate skin was still marked with the traces of last night, the red imprints left by his rough hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She let out a soft sigh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought, "Too bad he's just an intern. Even if he becomes a full-fledged doctor, he would never be worthy of me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for this formula... if I auction it off, it'll go for no less than fifty million, maybe even over a hundred million.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But since we... had that kind of relationship, I can pay him a little less. Consider it compensation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That way, we'll be even."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She laid out her plan in her mind. She should have felt satisfied, but for some reason, her heart felt heavier than ever.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Maris was watching a video with excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The camera was positioned to capture the vase on Silvia's coffee table. She had not only drugged the wine but also planted a hidden camera.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the footage, Silvia clung to Alexander, kissing him eagerly. She was the one leading him on. They collapsed onto the couch together.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But just as things were heating up, Alexander's foot kicked out in excitement and sent the vase crashing to the floor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Water from the vase soaked the tiny camera, rendering it useless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it! What kind of luck is that?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maris's face darkened with anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But then, an idea struck her, and a smug smile spread across her lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This footage is more than enough to prove that Silvia cheated on Mr. Atkinson."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She gleefully opened WhatsApp and sent the video to Silvia along with a message.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[Silvia, you're not marrying Mr. Atkinson. He belongs to me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On your engagement day, I'll expose this video to everyone. You'll be ruined. You'll be the biggest slut in all of Kylaville.]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Silvia saw the message and felt a surge of panic and rage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She immediately replied. [Maris, you bitch! I won't let you get away with this!]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmph! Still acting tough? Then don't blame me for taking you down early."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Maris smirked, her eyes gleaming with malice.</span></p><div class="pagination">
