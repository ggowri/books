  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"When Ava gets back, I'm giving her a piece of my mind for dumping all this work on </span><span>you," Lynn scolded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander laughed it off. "Hey, we're family here - what's mine is yours. Don't make a big deal out of it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At his words, Lynn felt her cheeks heat up, recalling how Alexander had seen her rather revealing photos taken by Victor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those pictures were far too provocative, almost like something from an adult magazine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Indeed, they weren't strangers. He had seen her body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander noticed her silence, but her blush deepened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He raised his glass. "Here's to your beauty&mdash;may you find a wonderful husband!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lynn lifted her glass as well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Please don't talk about finding a husband; that thought frightens me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ha! A charlatan like Victor is rare. There are plenty of good men out there."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander laughed and downed his drink.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lynn took a large sip, surprised. "This wine is delightful! Better than any fancy wine I've had before."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's expression shifted. He recognized the distinct taste of magic powder mixed with the wine, realizing Ava had spiked it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The combination was potent and likely to amplify desires.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a clever ploy, and Alexander found it both amusing and bewildering.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But since Ava was so determined, it eased some of his own mental burdens.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Here's to you, Alexander! I wish you and Ava a happy future!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lynn toasted, clinking her glass against his.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The steak is cooked perfectly&mdash;tender and juicy. You should try some," Alexander said, cutting a piece and bringing it to her lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before she could think, Lynn instinctively opened her mouth to take the bite, her heart racing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Mmm</span><span>, delicious! You really are quite the chef," she exclaimed, surprised by the flavor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At first, she felt a bit uneasy, especially under the intensity of Alexander's gaze, which held a hint of desire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It reminded her of how many men looked at her, and though Alexander remained a gentleman, Lynn could feel her own restlessness growing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he weren't to become her daughter's boyfriend, she would definitely not have resisted his advances.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But with a few drinks in her system, she found herself warming up to him more, the attraction becoming undeniable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then Alexander produced an exquisite gift box.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is Ava's birthday gift for you. She wanted me to present it personally."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A gift? What could it be? The box is so beautiful!" Lynn exclaimed, eager to open it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before she could lift the lid, Alexander stopped her, a mysterious smile on his face. "Ava said you should open it in your room first and decide if you want to show me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What do you mean? It's just a birthday gift. Why so secretive? Don't worry, I will take a look and definitely show you afterward."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lynn reassured him as she headed to her room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Having had a few drinks, the magic powder was beginning to take effect, and she swayed slightly as she walked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander couldn't help but admire the way she moved, swallowing hard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once inside her room, Lynn tossed the box onto the bed and collapsed, feeling flushed and breathless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was a fire within her that needed release, and she couldn't quite understand it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a moment, she sat up and rubbed her temples, curious about the gift inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Opening the box, she found a sexy white dress&mdash;off-the-shoulder, plunging neckline, and extremely short.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once on, it left little to the imagination, exposing most of her figure and hinting at what lay beneath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lynn blushed, muttering to herself, "What was she thinking? This is far too revealing! I can't wear this out."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, she had to admit the outfit was undeniably alluring, bound to captivate any man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thought of Alexander flickered in her mind, and before she knew it, she had changed into the dress and stood before the full-length mirror.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the reflection was a captivating, voluptuous woman, her breasts and curves accentuated perfectly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she didn't wear a bra, her nipples were looming over the thin fabric.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The fabric hugged her form, leaving her feeling both empowered and exposed.</span></p><div class="pagination">
