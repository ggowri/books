  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was clear Nate had no idea that Ava was now the CEO of the Saint Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ever since the Saint Group became the exclusive distributor of the magic powder, the company's valuation had shot up, surpassing 150 billion dollars, and it was still climbing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As CEO, Ava's salary and dividends put her annual income in the hundreds of millions of dollars. Why on earth would she care about Nate's little offer?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Plus, Ava was proud and ambitious. Nate trying to buy her with money wasn't just insulting&mdash;it was downright degrading.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ugh!" Ava spat in disgust.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A million dollars? Please, that's pocket change. You're like a moth thinking it could date a flame."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nate's expression twisted </span><span>further,</span><span> his frustration evident.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander decided to step in. "Alright, fine. Let's settle this. I'll play along so you get it once and for all."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Good! I'll let you go first, so later you can't say I didn't give you a chance."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nate's confidence was sky-high.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sure, I'll go first," Alexander grinned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He started adding twenty-kilogram plates onto the barbell&mdash;five on each side. Including the original plates, it totaled four hundred kilograms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nate snorted in disbelief. "Seriously? You're trying to show off? Forget four hundred&mdash;can you even lift a hundred kilograms?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What a joke. Not even Olympic champions had lifted three hundred kilograms before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava stared at the </span><span>barbell,</span><span> her eyes wide&mdash;four hundred kilograms?!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though she believed in Alexander, that kind of weight was hard to imagine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander flashed Nate a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Watch closely. If I win, you disappear from our lives&mdash;forever."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next second, he grabbed the barbell with one hand, smoothly lifting it above his head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He did it effortlessly, not breaking a sweat or even breathing hard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How about that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander stood there, one-handedly holding up the four-hundred-kilogram barbell, still able to talk with ease.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nate stood frozen, jaw hanging open, wondering if he was dreaming.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The current world record for weightlifting was around two hundred seventy or eighty kilograms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Alexander effortlessly lifted four hundred kilograms with just one hand&mdash;a truly staggering display of strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he were to use both hands, he could likely lift eight hundred kilograms, leaving the current world record in the dust.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is that enough for you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander set the barbell down without effort as if it weighed nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nate couldn't help but stammer, "Are... are you even human?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander shot him a cold glare.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Less talking. I'm done. Your turn."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nate's face went pale, his eyes darting around as he avoided Alexander's stare.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He never thought he'd be humiliated in what he thought was his specialty and in such a decisive way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Nate, what do you think of my boyfriend's strength? You'll never be on his level, so do us both a favor and stay away from me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava's voice was full of disdain, her gaze cutting into Nate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nate's face flushed red, his eyes filled with frustration, but he couldn't argue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Forget one-handed four hundred kilograms&mdash;he could barely lift two hundred with both hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fine, you win."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nate shot Alexander a hateful look, then turned and stormed off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Watching Nate leave, Alexander chuckled softly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What could Nate do? Everything came down to raw power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I just helped you get rid of a pretty big annoyance. Don't I deserve a thank you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander teased, a playful grin on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ugh, you're such a pain! I'm all sweaty&mdash;let's go shower first."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava pouted, pressing her full figure against Alexander's chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her chest bounced slightly as if eager to break free from the tight yoga outfit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Desire flared within Alexander, and his All-seeing Eyes allowed him to see through Ava's clothes, taking in every inch of her smooth, soft skin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava could feel the heat of Alexander's gaze, her body shivering, legs almost giving out beneath her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without a second thought, Alexander scooped Ava up and carried her toward their suite.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Along the way, they drew plenty of stares.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Especially Ava&mdash;her stunning figure, full chest, slim waist, rounded hips, and long, toned legs had more than a few men staring in awe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment they entered the room, Alexander locked the door and hung the "Do Not Disturb" sign.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava casually slipped out of her yoga clothes.</span></p><div class="pagination">
