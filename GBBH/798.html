  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Betty stared at the surveillance screen and reminded Alexander, "Mr. Hawthorne, they are getting closer!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander sneered, "It doesn't matter. None of them can escape."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He kissed Betty on the face and then walked out leisurely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In another direction, Logan was grinning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"These Risunese bastards come at the perfect time. I haven't killed anyone in a long time. This time, I'm going to kill them wantonly!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Logan's eyes were fierce, and his expression was excited.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The position he chose formed a cross-fire point with Marvin. This way, they could completely cover a large area at the entrance of the base.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this time, Lamont reported to Alexander on the intercom, "All the guards at the base, fifty in total, are in place!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Okay, we can't let anyone leave later."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With that, Alexander came to the gate and stood in the middle of the small square at the entrance of the base.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When the Dragon Gang members pried open the door and filed in, they were all shocked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The captain, Diken Zander, looked surprised and incredulous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He had met Alexander during the day. He actually saw Alexander standing there and smiling at him now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diken thought, "How could Alexander know we are coming? What does he want to do?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The members of the Dragon Gang all knew something was wrong, and they looked very grim.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But they were not stupid and quickly surrounded Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They thought if they could take Alexander as a hostage, they would walk out unscathed and could even extort a large ransom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander smiled, "Do you want to catch me? Let me see whether you have the ability to do so."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diken roared and pointed his M16 Assault Rifle at Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>More than twenty of his subordinates also raised their guns and aimed at Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diken thought, "The members of the Dragon Gang kill people without hesitation. With more than twenty guns, Alexander can't fly away."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They all were full of confidence and thought that even if there was any conspiracy, they could break it as long as they caught Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Just then, a sound of tearing air rang out, breaking the silence of the night.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A beam of red light shot out and pierced through the chest of a member of the Dragon Gang.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The sharp arrow with fire power shot through him without any hindrance and then pierced deeply into the hard ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Under the considerable inertia of the sharp arrow, the corpse fell out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before anyone else could come to their senses, two more sounds were heard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Bullets blew up the heads of two members of the Dragon Gang. Blood, flesh, and brain matter splattered everywhere, and their bodies fell heavily to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After three of his subordinates died, Diken finally came to his senses and screamed in horror, "Be careful. There's a sniper!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Everyone, take cover! Everyone, take cover! We're ambushed... Ouch!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before Diken finished shouting, he felt a sharp pain in his chest. He looked down and saw that his heart was gone, and there was a big hole running through his chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Suddenly, the remaining people panicked. They turned around and ran away in despair, fleeing madly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>No one even wanted to shoot Alexander, as everyone was afraid that the sniper would target them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"How dare you want to run away now?" Alexander laughed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Two consecutive gunshots were heard, and two more bodies fell.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Kill them!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marvin put down his crossbow and rushed out directly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His burly body was like that of a black bear, and his roar was deafening.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He had awakened fire power and strength power. His fists were wrapped in scorching flames, and he could knock his enemies away with just one punch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The base guards also rushed out and surrounded the members of the Dragon Gang.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As a result, the members of the Dragon Gang begged for mercy before they could even fire a single shot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This kind of rubbish actually wants to launch a sneak attack. It's really courting death!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Logan laughed wildly and kicked his enemy away with just one kick.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After a few guys who wanted to resist were killed, the others all surrendered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, more than a dozen corpses were lying on the ground, and blood was flowing like a stream.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander smiled. These trashes were not worthy of his attack. It was enough for his subordinates to step in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Bring him here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander pointed at a guy who was trembling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marvin grabbed his neck and carried him to Alexander like garbage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander looked at him coldly and asked, "How many people are there in the Dragon Gang in Loscity?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The man looked up at Alexander, his eyes full of fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He had never expected that the outcome of this sneak attack would be so tragic.</span></p><div class="pagination">
