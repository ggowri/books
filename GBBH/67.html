  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Betty struggled desperately, her eyes brimming with tears.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Joseph, his expression lecherous and grin nauseating, leered at her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Ms. Rowe, you've been discarded by the Brilliant Group. Now, only I can protect you. It'd be wise to play nice, or you might regret it," Joseph taunted, his gaze and hand roving greedily over her form.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The ropes that bound her accentuated her curves, her skin standing out starkly against the harsh ropes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her terrified face only served to stoke Joseph's desire further.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The only thing that annoyed him was his injured right hand, which meant he could only use one hand to relish his pleasure. The thought of Alexander made him seethe with frustration.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When Joseph removed the gag from Betty's mouth, she immediately began to shout, "Get away from me, you bastard!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Joseph sneered, saying, "Oh, stop pretending. It's not like you've never been with a man before. Just do as you're told."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His expression twisted with increasing depravity.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He deliberately ran his hands over Betty's body, savoring her struggles and helplessness with a sick satisfaction.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In her despair, Betty blurted out, "If you lay a finger on me, Alexander will make you pay!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Alexander?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Joseph's eyes widened in shock before a vicious grin spread across his face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"So, you're a traitor, huh? Have you been in his bed? That guy sure has all the luck."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The mention of Alexander ignited a fiery rage in Joseph, burning with the same intensity as his lust.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He grabbed Betty with one hand and shoved her to the ground. Her voluptuous figure was laid bare.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As the sound of tearing fabric filled the air, her body was completely exposed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Joseph's eyes widened in hungry lust as he took in the sight.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Ms. Rowe, you're quite the piece of work, wearing such sexy lingerie. I'm loving it," Joseph growled, his face inches from her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He inhaled deeply, intoxicated by her scent mixed with a hint of sweat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Joseph was nearly beside himself with desire.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Betty writhed and screamed in terror, trying to escape.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Scream louder, sweetheart! The louder, the better!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Joseph, thrilled by her distress, smacked her rounded rear with a resounding slap, causing her hips to jiggle enticingly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Unable to control himself any longer, he hastily discarded his pants and, like a wild animal, mounted her from behind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A cold, harsh voice cut through the air.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You're a dead man!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Joseph, thinking it was one of his men, spun around, enraged. "Damn it, who let you in here?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But before he could react, he saw Alexander, and his face went pale with fear.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander rushed forward, kicking Joseph with brutal force.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">There was a deafening crash as Joseph's heavy body smashed through the door and hit the ground hard.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Amid his groans of agony and the blood spitting from his mouth, Joseph rolled on the floor, his bones shattered by the sheer power of Alexander's blow.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His fate was sealed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander quickly untied Betty and wrapped her shivering, naked form in a blanket.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Still disoriented, she only fully woke when she felt Alexander's comforting embrace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Seeing his familiar face, she burst into tears.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It's okay, it's all right. You're mine, and I'll make sure nothing happens to you," Alexander reassured her, gently patting her smooth, trembling body.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although Betty was just his subordinate, their bond had deepened after their previous sex. The connection between them was now more than just professional.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Boss, I'm so glad you're here..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Betty clung to Alexander like a ship finding a safe harbor in a storm. She buried her face in his chest, trembling.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander smiled gently and said, "Let's get you somewhere safe to stay."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He lifted her carefully.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His hand inadvertently brushed against her chest, causing Betty to shiver with a jolt, only to cling to him tighter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander couldn't help but recall their previous wild sex, and he felt a stirring reaction in his pants.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Clearing his throat to mask his embarrassment, he held Betty securely and strode downstairs.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">On their way out, Alexander turned on the gas valve. The pungent smell of gas began to fill the room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Moments after they left, the small building erupted in a massive explosion, a brilliant fireball shooting up into the sky.</p><div class="pagination">
