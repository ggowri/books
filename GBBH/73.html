  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Billy stumbled back, caught completely off guard.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Theodore glared at him with disdain. "You worthless piece of trash, a washed-up punk trying to pull stunts in front of me? I could have you shot in an instant."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Billy clutched his face, a mix of anger and humiliation washing over him. He knew better than to retaliate against Theodore.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Suddenly, Jane jumped into the fray, reveling in the chaos.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Billy, weren't you the one who helped Alexander scare me before? Thought you were pretty tough, huh? Look at you now, getting schooled by Mr. Tate!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She pointed an accusing finger at Alexander. "Mr. Tate, you should know Billy and Alexander are in cahoots. It's definitely Alexander pulling the strings!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Theodore pulled out his gun, aiming it squarely at Billy. "I don't care who's behind this. Hand over the 'magic powder' formula, and I might just let you live."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Billy's face turned pale. He had no formula to give, only desperate eyes turned toward Alexander, pleading for help.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'll count to ten. If you don't spill, I'll blow your head off," Theodore growled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Before Alexander could respond, a commanding voice cut through the tension.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Stop right there!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was David stepping forward.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Theodore, what the hell are you doing? Are you planning to commit murder in front of everyone? Loscity isn't a lawless wasteland!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mary chimed in, her expression serious. "Mr. Tate, if you kill Billy, you'll lose access to the magic powder, and the Blood Gang will unleash their wrath on the Brilliant Group!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Houtte glared at Theodore, his voice icy. "Mr. Tate, this is Loscity, not Sandgo or Mesco. If you pull that trigger, I guarantee you won't make it out alive."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Put the gun down! This is Loscity!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You can't touch Mr. Marrow; without him, who's going to get us the magic powder?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The crowd of guests erupted into chaos, voices rising as panic spread through the room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Faced with the collective anger, Theodore realized he was in over his head.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">No matter how powerful the Brilliant Group was, they couldn't take on all these forces at once, especially not in Loscity, where he was a stranger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Billy suddenly found his courage, bursting into laughter. "Ha! Theodore, don't think the Brilliant Group is all that. I'm Billy, and..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Before he could finish his taunt, Theodore gritted his teeth and squeezed the trigger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He thought, "Killing this punk will disrupt the magic powder supply and secure the Brilliant Group's profits."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The gunshot echoed, and Billy's heart raced.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He was no more than six feet away from Theodore&mdash;this was it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Theodore, don't you dare!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In a flash, someone yanked Billy out of harm's way.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The bullet whizzed past his cheek, grazing the skin and drawing a thin line of blood.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At the same moment, Theodore screamed, clutching his hand. Alexander had somehow knocked the gun from his grasp.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Gasps filled the room; no one expected Alexander to react so swiftly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The tattooed man rushed to shield Theodore, fury etched on his face. "You're asking for it!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander met his glare with cool indifference. "Just a dog barking at me. What makes you think I'd care?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The tattooed guy was ready to strike back when Theodore suddenly pulled him back, a sinister grin spreading across his face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Alexander, did you know your ex-wife Jane has been cheating on you? For two whole years, she's been putting you in the doghouse. Got anything to say about that?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I've slept with her more times than I can count these past few days. Pretty wild, huh? What's your take on it?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander's face remained expressionless. "Jane is just my ex-wife. Who she sleeps with is none of my concern."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Theodore yanked a blushing Jane forward, grinning wickedly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Why don't you tell everyone, Jane? Is Alexander impotent?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jane, betraying her conscience, nodded. "Yeah, he's definitely impotent, so I can't really blame myself."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Laughter erupted around the room, and many guests shot mocking glances at Alexander.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Unfazed, he kept his expression cold, showing no sign that he felt the need to defend himself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Theodore sneered as he continued to hurl insults at Alexander. "Isn't your daughter actually Alexander's child? Given his impotence, it must be with another man."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jane felt her dignity slipping away, but under Theodore's relentless pressure, she continued to lie through her teeth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes, that's right. She's not Alexander's child. He..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Enough!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The moment Theodore dragged his daughter into the mud, Alexander's rage boiled over.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Jane, it's one thing for you to slander me, but if you drag Ashley into this, I swear I won't let it go."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The cold fury that erupted from him made Jane tremble uncontrollably.</p><div class="pagination">
