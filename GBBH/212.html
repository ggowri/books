  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey, are you trying to scare me? On this street, everyone knows me. Do you think Xavier can help you? Sooner or later, my dad will take over their jewelry store!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angelica shouted arrogantly, weighing the gem in her hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll count to three. Give me the stone back."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's voice was cold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angelica shouted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This street belongs to our family. If you dare to hurt me here, my father will kill you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Three!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Two!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"One!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander finished counting, waved his hand and grabbed the gem first.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angelica felt a huge force rushing towards her, and she fell heavily to the ground with a cry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You dare to push me? How dare you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angelica was so angry that she was shaking all over. She pointed at Alexander and shouted, "Kill him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two bodyguards immediately rushed towards Alexander fiercely and hit him hard with their fists.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Piss off!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Alexander shouted, the two bodyguards were slapped in the face and fell to the side with screams.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angelica was frightened and yelled at Xavier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You are from the Ulysses family. How could you watch him beat us? Have you given up the dignity and honor of our family?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Xavier sneered, "You asked for it and deserve it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angelica said, "Xavier, you colluded with outsiders to attack the Ulysses family. I will ask my father to expel you and your mother from the family!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angelica kept yelling and shouting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's expression became increasingly grim.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said, "You are so arrogant at such a young age. You have no manners."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She said, "What? Go to hell!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angelica rushed towards Alexander like an angry tigress.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander kicked her in the stomach. Angelica flew up and fell heavily to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She held her stomach, unable to get up due to the pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander had showed mercy, otherwise he would kill her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Angelica did not regret it and scolded Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You bastard, you dare to hit me. Just wait and see. My dad will kill you!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Xavier, you are a traitor. You are a member of the Ulysses family. How dare you collude with outsiders to hit me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was speechless. If Angelica wasn't a woman, he would kill her to vent his anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angelica knew that she couldn't beat Alexander, so she could only leave, cursing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander ignored her. It was just a waste of his time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Xavier apologized awkwardly, "Alexander, Angelica is just like this. In fact, there are still many good people in our family..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander waved his hand. "It has nothing to do with you. But your family's head, Aiden, is probably not a good person either."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Xavier smiled </span><span>bitterly .</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aiden is indeed not a good person. He has always wanted to take over my shop by relying on his status. And if Angelica hadn't been spoiled by him, she wouldn't be so arrogant and overbearing."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander nodded and said nothing more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Xavier enthusiastically took Alexander to the store to buy gems.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this time, Angelica had already made a big fuss at home.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although the Ulysses family was not one of the top wealthy families in </span><span>Loscity</span><span>, they were unique in the gem business and had several mines in </span><span>Soutaxia</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, the Ulysses family was a long-term partner of the Kaylon. Relying on the Kaylon, the Ulysses family was also considered a powerful force in </span><span>Loscity</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dad, he beat me. Please teach him a lesson. Otherwise, it would embarrass the Ulysses family."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angelica stamped her feet with resentment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aiden frowned and asked, "I heard that you stole other people's things?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew what kind of person his daughter was. She must have been at fault first, but he was also very angry when he saw her being beaten.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the Ulysses family and the Carter family were now fighting for control of Gemstone Street. Aiden heard that the Carter family had invited a powerful man to help.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aiden was worried about this matter, so he was not in the mood to care about other things.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If the Ulysses family lost control of Gemstone Street, their reputation and income would plummet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That would be a catastrophe for the Ulysses family.</span></p><div class="pagination">
