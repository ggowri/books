Ava's face flushed with anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander rarely looked for trouble, but he wasn't about to back down now, especially with Nate Sullivan acting like this. The guy was downright disrespectful, flirting with Ava right in front of him. It made Alexander's blood boil.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You really won't move, huh?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's voice was icy cold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, you think you're so tough..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nate's expression was filled with arrogance as if he had nothing to fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before he could finish, Alexander slapped him across the face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Smack!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crisp sound echoed, and Nate spun around before falling flat on the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Holding his stinging cheek, Nate didn't even have time to cry out before Alexander kicked him square in the gut.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ahh!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nate Sullivan screamed as he was sent flying, landing on the ground and writhing like a fish out of water.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander shook his head with a sneer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't waste your time on this idiot. Let's go. This fool already ruined my mood."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Good hit!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava giggled, giving Alexander a thumbs-up before wrapping herself around his arm, and the two walked into the expo center.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The auction was being held in the conference hall, big enough to hold a thousand people, with several private rooms upstairs for VIPs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anyone in a VIP room was definitely someone important in </span><span>Tijuanea</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Our seats are over here," Ava said, guiding Alexander to their seats. They chatted while waiting for the auction to start.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Alexander sat down, Timothy and Arthur appeared out of nowhere, standing beside him with overly respectful smiles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Timothy, grinning obsequiously, said, "Boss, I sent over all the info on Victor Hughe. Are you satisfied?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander shot them a glance. "After the auction, bring Victor to me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, sir! I'll have my men grab him right now," Timothy said eagerly, already dialing his phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander waved dismissively, like he was shooing away flies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, we won't disturb you, Boss. We'll just wait over there," Timothy said quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, we won't get in your way," Arthur echoed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both of them stepped back and stood there still.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's tone was flat. "Just stay out of my sight. You're ruining my mood."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Timothy and Arthur's faces went pale with anger. No one had ever dared talk to them like this, but what choice did they have?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had to swallow their pride, keeping awkward smiles plastered on their faces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava was surprised to see these mob guys acting so submissively around Alexander, but after all she'd witnessed, nothing about him shocked her anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey, Alexander! I finally found you!" a shout suddenly came from across the room, and there was Nate, pointing and yelling at Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Timothy, this clown keeps bugging me. Take care of it. I don't want any more interruptions," Alexander said, gesturing lazily at Nate Sullivan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who the hell does he think he is, bothering our boss?!" Timothy's face twisted with rage, ready to prove his loyalty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Arthur shot Nate a death glare. "You really want to die today, huh?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was already in a foul mood from being bossed around by Alexander, and Nate was the perfect outlet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get him out of here! Teach him a lesson!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Timothy barked, waving his hand. A few of his men rushed over, landing punches on Nate's gut, leaving him howling in pain as they dragged him away like a sack of trash.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander simply smiled, dismissing Nate as the insignificant nuisance he was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He and Ava continued chatting happily, ignoring the chaos. People kept streaming into the hall until every seat was filled&mdash;over a thousand attendees.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This auction was a major event featuring rare gems and exclusive jewelry pieces crafted by renowned designers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ladies and gentlemen, esteemed guests, welcome! I'm Leo Jenkins, your host and auctioneer for today," the host's voice boomed enthusiastically as he delivered his opening speech, eventually announcing the official start of the auction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd erupted in applause, and the excitement in the air was palpable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you for your warm welcome! Let's get started&mdash;bring out the first item!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leo's commanding voice echoed as a model walked onto the stage holding a tray.</span></p><div class="pagination">
