  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was confident he could infiltrate Guzman's hideout, no matter how secure it was. In an instant, he appeared on the balcony, balancing on the railing against the fierce sea breeze. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The wind was strong, but he stood firm, as if rooted to the spot. It was night, and the island's lights flickered against the dark ocean, creating an eerie beauty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, there was a knock at the door. Alexander's eyes narrowed. Who could be visiting him at this hour? Were his observers making a move? Peering through the peephole, he was surprised to see Alice. What was she doing here?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alice was dressed provocatively in an off-the-shoulder top and denim shorts that left little to the imagination. Alexander opened the door quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alice slipped inside, smiling playfully. "Are you in need of special services tonight, sir?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alice, why are you here? I told you to stay on the yacht," Alexander said, his voice firm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Can't I have a little freedom? You're my boss, but I was worried about you... Don't worry, I came disguised as an escort. No one will suspect a thing," she replied, a hint of blush on her cheeks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was speechless, impressed by her ingenuity. Alice locked the door and leaned against it, looking at him with longing eyes that were hard to ignore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne, it's so hot. Mind if I use your shower?" she asked, heading to the bathroom without waiting for his response.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander shrugged helplessly. It seemed his secretary had no intention of leaving him alone tonight. The room was well-appointed, featuring a large round bed that seemed suited for more than just sleeping.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sitting on the bed, Alexander couldn't help but think back to his recent troubles with unemployment and Ryan's betrayal. In a short time, he had turned his life around and was now pursued by beautiful women. It felt surreal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He pinched himself, wincing at the pain. This was no dream, but the threats lurking in the shadows were real.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Time slipped by, and soon the bathroom door opened. Alice emerged, wrapped in a towel, her hips swaying. The towel barely covered her chest and reached only her thighs, revealing her long legs. She was alluring.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Alexander's gaze, she smiled and sat by the bed. "What are you thinking about, Mr. Hawthorne?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just reminiscing," Alexander replied, his eyes on Alice. She was captivating, displaying her figure in a way that was hard to resist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Did you come here just to take a bath, Ms. Hollister?" he teased.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alice giggled, her laughter drawing his attention again. Alexander wasn't indifferent to her charms. She was his secretary and confidante, someone he trusted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What concerned him was the shadowy figure behind her&mdash;the Godfather known as "Reaper," his father, whom he'd never met.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Am I that unappealing?" Alice sighed, feigning disappointment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who could resist someone like you?" Alexander replied with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alice blushed, meeting his gaze. "Mr. Hawthorne, besides Ms. Blackburn, are you involved with Lara and Betty too? I wonder what they have that I don't..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even a fool could see why Alice had come tonight.</span></p><div class="pagination">
