  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander, however, paid no heed and strode towards the manor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Halt! Anyone who disobeys the military order will be shot without mercy!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amid angry shouts, a dense array of gun barrels aimed at Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not only were there these hundreds of soldiers, but Alexander keenly sensed a dozen snipers targeting him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a flick of his hand, Alexander's Lightsaber materialized out of thin air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The resplendent blade light was so intense that the soldiers couldn't look directly at it, all revealing expressions of fear and shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, a powerful aura erupted from Alexander, unstoppable and unbreakable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The leading colonel, though armed, turned pale and weak-kneed, retreating several steps.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop. Stop right there! Otherwise... we really... will shoot..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The colonel stammered, unable to articulate his words clearly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander ignored him, calmly advancing towards the manor with his Lightsaber in hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if they fired, Alexander was unafraid.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the Force and Lightsaber, coupled with the swordsmanship from the Ultimate Legacy, even energy beams from laser weapons would be split apart, let alone bullets.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander took a step forward, and the colonel and his soldiers retreated a step.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander advanced three steps, and they retreated three steps as well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were many and heavily armed, but Alexander alone was the one controlling the situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone was dumbfounded, unable to comprehend this scene.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, wait!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A familiar, desperate cry rang out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava rushed over, tears streaming down her face, and hugged Alexander tightly from behind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Please wait. Just wait... Don't take risks. Wait for General Thompson and the others to come out, okay? I... I don't want to lose you..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava's </span><span>tears soaked</span><span> Alexander's back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's body stiffened, and his cold expression gradually softened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could disregard anyone for Ashley, but he couldn't ignore Ava, Lily, and so many lovers and friends.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, Alexander sheathed his Lightsaber.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The atmosphere, which had been tense to the extreme, instantly eased. The colonel and hundreds of soldiers wiped their brows in unison.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were the ones with the advantage, yet in the face of Alexander, they couldn't help but feel fear, drenched in cold sweat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was simply inconceivable!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, Quentin and Theodore emerged with smiles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quentin was leading a lovely little girl. Upon seeing Alexander, Ashley ran towards him crying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Daddy! Daddy!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's eyes moistened as he held Ashley tightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quentin laughed and said, "It's okay. Don't be afraid. Ashley is so cute."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander nodded indifferently, not offering them a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava and the others also breathed a sigh of relief. Conflicting with the military was clearly not a wise move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, the manor's door opened again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane and Belinda, along with more than a dozen members of the Fairfax family, were driven out, looking disheveled and miserable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane's hair was disheveled, and her face was bruised, clearly having been severely disciplined.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She turned and lunged inside, shouting, "Felix, you bastard. Give us back our property!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she was kicked down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get out! Get out and stay out!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Belinda sat on the ground, wailing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Jane, we don't even have a place to live now. What are we going to do?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It turned out that Felix had taken away the last of the Fairfax family's assets. The Fairfax family had become really destitute, the poorest of the poor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane looked at Alexander helplessly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Serves you right!" Alexander spat in front of her and got into the car with Ashley.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The vast convoy stretched out, speeding away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane became furious, screaming madly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, stop! Can't you help me for your daughter's sake?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the car, Alexander comforted Ashley while using Force Sense to examine her. Fortunately, he found no injuries.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he still felt a lingering worry. Felix had handed over Ashley so readily. Was there some conspiracy at play?</span></p><div class="pagination">
