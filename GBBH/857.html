  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The sword nearly grazed Norma's clothes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Haha..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A sinister laugh came from the Killer King's mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He envisioned Norma bleeding and dying instantly with a hole in her chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And a total reward of 500 million dollars would be easily obtained.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Go to hell!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A cold voice suddenly appeared in the ears of the Killer King, full of murderous intent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Killer King's ears ringing, his body shook violently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Almost at the same time, a sharp sound of exploding appeared in his ears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander's fist tore through the air, making a terrifying whistling sound like supersonic speed, which could definitely blow the Killer King to pieces with one punch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Oops!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Killer King's face changed drastically. If he wanted to kill Norma, he would also die.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Killer King had no choice but to withdraw his attack, and with a strange movement of his body, he miraculously dodged Alexander's punch and quickly approached him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If he had hesitated just now, he would have been killed by Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Killer King, who had been extremely relaxed, suddenly felt anxious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He never expected that there would be such a powerful man beside Norma.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The sneak attack had failed. If he persisted, he wouldn't leave intact.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He better run away now!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Killer King then turned and ran.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander was also surprised.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Few could evade his punch, and he hadn't anticipated the Killer King's immense strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Moreover, this guy was very sensible since he turned around and ran away immediately. No wonder he ranked at the top of the global killer list. He knew that keeping himself alive was the priority.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Killer King was like an agile rabbit, fleeing madly to the outside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Bang!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Suddenly, a gunshot was heard, and the bullet, wrapped in flames, flew at an incredible speed, almost sticking to the Killer King's head, splashing a trail of blood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was Marvin who fired the shot, and the bullet was attached with fire power, so it was faster and more powerful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But it was a pity that the Killer King dodged faster and only had his scalp scratched.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Killer King had been unbelievably strong, and he could predict other people's attacks in advance, but he still couldn't altogether avoid Marvin's attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Oh, no!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Killer King's expression became even darker.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The guy who fired the gun was no weaker than him, and his escape was interrupted by the shot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Killer King suddenly felt that there was someone behind him. It was Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander simply took a step forward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It looked like a straightforward step, and Alexander came behind the Killer King faster than the latter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The fist, wrapped in a strong wind, smashed hard into the Killer King's back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>How fast!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Killer King's face turned pale, and he deeply regretted taking this task.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He had been full of confidence, but he didn't expect that there was someone in the world who was faster than him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Facing Alexander's fatal blow, the Killer King widened his eyes and burst out with all his potential.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He rolled to the side suddenly and barely avoided Alexander's punch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, before the Killer King could even catch his breath, an even more terrifying pressure came towards him like a mountain, absolutely crushing him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The creepy and horrifying aura of death rushed in from all directions, making the Killer King feel incredibly cold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He felt like he was trapped in a shrinking room, with pressure from all sides, no place to hide, and all his escape routes were entirely blocked by the opponent's force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If he were an ordinary strong man, he would just wait for death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But he was the Killer King, the top killer. At the last moment, when facing the threat of death, he drew his sword and stabbed Alexander in the lower abdomen in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The angle of the blow was highly tricky like a poisonous snake launching a sneak attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Well!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander couldn't help but be surprised. This guy's skills were even comparable to Bruno's and definitely not weaker than Shadow's.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even strong men like Augusta and William would most likely be injured by the blow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But the Killer King was facing Alexander, the last Warrior.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander had punched with his bare hands before, but this time, he finally used the Lightsabers.</span></p><div class="pagination">
