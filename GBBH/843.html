"I'm not here for the audition. Let them undress."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Oh, my God! Boss, you want me to undress too? Are you asking me to be an actor as well?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marvin looked stunned, a slight blush appearing on his dark face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander held back a laugh and said coldly, "What? You dare disobey my orders?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marvin, unable to refuse, started unbuttoning reluctantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Being confident in his physique, Marvin didn't mind at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Keith was filled with anticipation, eager to redeem himself. He quickly undressed without hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The woman glared at Alexander in annoyance. "Then why are you here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She was about to call for security to remove him, but Alexander's gaze hypnotized her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She seemed unable to see Alexander anymore and instead focused intently on Marvin and Keith.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander stood off to the side, watching the hundreds of undressed men with a bemused smile, feeling as if he were observing from a superior vantage point.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The other interviewers, seeing that the supervisor didn't ask Alexander to undress, assumed he was a high-ranking inspector from the company and worked even harder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What is this, a worm or a pinky finger? How dare you come to audition with that? Get out!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>One interviewer shouted angrily, raising a baton and striking an embarrassed older man hard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ow! Please, stop hitting me... Please hire me, it's my lifelong dream..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The older man cried out, pleading as he was struck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The interviewer grew angrier, wishing he could hit the old fool again. How could someone with that size satisfy anyone?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A few staff members lifted the old man and punched him in the stomach several times until he spat out foam, dragging him out mercilessly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing this, Keith felt a surge of emotions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He recalled his first time applying; although he hadn't been hit, he was harshly mocked and kicked out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But now, things were different&mdash;he had improved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Keith felt deep gratitude toward Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Thirteen inches? What are you doing here? Get out!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Fourteen inches? Not qualified!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Fifteen inches? Still not enough!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A dozen female examiners, holding measuring tapes in one hand and handling the candidates with the other, measured with practiced precision.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Their eyes widened as they focused intently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Oh! This one is great&mdash;nineteen! Excellent!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The lead woman measured Keith and let out a delighted cheer, as if she had discovered new land.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Nineteen inches? Not bad, not bad. It's been a while since we've had such a promising candidate."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Several interviewers gathered around, squeezing Keith's waistband with interest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Keith's body tensed, swelling to its maximum, like a fierce dragon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This gentleman is impressive too&mdash;reaching a remarkable twenty inches. No wonder, being well-built."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Today wasn't in vain; we finally found two promising candidates."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The female examiners whispered excitedly among themselves, alternately handling Keith and Marvin for comparison.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A few even approached and smelled.</span></p><div class="pagination">
