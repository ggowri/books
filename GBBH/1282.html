  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Next, Alexander began to dissect the mutated bison.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After his previous attempts, he was well aware that mutated beasts were edible, and their meat was surprisingly delicious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It had been ages since he'd enjoyed tender beef, and with such a prime opportunity before him, he was determined to feast.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Practice what I taught you!" he instructed, handing Sally the cleaver.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sally took the knife, her grip firm as she followed Alexander's guidance and started practicing her chopping technique.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Heavy breaths soon filled the air, but she refused to take a break, gritting her teeth and pushing through.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She understood that encountering a powerhouse like Alexander in this post-apocalyptic world was a stroke of luck she couldn't afford to waste.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he ever left, she needed to be able to fend for herself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Alexander sliced the tenderest cuts of meat from the bison and placed them over the campfire to roast, he turned his attention to the beast's impressive horns.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each horn was over three feet long and thick, resembling the trunk of a small tree.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They glimmered with a faint blood-red hue, displaying remarkable toughness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He picked one up, channeling the Force to twist it. To his surprise, it didn't break, only bending slightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Curious, he pulled out his Lightsaber to test it. The saber sliced through the horn with ease, but he felt a subtle resistance that was unusual.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had cut through light armor before without encountering this kind of feedback, indicating that these horns were something special.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What a find!" Alexander marveled, tracing the mysterious spiral patterns on the horns.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He decided to keep them; they might be useful for crafting spears later.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, they were too long, so he used the Lightsaber to trim them down, leaving just the sharp tips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The bison's hide was also incredibly tough. While not as strong as the horns, it certainly surpassed the best protective gear available.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a moment's thought, he skinned the hide off with the Lightsaber and washed it clean with fresh water.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, I... I can't go on anymore..." Sally gasped, drenched in sweat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her hands trembled from gripping the knife, and her entire body shook with exhaustion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Take a five-minute break, then chop another three thousand times!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander replied casually, focused on organizing the hide and horns while keeping an eye on the meat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sally blinked, momentarily stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't dare argue, and after a brief rest, she obediently resumed her practice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander glanced at her from behind, nodding slightly. He hadn't expected Sally to possess such a strong will; she truly deserved the time he was investing in her training.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By the time Alexander finished his tasks, Sally was sprawled on the ground, her ample chest rising and falling with labored breaths.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The meat on the campfire had turned a perfect golden brown, and Alexander sprinkled some salt over it before waving her over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's call it a day for practice. Come eat!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sally sprang to her feet, her body aching, but the aroma of the roasted beef was too enticing to resist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wow! This is delicious!" she exclaimed after taking her first bite, even though the meat was still steaming hot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She couldn't help but devour it eagerly, praising it between bites.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander savored the roasted beef as well, marveling at the quality of the mutated bison's meat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had never tasted anything so delectable, even with just a sprinkle of salt and a slightly charred exterior.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, they had polished off several pounds of roasted beef.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander patted his slightly rounded belly, then got back to work.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He planned to roast dozens of pounds to take with them, not wanting to waste such a precious resource.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately, they couldn't carry the entire bison, and with the heat, the meat would spoil quickly. Salting and roasting it would help preserve it for a while.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sally hurried over to lend a hand, eager to help.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey!" Sally suddenly exclaimed, jumping to her feet in astonishment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She flailed her arms excitedly, even picking up the cleaver and performing rapid chopping motions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander furrowed his brows, perplexed. "What's going on? Have you lost your mind?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Breathless with surprise and joy, Sally replied, "Alexander, I just realized something amazing!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Eating this bison meat not only restored my strength, but my muscles don't feel sore anymore. It's like my body is bursting with energy!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she spoke, her movements with the knife became faster and more powerful, clearly showing her newfound vigor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At first, Alexander's expression was serious, but then a spark of excitement began to illuminate his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's fantastic news! This must be a blessing from above. Who would have thought that consuming mutated beast meat could actually enhance one's abilities?"</span></p><div class="pagination">
