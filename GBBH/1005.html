  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander stared at Lilian with cold, unyielding eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're Asher's woman, right? You know where he is. Tell the truth!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lilian rubbed her sore ears and sized Alexander up and down with a snort of disdain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She argued, "Mr. Hawthorne, are you used to bullying women? What makes you think I have any relationship with Asher? I'm just a TV reporter here to report the truth."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander sneered, his words sharp and deliberate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You still have Asher's scent on you. If I'm not mistaken, you slept with him last night."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lilian's face paled, shock flashing in her eyes as she stared at Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Asher is vicious! He bribed Julian to poison the magic powder in the warehouse, stirring up public outrage, and used it to blackmail us into handing over the formula.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He even called my good-for-nothing uncle and shamelessly used my daughter's recording to threaten me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And then scum reporters like you report lies, manipulating the truth to destroy the reputation of the potion and bring down the Brilliant Group. Right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every word Alexander spat sent Lilian stumbling backward, her expression growing </span><span>livid by the second.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By the time he finished, she had backed herself into a corner with nowhere left to retreat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She retorted sharply, "What nonsense are you spewing? I don't even know Asher! I don't know what you're talking about. Don't slander innocent people! I'll call the police!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm slandering you? Let's see if you really have no connection to Asher."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's sneer only deepened. His eyes were seeing through her lies as if they were glass.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He vanished abruptly from his spot, flickering in and out of sight like a specter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the blur, the crowd witnessed her cellphone materialize in his grasp as if conjured from thin air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What do you think you're doing? Robbery! He stole my phone! Someone, call the police! I'm a TV reporter!" Lilian screamed, thrashing about like a madwoman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But no one came to her aid. Everyone glared at her, waiting for the truth to surface.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without wasting a second, Alexander began to go through her phone. Lilian, realizing what was happening, panicked and tried to make a run for it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Want to run? Not so fast."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander yanked her back effortlessly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd of people who had come to confront Alexander and the Brilliant Group stood in silence, watching Alexander with new eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had previously used the magic powder without a hitch, but as of last night, a sudden tide of "side effects" swept through, with poisonings cropping up like dark blossoms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Alexander's revelation that Asher was the mastermind, the crowd, far from foolish, sensed the undercurrent of deceit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander held Lilian's wrist in an iron grip, rendering her helpless no matter how much she struggled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lilian, your conspiracy with Asher is all over your phone. There's no escaping this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This incident not only damaged my reputation and the reputation of the Brilliant Group, but it also harmed countless consumers who use the magic powder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Everyone, take heart. Both I and the Brilliant Group are victims here. I'm calling the police this instant! We'll unravel this mess and force the Vance family to restore the powder's good name, and I swear, you'll all be compensated ten times over!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words hit like a sledgehammer, decisive and unshakable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unless they had ulterior motives, everyone </span><span>present</span><span> now understood what was really going on. A few nodded in agreement, and soon, a ripple of approval spread through the crowd. Some even clapped, showing their support for Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander wasted no time. He pulled out his phone and dialed Oliver in front of everyone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Asshole! Let me go! Asher and I have nothing to do with each other! I don't know him! You're kidnapping me. Let me go!" Lilian shouted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her once-pretty face twisted into a mask of sheer ferocity as her features contorted with rage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She struggled in Alexander's grip. Her breasts heaved with each breath, but no amount of twisting or writhing could free her from Alexander's grasp.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Like an eagle swooping down on a helpless chick, there was simply no avenue for escape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava declared loudly, "Here at Brilliant Group, we vow to nab the true culprit and make things right for everyone affected. I'm confident that once the dust settles, you'll all see whether our product has any side effects or not. Don't let those villains pull the wool over your eyes!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As soon as the police get here, they'll uncover the truth. If it turns out that our Brilliant Group is at fault, we won't shy away from it; we'll double the compensation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But if Asher is behind this, then our Brilliant Group will spearhead the charge for justice on behalf of everyone here, and we'll demand compensation from the Vance family to the tune of ten times the damage!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her words resonated with the crowd. People who had been suspicious just hours ago were now nodding in agreement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sound of police sirens wailed in the distance. More than a dozen police cars came speeding toward the building.</span></p><div class="pagination">
