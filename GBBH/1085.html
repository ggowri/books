My last name is Hawthorne. Your wife and daughter asked me to rescue you," Alexander said with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ah. I'm okay. Thank you, Mr. Hawthorne. Thank you so much. If it weren't for you, I would be in big trouble."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alvin turned red with excitement, not knowing what to say.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander turned around and went up to the frightened Jordan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Jordan, bear in mind killing him is easier for me than crushing an ant."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jordan looked sullen, not daring to say anything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He was not stupid, knowing with Alexander's strength, it would be useless even if he had more people on his side.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander looked at Lanny and said with a smile, "Villain, today I will kill you as a warning to the rest."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His cold murderous aura frightened Lanny, who was trembling all over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Plop."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Lanny got on his knees and begged for mercy from Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'm sorry. I was wrong. Please forgive me. I was blind. I was wrong. I was wrong..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Lanny apologized and slapped himself in the face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander ignored him, giving him a kick.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Bang."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Lanny flew backward like a bowling ball, knocking several people to the ground and fainting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After a burst of exclamations, a silence fell upon the place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although Jordan outnumbered Alexander, he was rooted to the ground as if he were cast a spell.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander glanced around with sharp eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>No one dared to meet his gaze. They all lowered their heads, trembling all over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Jordan, this is a warning. If you dare to covet the All-purpose Bullet-resistant Jacket, you'll end up like Lanny."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After he spoke, Alexander left the bar calmly with Alvin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The people behind cast awed, angry, and unconvinced gaze at Alexander, but he didn't even look back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Bang."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The door of the bar closed, and Alexander and Alvin left like that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jordan breathed a sigh of relief. He had been fearing that Alexander would kill him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this time, a subordinate came over and asked sulkily, "Mr. Nicholson, shall we give up like this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jordan gritted his teeth and said ferociously, "He dreams. I must acquire the technology of the All-purpose Bullet-resistant Jacket. I'll hire more experts and catch them all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Take your men with you to follow Alexander. Keep an eye on them around the clock and stand by to take my orders."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Yes, Mr. Nicholson."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The subordinate quickly ran out with a few men.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jordan said with a smirk, "Alvin, you can't get rid of my mind-controlling potion. You will come to me for help soon."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the hotel room, the Duncan family hugged each other and cried bitterly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Dad, we are finally safe. Thank you, Alex."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Maxine looked at Alexander gratefully with tears in her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander frowned. He put his hand on Alvin's shoulder and said, "Mr. Duncan, I sense you're weak. Did anything happen to you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Emma and Maxine looked at Alvin in surprise, realizing something was wrong.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alvin's hair had turned grey, and his face was haggard. He was in his forties, but he looked old.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Well..." Alvin sighed heavily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne, you are an expert. I didn't expect you to notice it..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"During my captivity, Jordan not only tortured me for the information but also injected me with an addictive potion that was fiercer than drugs in an attempt to completely control me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If you hadn't rescued me, I would have broken down and given them all the technical information."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What? A mind-controlling potion?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Jordan is despicable!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Duncan family was shocked and furious, and Maxine even jumped up in anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Alvin suddenly covered his head and fell to the ground listlessly, muttering, "My head is aching. Hurry up. Give me the potion."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He screamed and rolled on the ground, even shouting that he would go out to see Jordan. He looked more miserable than those drug addicts.</span></p><div class="pagination">
