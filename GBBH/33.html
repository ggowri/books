  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jane thought, "My dream of instant wealth and prestige crumbled to dust, and the Hawkins family's downfall was sealed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The illusion of overnight success, of rising above others, now seemed like nothing more than a cruel nightmare."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jane stood frozen, lost in her thoughts, until Anne signaled, and security guards brusquely escorted Jane out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Throughout the ordeal, Ava's eyes never left Alexander, who avoided her clear, piercing gaze, fearing his true identity might be uncovered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He wasn't ready to reveal himself, especially not to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Chairman..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When Ava approached with an enthusiastic greeting, Alexander turned on his heel and walked away instantly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Anne stepped in, blocking Ava with a diplomatic smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Ms. Blackburn, the chairman has urgent matters. You'll host the ball."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Like a swift shadow, Alexander weaved through the crowd, disappearing down a hallway.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava was left puzzled and thought, "Why did he leave without a farewell? Was he afraid of meeting me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Ms. Blackburn, I heard you brought a dance partner tonight. I'm intrigued. Could you introduce him?" Anne asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Despite her smile, there was a fleeting spark of jealousy in her beautiful eyes. She was well aware of Alexander's true lineage.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava frowned and pondered why Alexander had been in the restroom for an unusually long time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Ms. Blackburn, I'm sorry. I had a bit of an upset stomach."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander came back, breathless. His expression showed his apology for the delay.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Rolling her eyes, Ava then laughed softly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Today, I'd like to introduce someone special. He's my dance partner and my boyfriend, Alexander."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The announcement sent ripples of shock through the room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even though this outcome was anticipated by all, many felt jealous, unable to mask the hostility flickering in their eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As the formidable president of Saint Group, Ava had always been an enigma when it came to romance. No one had ever heard of her being involved with a man. Over the years, numerous affluent magnates had sought her affection, only to be met with her unyielding rejection.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"This guy's hit the jackpot!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"He wins the world!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Whispers began to swirl around the room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Ava is the lucky one," Anne murmured with jealousy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Standing beside Ava, Alexander smiled as Ava naturally linked her arm with his. They looked like they were made for each other.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Amidst the murmurs, Alexander declared boldly, "Though I may not seem worthy of Ms. Blackburn now, one day, you'll see that I stand equal to any big shot."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With a satisfied look, Ava gazed at him and said, "Let's share our first dance."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Hand in hand, they stepped onto the dance floor, moving gracefully to the music.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Their dance was a vision of harmony, eliciting heartfelt applause.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Soon, others joined, and the ball reached its zenith.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Here, the elite mingled. Among them, some were on a quest for romance, while others seized the moment to find business alliances.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After their dance, Ava introduced Alexander to key figures.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This marked Alexander's inaugural venture into the echelons of high society. Once upon a time, such an event would have set his nerves alight with anxiety, but now, he found himself enveloped in an unexpected calm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The strength that surged within him had not only fortified his body but had also emboldened his spirit, allowing him to navigate this opulent sea with an ease he had never known before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Ms. Blackburn, how's your health? My grandson, a specialist in cardiovascular diseases, could assist with your condition."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Oscar Stewart, an elderly gentleman in a tailored suit, greeted Ava.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava quickly responded, "Sir Stewart, thanks to my boyfriend, my angina is cured."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Really? Is he a physician?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Oscar's tone carried a hint of displeasure.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He had harbored hopes of pairing Ava with his grandson, yet Ava had suddenly claimed Alexander as her boyfriend.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Furthermore, Alexander was an enigma, unrecognized by the glittering assembly. Thus, none afforded him the gravity he might have deserved.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"As long as my grandson has a chance to interact with Ava, his excellence will surely win her over," Oscar mused silently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Endowed with the Force, Alexander was acutely attuned to the undercurrents of emotion around him. Sensing Oscar's veiled animosity, his response was as cold as the steel of a drawn blade.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I am no physician. Yet, I have managed to soothe the pangs of my girlfriend's angina."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Oscar let out a chuckle. His smile threaded the needle between jest and earnestness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Ms. Blackburn, one mustn't jest about matters of health. You need a thorough examination, lest you find yourself deceived in ignorance."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava's smile vanished instantly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Sir Stewart, are you implying something about my boyfriend? To insult him is to belittle me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Oscar's face contorted into a scowl as he retorted with a note of discontent, "Ms. Blackburn, my concern is genuine. Would I wish harm upon you?"</p><div class="pagination">
