  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How dare you! Open your eyes and see who's in front of you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yvonne snapped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The patrol captain glanced at Alexander, his face paling instantly. He dropped to one knee, saying,</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Forgive me, Mr. Hawthorne!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Turns out, he was one of Shadow's men.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander gave a casual smile and waved him off. "Get up. You did fine."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The patrol officers all bowed their heads, quickly stepping aside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The woman stood there, stunned. She had no idea this young guy was such a big shot on Treasure Island.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before she could say more, Alexander turned and got in his car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was definitely interested in the auction she mentioned and planned on checking it out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The woman watched Alexander's convoy until even the taillights disappeared. Then, a cold, almost sinister smile was put on her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She pulled out a satellite phone and fired off a quick message: [Ghost has made contact. Target confirmed for the auction. Operation Fox Hunt begins.]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After sending the message, she vanished into the alley.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, Alexander's convoy pulled up at the Brilliant Tower.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cloe and William were already waiting, along with Shadow and Marvin, who had returned early.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Boss!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The group cheered when they saw Alexander step out of the car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cloe and Yvonne shook hands, their eyes locking as they sized each other up with complex expressions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Women are intuitive&mdash;especially when it comes to other beautiful women.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both of them could tell the other had something special with Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander told Yvonne and the others to rest, then looked at Cloe. "I heard there's an auction. Let's go check it out."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cloe's eyes lit up&mdash;that was exactly what she'd hoped for.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sir, let me take you. There are some real treasures this time."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yvonne gave Alexander a slightly resentful look, like she had something to say but held back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No need to come with me. Rest up, then head back to the City of Sorcery. They need you there."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's tone was firm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, sir!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yvonne knew better than to argue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cloe led the way, guiding Alexander to the hall where the auction would be held.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Behind them, William and Marvin exchanged glances, barely hiding their grins.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The hall was empty at the moment&mdash;not a soul in sight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sir, I missed you so much!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cloe suddenly threw herself into Alexander's arms, hugging him tightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander wrapped his arms around her waist, his hands resting on her firm backside, giving it a gentle stroke.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"When's the auction starting?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Nine o'clock... we've got over an hour..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cloe's voice was soft, her cheeks flushed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander looked at her coy expression, feeling a sense of satisfaction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was the one who had turned Cloe from a shy girl into the confident woman she was now. Her fuller, more alluring body was all thanks to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Still holding each other, they made their way to the restroom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cloe teased, "Let me freshen up a bit..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She walked over to the sink, turned on the faucet, and bent down, using a paper towel to clean herself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander admired the curve of her hips as she bent over&mdash;no longer the awkward girl she used to be but a mature, voluptuous woman, dripping with temptation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A woman's full curves and lifted hips were irresistible to any man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander enjoyed the view as he moved closer, reaching out to stroke her backside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cloe felt herself heating up at his touch, unable to hold back anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She glanced at Alexander, her lips parting, whispering, "No one's in there... wouldn't it be exciting?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She nodded towards the women's restroom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Taking his hand, she led him inside, her hips swaying exaggeratedly, every step full of seduction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cloe really did miss Alexander, and Yvonne's appearance had only made her more anxious to secure his affection.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The hallway outside was quiet; anyone approaching would be easy to hear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was still plenty of time before the auction began, and it was completely deserted&mdash;perfect timing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander hadn't expected Cloe to be so bold, wanting to get intimate in a public restroom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he had to admit, the thrill was undeniable.</span></p><div class="pagination">
