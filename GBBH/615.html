  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cedric asked, "What do you mean, Olivia? I've risked my neck for your father, given up a lot for you. You should trust me to take care of you. Surely, you're not relying on this guy, are you? Is he your boyfriend?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a sly glance at Alexander, Cedric clearly had something up his sleeve.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Olivia replied confidently, "Cedric, you don't need to meddle in my affairs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The exchange is ours, and the Mafia can't keep it. My boyfriend will help me reclaim it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cedric sneered in response. "Ha! Your boyfriend's nothing. Thinking he can take on the Mafia? He's got a death wish."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He spat derisively and reached for Olivia's arm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Listen to me, stick with me, and you might just stay alive. Listen to this punk, and you're digging your own grave."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What are you doing? Let go of me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Olivia struggled free and hid behind Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's eyes turned steely as he said coldly, "You have ten seconds to get lost."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cedric laughed in disbelief, dismissing Alexander completely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't think I don't know your game. You only say you can handle the Mafia to get Olivia in bed. Be smart and walk away now, or I'll make you regret it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ignoring Cedric, Alexander began to count down, saying, "Ten, nine, eight, seven..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cedric was seething, his jaw twitching with irritation as Alexander showed no sign of backing down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You must be an idiot! What good is counting down ten seconds? You're nothing to </span><span>me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfazed, Alexander kept saying, "Three more seconds, three, two..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A spark of fury crossed Cedric's eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're asking for it, moron!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hurled a punch at Alexander's face with all his might.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But with a casual swat, as if brushing away a fly, Alexander countered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cedric staggered, reeling from the blow, clutching his face in agony as it swelled up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I told you, make your exit in ten seconds," Alexander said before booting Cedric away with a swift kick.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The air around seemed to chill as Cedric writhed on the ground, clutching his stomach in pain that felt like it was tearing him apart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, he realized Alexander wasn't someone to cross.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You'll regret this!" Cedric blustered weakly as he staggered to his feet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Holding his aching body, he turned and fled, his retreat clumsy and humiliating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Watching him go, Olivia felt a mix of triumph and concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Will he come back for revenge?" she asked cautiously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry. That's not a concern anymore," Alexander reassured with a smile. A mere aunt like Cedric was hardly worth a second thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Witnessing Alexander's confidence, Olivia felt a pang of guilt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm sorry, this is all because of me," she said sheepishly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Olivia, you're with me now. What's yours is mine. No need to apologize," Alexander replied, pulling her close.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He added, "Let's head to the secret exchange, it's about time."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Together, they exited the hotel, making their way to Rose Market.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Cedric, nursing his swollen face, hid in a corner and made a call.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Some punk took a swing at me. Get some guys over here to teach him a lesson... Yeah, hurry."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hanging up, he cursed under his breath, "That bastard will get what's coming to him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, the side of his face that had been hit began to itch fiercely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sensation spread quickly, an unbearable itch that snaked down to his neck, arms, and beyond.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What the hell? Why is it itching so bad?" he murmured as he scratched frantically, but the irritation only intensified.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Within minutes, Cedric felt as though his skin was being gnawed on by countless ants.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His relentless scratching left angry welts across his skin, swollen and grotesque.</span></p><div class="pagination">
