  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander sighed and rubbed his forehead. "Yeah, you're strong. Teach me that Energy Plot Attack."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vegeta felt an overwhelming sense of satisfaction, like eating an ice pop on a scorching summer day.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sir, I won't hold anything back!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, the battlefield was cleared. Hundreds of bandits had either been killed, fled, or surrendered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nova led his men to finish cleaning up and reported to Alexander, "Sir, we captured over a hundred bandits, seized more than thirty warhorses, around thirty sets of steel chainmail and heavy crossbows, and over two hundred sets of leather armor and spears."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was thrilled. Money had been tight lately. He was practically out of savings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Not bad! We've spent a fortune fortifying the estate. Warhorses and heavy crossbows are restricted goods in Hrodvik. You can't buy them even if you have the money. Altogether, this haul is worth at least twenty thousand coins."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Logan scratched his head and said to Alexander, "Alexander, what if we recruit those hundred bandits? Mix them in with Vegeta's men and have them serve as estate guards."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Half an hour later, a thousand soldiers from the southern garrison of Darwin, led by a deputy general, arrived at Kean Manor, only to find a massive pile of a hundred corpses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smiled and cupped his hands. "Thank you, Mr. Shaw. The bandits have already scattered, and their leader's whereabouts are unknown."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bryson Shaw returned the salute. "Mr. Hawthorne, do you know where these bandits came from?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander paused for a moment. "I heard them calling their leader 'Josh,' but I'm not sure where they're from."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bryson frowned.&nbsp;Josh? Could it be from the infamous Tiger Gang?&nbsp;But the Tiger Gang was deep in the Oxhead Mountains, ten thousand miles from Darwin. How had so many of them made it here?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After sending off Bryson, Alexander and his men returned and gathered in the main hall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kneeling in the hall were two prisoners. Josh and a young boy. Their joints had been dislocated, and they were tightly bound with wet sinew ropes, unable to even move their fingers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's eyes gleamed coldly. He remained silent, calmly sipping water from a clay cup.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Logan suddenly roared, "Who are you? Where did you come from? Why did you attack Kean Manor?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two prisoners exchanged glances but remained silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smirked with disdain. He had dealt with people like this before. He ordered the estate guards, "Take them down to the dungeon. Keep them separated. Do whatever it takes. Don't let them sleep, don't let them die. Force-feed them if necessary. If they still refuse to talk after a month, send them to Darwin's court."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The estate guards dragged the prisoners away. Josh and the boy flinched, their faces turning pale.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The group continued discussing matters in the hall for a long time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the end, Alexander cursed harshly. "First Rhodes Monroe, now the Tiger Gang. Julius Wetherall must die! Who knows what other troubles lie ahead? From now on, we'll have patrols within a six-mile radius of the estate. Everyone needs to stay on guard! Vegeta, you're teaching me the Energy Plot Attack tomorrow."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone agreed and went to rest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next morning, a servant dressed in black rushed into the study at the Marshal's Mansion in Darwin. Moments later, an angry roar came from within.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get out! Useless fools!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The servant stumbled out, practically running for his life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, a striking young woman in a red dress emerged from the inner courtyard. She looked to be around twenty-five or twenty-six, with long, arched eyebrows and alluring eyes. Her fair chest rose high, her waist was slender like a snake's, and her curvy hips swayed gracefully as she stepped into the study. Faint voices could be heard inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Raegan, the Tiger Gang failed... It's still Rhodes Monroe... Xhantao..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, my lord... In a few months... Over in Xhantao..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Back at Kean Manor, Alexander hadn't returned to the Outer Court for days. He spent his time training with Vegeta, studying the energy wave technique.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Energy Plot Attack was indeed powerful, capable of boosting one's strength in an instant. But it wasn't sustainable. Unless absolutely necessary, it shouldn't be used.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, with his golden energy, Alexander figured he could maintain it for longer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unlike Vegeta, who could unleash a level-four warrior's attack despite being a level-three warrior&mdash;but would be drained after just one or two strikes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>That day was a martial arts lecture at the training hall. Alexander arrived early and secured a front-row seat. As time passed, more and more Outer Court disciples gathered, filling the hall.</span></p><div class="pagination">
