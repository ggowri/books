  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander said with certainty, "I've found a clue!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So fast!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Xavier and Beverly were extremely shocked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Gather the men and follow me. We're going to rescue her now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander immediately got into the car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Xavier quickly reminded, "Alexander, should we bring more men? It might be a secret hideout of the Mafia, and there might be terrifying wizards."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beverly nodded in agreement. "Yes, I'll call everyone together right away."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No need for too many people. Prepare three cars and bring a dozen men. The key is to secure the base."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was very confident, as if he wasn't going to rescue someone but just going for a trip.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry. Since they haven't taken Mandale Town yet, Alyssa won't be in danger. She's my person. No matter what danger she's in, I will bring her back. If it were any of you who were kidnapped, I would also do everything to rescue you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Alexander drove away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not only were Xavier and Beverly filled with excitement, but everyone present was deeply moved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They understood why Alyssa, Beverly, and so many others were willing to follow Alexander loyally.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander drove along the footprints of Alyssa for a while, and the footprints disappeared, replaced by two lines of tire tracks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These tire tracks must have been left by the kidnappers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Following the tire tracks, Alexander drove towards a remote mountain road.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The mountain road was winding and twisting, but there were no other vehicles, so the tire tracks were very obvious. Alexander sped forward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A dilapidated ancient castle stood on the mountaintop.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a dusty, old stone room, Alyssa was tied to a pillar, unable to move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In front of her were two wizards. Woodrow was fat and greasy, with a very obscene expression on his fat face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kerwin was very thin, with slightly protruding eyes and a very fierce gaze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, the two men were looking at Alyssa with greedy eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alyssa had an incredibly sexy and attractive figure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And she was tied up with hemp ropes, the ropes tightly wrapped around her body, making her already plump figure even more enchanting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her plump breasts seemed even larger under the tightness of the hemp ropes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is it your ability to sneak attack me? Let me go, and let's have a competition."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alyssa glared at them angrily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Woodrow laughed loudly, obscenely protruding his belly and pointing to his crotch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How do you want to compete? Do you want to serve me and then let's go to bed and compete?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kerwin also laughed continuously, staring at Alyssa with a lascivious look.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alyssa, I advise you to cooperate with us obediently. We can ensure your safety and only take half of the profits. If you don't agree, we will hand you over to the Mafia. They are not as cherishing of women as we are. At that time, you will be in unbearable pain even if you don't die."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alyssa sneered, "What's so great about the City of Sorcery? When Alexander comes, you will both die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kerwin disdained. "Alexander? What a shit! I'm afraid he won't come. I will kill him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alyssa spat on Kerwin's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kerwin was furious. He didn't expect Alyssa to be so stubborn, even when she was about to die.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He slapped Alyssa in the face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bitch! Even if Alexander comes, it's useless. Don't provoke me, or I will kill you now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Woodrow quickly stopped him, smiling and persuading, "Don't be so impatient, Kerwin. She's so sexy. We must play with her well, or it would be a waste.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I have already prepared aphrodisiacs. We will give her double the dosage. The leader of the Axe will become a slut who only wants men. How interesting that is.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"When we get tired of her, we will throw her onto the street and let all men play with her. This will be a fatal blow to the morale of the Axe!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kerwin's eyes lit up, and he clapped the fat man's shoulder excitedly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Woodrow, you are really thoughtful. You have even prepared the aphrodisiac. Let's do as you say!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
