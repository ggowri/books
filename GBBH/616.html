  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So itchy! Help! Someone, please help me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cedric </span><span>wailed,</span><span> his face contorted in agony as he scratched his body with a ferocity that tore at his skin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blood began to trickle from the fresh wounds, but Cedric was beyond caring.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The itch was all-consuming, gnawing at his very bones, driving him to the brink of madness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's happening to him?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is it contagious? Everyone, stay back! Someone </span><span>call</span><span> an ambulance, quick!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bystanders watched in horror as Cedric, acting like a man possessed, tore off his clothes and scratched his body into a bloody mess. His flesh was raw and bleeding, but still, he clawed at himself without mercy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a scene out of a horror movie. Cedric, covered in blood, looked more like a monster than a man. The crowd recoiled in fear, keeping their distance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Itchy, so itchy! Please, someone help me! Save me! Scratch this itch! Quick, please!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His cries for help went unanswered as his blood-stained clothes lay discarded on the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Cedric was nearing the brink of insanity, the ambulance finally arrived.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By then, his face and body were a grotesque mess of blood and torn flesh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To make matters worse, the skin he had scratched open now burned like fire as if roasted over hot coals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So Itchy and painful! Just kill me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cedric wished he could find a rock to bash his head in&mdash;anything to end the torment. The pain was worse than any torture he could imagine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking around, he realized with horror that many people were filming him with their phones.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stripped bare, he was a bloody mess. Shock and curiosity gleamed in the eyes of the onlookers, some even live-streaming his humiliation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cedric was so enraged that his vision swam, and the world around him blurred. The last thing Cedric felt was the hard ground beneath him before everything went dark.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Quick! Get him to the hospital!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The paramedics rushed in, loading Cedric onto a stretcher and whisking him away from his public nightmare.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Huh, what's going on over there?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Olivia noticed a crowd gathering, sirens blaring, police cars, and an ambulance on the scene.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander chuckled. He knew exactly what was happening.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Using the Force to scramble Cedric's nervous system, Alexander had given him a taste of illusion&mdash;one that would render him a broken man for the rest of his life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's not bother with that. Getting the exchange back is more important."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, follow me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Olivia nodded, and together, they made their way toward the market.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The massive sports arena was a buzzing hive of activity, with thousands of stalls and a sea of people milling about.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Olivia led Alexander to a locker room protected by a keypad lock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She punched in the code, and the door clicked open.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inside, Olivia rummaged through the lockers for a moment. Then, with a soft "click", one of the lockers shifted. A large ventilation duct was revealed behind it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is my father's secret passage. It leads to the underground exchange. The Mafia doesn't know about it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hand in hand, they slipped into the duct.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A few minutes later, they emerged into a vast underground hall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander never would have imagined that beneath Rose Market lay a hidden </span><span>exchange like this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The vast, open floor was meticulously arranged, with rows upon rows of display cases showcasing a stunning array of jewels, antiques, and valuable memorabilia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But what really caught Alexander's eye were the piles of rough gemstone ore scattered around the area.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In front of each mound of ore was a small sign providing details about the origin of the stones and what kind of gems might be found within.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dozens of staff in sleek black suits moved among the guests attending the trade show, offering their assistance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Most of the gemstone ore had been shipped all the way from Gatheolia and places like Soutaxia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A number of jewel merchants and a few guests with a keen interest in stone speculation were already examining the rough stones.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stone speculation was simple, really. One relied on one's eye for detail and one's experience to pick a stone. If it contained a gem, one hit the jackpot. If not, well, one was out of luck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But for Alexander, this was a piece of cake. His All-seeing Eyes allowed him to see straight through the ore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could instantly tell whether a stone held a gem or was worthless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To everyone else, these oddly shaped rocks were nothing more than ordinary stones. But to Alexander, they were something else entirely.</span></p><div class="pagination">
