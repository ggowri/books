  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander let out a laugh, "You devils! Bastards! You're all such hypocrites. If you want to fight, then bring it on! I'm not afraid of you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Arturo was fuming.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He snorted coldly, his hands twisting into snake-like shapes. With his body trembling, he combined his mind and body, employing the Eyes Removing technique to lunge at Alexander's eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All Alexander saw was Arturo barreling toward him, aimed straight at his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, the Force within Alexander surged wildly. Ignoring Arturo's attack, he bent down and sat, bringing his palms together to strike at Arturo's neck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Arturo was taken aback. Although he was a level-four warrior with a powerful physique, his neck was still a vulnerable spot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He quickly tilted his head and twisted his body, moving his hands. With a swift motion, he wrapped around Alexander's waist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander roared, quickly spinning around and swinging his arms downward. The sound sliced through the air as he unleashed his Harmonic Fist, directly targeting Arturo's lower body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Arturo cursed inwardly. Even though he could easily sever Alexander in two, he feared sustaining serious injuries himself. He had to twist his body and evade to the right of Alexander, launching a strike with the Venom Spitting technique.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gritting his teeth, Alexander infused his arms with fierce energy, executing the Muscle-Tendon Classic and Floral Grasp.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was a series of loud bangs, causing Alexander's arms to crack and his muscles to go numb. He felt himself being overwhelmed by a flurry of snake shadows. But the golden aura on his chest lived up to its reputation, sending a fierce wave of warmth throughout his body, dispelling the numbness from his muscles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The vortex of Force within Alexander spun wildly, his right palm glowing with green energy as he reached for Arturo's throat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing that Alexander's attack was aimed at his vital points, Arturo became enraged and chose not to dodge, bracing himself for the impact.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His face paled as he thrust his hands deep into Alexander's chest. A thunderous bang echoed as Alexander groaned, blood spattering from his mouth as he was sent flying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mid-air, Alexander swallowed a Life-Saving Pill whole. A surge of fiery medicinal power coursed through him, a warm wave rushing to his fractured ribs, bringing him an overwhelming sense of comfort.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though still airborne and about to crash to the ground, Alexander steadied himself with a burst of Force, lightly tapping the ground with his toes. His spine writhed violently as his body twisted and shot toward Arturo's lower body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Arturo, feeling the impact from Alexander's assault, gasped for air as he prepared to retreat into the cave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sound of air cracking filled the space as Alexander, who should have been falling, shot toward him with surprising speed. Shock coursed through Arturo; even a level-three warrior would have been defeated by him, yet here was Alexander, seemingly unfazed. Arturo realized Alexander was far from ordinary!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gathering his internal energy, Arturo shifted his body and executed the Snake Navigating move. His hands darted up and down, enveloping Alexander's form entirely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With gritted teeth, Alexander felt the Force within him reversing. He spat out a mouthful of blood as he suddenly gasped for air while suspended in the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a powerful push, he pressed his arms against the ground, releasing a spiral of Force that propelled him into a yoga handstand, his toes glowing blue as they aimed for Arturo's throat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Furious, Arturo bellowed and met the attack head-on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His face turned pale as he was thrown off balance, spinning in the air before delivering a forceful kick that sent Alexander crashing hard to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Watching the blood gush from Alexander, Arturo couldn't help but sneer, "You're still alive!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Forming his left hand into a snake shape, he unleashed the Snake Hissing technique, targeting Alexander's forehead directly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Isolde's face went pale, and tears were brimming in her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The vicious Risunese attacked relentlessly at the cave entrance, and despite Alexander being injured multiple times and spitting blood, he fought with everything he had.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Panicking, she glanced up just in time to see Alexander had been smashed into a deep pit, Arturo poised to crush his skull.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fear gripped her, and she cried out in anguish, "Alexander!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Arturo paused for a moment, stealing a contemptuous glance at Isolde, then returned his focus to Alexander, ready to deliver the final blow.</span></p><div class="pagination">
