  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Alexander pedaled swiftly down the road, he became increasingly aware of Sally pressed against his back, her body swaying with each bump in the road.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The monotony of the ride suddenly seemed much more interesting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a few hours of cycling, Alexander realized they had lost their way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The road signs in Kylaville's suburbs were sparse and poorly maintained, leaving him to rely solely on his sense of direction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As darkness began to fall, Alexander found an open area where they could set up camp for the night.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The spot was perfect&mdash;no buildings or dense forest within several hundred yards. With his heightened senses, Alexander had already confirmed there were no zombies or mutant creatures lurking around.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They worked efficiently to set up camp. Alexander used his machete to clear away some dry brush, while Sally took the initiative to gather fallen branches and leaves for the fire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, a warm campfire was crackling between them. The orange flames cast a soft glow on their faces. Sally was jumpy at first, constantly scanning their surroundings, but she eventually settled down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander set up a metal mess kit over the fire, cooking some dried rations and hot dogs for dinner. The smell of food filled the air, and Sally couldn't help but swallow hungrily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once the food was ready, Alexander pulled out another mess kit and split the rations and hot dogs evenly between them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sally slurped up the noodles with obvious enjoyment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander had noticed her hunger hours ago but hadn't offered her food, and she hadn't asked for any either.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This had been a deliberate test of her character, and Alexander was impressed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sally had proven herself to be both mature and resilient.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After finishing his meal, Alexander found a comfortable spot to lie down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sally took care of cleaning the mess kits and organizing Alexander's backpack before looking for her own place to rest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sally hesitated visibly for a moment before finally gathering her courage and moving into Alexander's arms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hold me, Alexander... I'm cold," she whispered softly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander responded with a gentle smile, making no move to push her away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was fear and sadness in Sally's voice that stirred his compassion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sally tilted her face up to his, her soft lips brushing against his cheek and the corner of his mouth with deliberate tenderness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not to be outdone, Alexander ducked his head and sucked on Sally's delicate neck, slipping his hand in her skirt and squeezing her smooth, plump ass hard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, his fingers were sliding along the crack of her ass, and within two strokes, Sally was letting out soft moans.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sally's body was flushed with pink, which made her look even more charming and gorgeous, especially her perfect long leg and round butt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander had to admit, Sally's looks and figure, while not quite on par with Ava and the others, were definitely first-rate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she kissed him, Sally slid lower, her lips trailing down his chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mmm..." Alexander watched as she began to take his cock in her mouth, but his size was almost too much for her delicate lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She could only manage to fit half of him in, the rest remained exposed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Still, the warmth and wetness of her mouth, the playful flicks of her tongue, and her seductive gaze, eyes locked with his, were more than enough to please him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To stay with Alexander, Sally was going above and beyond, offering a level of service even her boyfriend had never experienced.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She knew that in this world, only strength guaranteed survival. Money, status&mdash;it all meant nothing compared to raw power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And as an ordinary woman, all she had to offer was her body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thankfully, she was attractive and had a good figure. She was confident Alexander would be satisfied, or at least, wouldn't readily abandon her to the zombies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sally held his cock firmly with one hand, her head tilted, her tongue swirling and teasing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It had been nearly half a month since Alexander had been with a woman, and his patience was wearing thin. He pulled Sally onto his lap, her softness a welcome relief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Take your clothes off," he commanded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sally giggled, her body swaying seductively as she peeled off her nightgown, revealing her alluring curves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mmm!" A moan escaped her lips as she slowly lowered herself onto him, a wave of pleasure washing over her. It was a feeling of deep satisfaction, something she had never experienced before.</span></p><div class="pagination">
