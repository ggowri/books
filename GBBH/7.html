  <div class="container"><p>In the quiet hospital room, only Ava and Alexander remained, the silence so palpable that they could almost hear each other&#x27;s heartbeat.</p><p>Ava studied Alexander, her gaze filled with curiosity and confusion.</p><p>&quot;I&#x27;m really curious. With such an incredible ability, why did you live such a miserable life with the Fairfax family? And can I ask what your relationship is with the Godfather?&quot;</p><p>Alexander suddenly realized that this beautiful woman was one of his father&#x27;s subordinates, and she didn&#x27;t know his true identity.</p><p>He chuckled lightly.</p><p>&quot;I once loved Jane, but not anymore. As for the Godfather, I don&#x27;t know what you mean.&quot;</p><p>His expression shifted, revealing a mix of weariness, resignation, and anticipation for the future.</p><p>He had suddenly become the illegitimate son of the most powerful crime lord, the Godfather, and had also mysteriously inherited the Warrior legacy. Even Alexander himself couldn&#x27;t fully comprehend the bizarre turn his life had taken.</p><p>But in Ava&#x27;s eyes, Alexander&#x27;s stature seemed to grow even greater.</p><p>She felt he wasn&#x27;t just any man; he was a true gentleman and a noble soul.</p><p>He volunteered at a nursing home, showing kindness.</p><p>He possessed an extraordinary gift yet remained humble, even enduring humiliation for love.</p><p>&quot;What a remarkable man&quot;, Ava thought, her admiration for Alexander growing.</p><p>&quot;You&#x27;re a good man. Jane must be blind,&quot; Ava said with a smile, her eyes shining with approval.</p><p>Alexander smiled awkwardly.</p><p>&quot;Ms. Blackburn, your condition isn&#x27;t fully cured yet. While it won&#x27;t cause any more issues for now, you&#x27;ll need monthly treatments for the next six months for a complete recovery.&quot;</p><p>Ava gave him a playful look.</p><p>&quot;Do you just want an excuse to touch my chest again? Come on, what do you want in return?&quot;</p><p>As she spoke, she crossed her long legs and adjusted her stockings right in front of him.</p><p>The sheer, silky fabric clung to her smooth legs, accentuating their perfect shape. The sight was tempting, to say the least.</p><p>Alexander&#x27;s heart raced, and he licked his lips nervously.</p><p>&quot;Ms. Blackburn, I&#x27;m not doing this for any reward. Just like how you brought me to the hospital without expecting anything in return.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Are you sure? Won&#x27;t you regret it?&quot;</p><p>Ava teased, batting her lashes and seductively running her hand over her chest.</p><p>Alexander swallowed hard.</p><p>Seeing that he still wasn&#x27;t pouncing on her like a wild beast, Ava&#x27;s admiration deepened. A man who could resist such temptation was surely destined for great things.</p><p>Just as Alexander was about to reach out and embrace Ava, his phone suddenly rang.</p><p>It was Jane calling, and his expression immediately darkened.</p><p>As soon as he answered, Jane yelled into the phone.</p><p>&quot;Didn&#x27;t you agree to the divorce? Why aren&#x27;t you home yet? The lawyer is already here. Hurry up and sign the divorce papers! Don&#x27;t think for a second about backing out!&quot;</p><p>Her voice was so loud that even Ava, standing nearby, could hear every word.</p><p>Alexander&#x27;s voice turned cold.</p><p>&quot;Don&#x27;t worry. I&#x27;m done loving you, and I won&#x27;t back out. But mark my words, you&#x27;ll regret this for the rest of your life.&quot;</p><p>Jane&#x27;s mocking laughter rang through the phone.</p><p>&quot;Alexander, do you think borrowing half a million dollars from a loan shark will scare me? Let me tell you, my biggest regret in life is marrying you, and I never should&#x27;ve had Ashley. She&#x27;s nothing but a burden.</p><p>&quot;You&#x27;ve got thirty minutes to get here, or I&#x27;ll file a lawsuit!&quot;</p><p>With that, Jane hung up abruptly.</p><p>Alexander gripped his phone tightly, his anger bubbling over with no way to release it.</p><p>&quot;Jane, you can despise me, you can humiliate me, but you&#x27;ve crossed the line by abandoning our daughter. You don&#x27;t deserve to be Ashley&#x27;s mother!&quot;</p><p>Deep within him, whatever feelings he had left for Jane evaporated, replaced by seething fury. Her cruel words about their daughter had ignited a rage he couldn&#x27;t contain.</p><p>Ava, however, was secretly pleased. She smiled and said, &quot;Your car is still at the nursing home. I&#x27;ll drive you back. Otherwise, you won&#x27;t make it in thirty minutes.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Alright.&quot;</p><p>Alexander agreed without hesitation and turned to leave the room.</p><p>Ava was momentarily stunned. She thought, &quot;This man, so ordinary moments ago, suddenly exuded an aura of nobility and strength. Had it just been my imagination?&quot;</p><p>Shaking her head, Ava rubbed her temples and quickly followed him.</p><p>As they stepped outside, Emma and the bodyguards all bowed in greeting.</p><p>Emma spoke in a hushed voice, &quot;Ms. Blackburn, a few state senators and some stars have requested your company for dinner.&quot;</p><p>Ava waved dismissively.</p><p>&quot;Can&#x27;t you see I&#x27;m busy? I&#x27;m taking Mr. Hawthorne somewhere. Tell them I&#x27;ll meet with them when I&#x27;m free.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes, Ms. Blackburn,&quot; Emma replied, casting a glance at Alexander before dutifully heading off to arrange the car.</p><p>Soon, Ava and Alexander arrived at the entrance of the Fairfax Villa.</p><p>After stepping out of the car, Ava boldly took Alexander&#x27;s arm and smiled sweetly.</p><p>&quot;I&#x27;ll go in with you. I want to see what kind of fool Jane really is.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Huh?&quot;</p><p>Alexander was surprised by Ava&#x27;s sudden assertiveness, sensing a hint of rivalry in her tone.</p><p>After a moment&#x27;s thought, he laughed heartily.</p><p>&quot;Well, if you want to accompany me, how could I say no? It&#x27;s an honor to return home with such a beautiful woman!&quot;</p><p>A flash of satisfaction passed through Ava&#x27;s eyes. She felt this was a man who knew how to seize the moment.</p><p>She pressed herself closer, her ample chest squeezing against Alexander&#x27;s arm without hesitation.</p><p>As he felt the intoxicating softness of her body, his heart skipped a beat.</p><p>Instinctively, he wrapped his arm around her waist, resting his hand on her firm, round hips as they confidently walked into the Fairfax Villa.</p><p>The place was bustling with activity. Cars filled the driveway, and the entire house was buzzing with life.</p><p>After all, today was the day Jane was getting engaged to Ryan. Since the Hawkins family was a key partner of the Saint Group, Ryan was widely expected to be appointed as the group&#x27;s vice president. His future looked incredibly bright, so naturally, many were eager to curry favor with him.</p><p>Representatives from many prestigious families and companies had come to offer their congratulations.</p><p>&quot;Mr. Hawkins, here&#x27;s a pair of diamond rings to wish you and Ms. Fairfax a lifetime of happiness!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Mr. Hawkins, this is a hundred thousand dollars cash gift. Wishing you and Ms. Fairfax eternal joy!&quot;</p><p>Ryan could barely keep up with the flood of gifts, grinning from ear to ear.</p><p>On the other side of the room, Jane was surrounded by women who were showering her with flattery.</p><p>&quot;Ms. Fairfax, this is the latest Chanel collection. I hope you&#x27;ll like it.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Please, Ms. Fairfax, put in a good word for us with Mr. Hawkins. This diamond necklace is just a token of our appreciation.&quot;</p><p>Jane basked in the attention, her pride soaring.</p><p>With Alexander, these women had once been above her, but now they were fawning over her, eager to win her favor.</p><p>She regretted not leaving Alexander sooner. The five years with him had been a complete waste.</p><p>The grand hall was filled with dozens of tables.</p><p>People mingled, raising their glasses and discussing the news of the Saint Group&#x27;s upcoming vice president appointment with excitement.</p><p>Everyone had high hopes for Ryan&#x27;s chances, which was why they had come to shower him with praise.</p><p>In the midst of it all, Ryan pulled Jane into a kiss, and the room erupted in applause and cheers.</p><p>At that moment, Alexander and Ava walked in, and the faces of the Fairfax family turned pale.</p><p>Alexander sneered, &quot;Shameless. You&#x27;re already hosting an engagement party, and we&#x27;re not even divorced yet!&quot;</p><p>His icy voice cut through the room, echoing loudly in the suddenly quiet hall.</p><p>Dead silence fell. Every eye in the room was fixed on Alexander, filled with disbelief.</p><p>Today was supposed to be a day of celebration for the Fairfax and Hawkins families, yet there was Alexander, not offering congratulations but spitting scorn. To them, it seemed like he had a death wish.</p><p>&quot;Alexander, you&#x27;re dead meat!&quot;</p><p>Ryan and Jane stormed toward Alexander, fury written all over their faces.</p><div class="pagination">
