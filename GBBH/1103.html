  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The guard in the lead pulled out a scanner and carefully swept it over Alexander before nodding in approval.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At that moment, a young man quickly emerged from inside. As soon as he saw Grace, his face lit up with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Grace, you're back!" he exclaimed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dressed in designer clothes, the man exuded an air of confidence and sophistication. It was clear he was someone of notable status.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He greeted Grace enthusiastically but completely ignored Alexander, making it evident that he didn't consider him important.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Grace frowned, stepping back and instinctively moving closer to Alexander, putting some distance between herself and the man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Howard, we're not that familiar. There's no need to be so friendly," she said coldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Howard's smile faltered. His face stiffened, and his eyes narrowed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He had been adopted by Grace's uncle, Jaden Lawson, and had secretly harbored feelings for Grace, fantasizing about marrying her and becoming the son-in-law of the powerful Lawson family, ultimately taking control of their legacy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But now, faced with Grace's coldness, he dared not show his anger at her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Instead, his gaze turned to Alexander, filled with disdain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Grace quickly interjected, "This is Alexander, the one who healed Gavin's old injury last time. I've brought him here again, hoping he can help Gavin out of danger."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Hmph!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Howard grunted in displeasure, a clear sign of his growing irritation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The moment he heard Grace speak so highly of Alexander, and saw her so close to him, like a bird nestling up to its protector, his jealousy flared, and he immediately turned his hostility toward Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You're the one who claimed to have healed Gavin last time?" Howard sneered, his tone dripping with mockery. "And yet, Gavin's condition only worsened. What a joke."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He took a moment to scrutinize Alexander, his gaze dismissive and condescending.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before Alexander could respond, Grace was already furious, her voice rising sharply.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Howard, shut up! Stop talking nonsense!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Howard winced at the reprimand, but his resentment toward Alexander only deepened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After a tense pause, he finally spoke again, his voice tinged with skepticism. "Grace, this guy is too young. What help can he offer? Didn't you learn your lesson last time?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His lips curled into a sneer. "Why don't I just give him some money to leave? Let him walk away with a little profit, and we can forget this ever happened."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At his words, Grace's face darkened. Alexander wasn't just some healer to her&mdash;he was someone far more important, someone with whom she'd already shared a deep bond. She could never allow Howard to belittle him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Howard, how dare you speak like that?" she snapped, her voice icy. "You will apologize to Alexander, right now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Grace's tone was commanding, and she emphasized Alexander's name with fierce protectiveness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Howard's jealousy and bitterness only grew, his envy eating away at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Grace, you want me to apologize to him? I'm part of the Lawson family, whether you like it or not," he retorted, his voice rising in anger. "If word gets out about this, the Lawson family's reputation will be in ruins. Are you really willing to risk that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He clenched his fists in frustration. Despite being adopted, he was regarded as one of the Lawson family's closest members, second only to Grace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And now, in front of everyone, she was demanding he apologize to a man he saw as a complete nobody.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You've been taken in by this charlatan, Grace. If he really healed Gavin, why is Gavin still facing death's door?" Howard continued, his eyes narrowing. "You're too blinded by him. I'm telling you. This guy is nothing but a fraud!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With a mocking laugh, he reached forward, pushing a finger hard against Alexander's chest. "Listen here, kid," he threatened, his voice low and dangerous, "I suggest you stay away from Grace. If I see you getting any closer, I'll make sure you regret it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander's laughter caught him off guard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was so unexpected and unrestrained that Howard's face twisted in rage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What's so funny, huh? You think this is a joke?" Howard spat, his anger boiling over. "I have to admit, I'm impressed. You've got guts, I'll give you that. But you've crossed a line now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He waved his hand sharply, signaling his men to step forward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Someone deals with him!" he barked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In an instant, several figures emerged from the shadows, moving swiftly to encircle Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Stop!" Grace's voice rang out like a whip, sharp and commanding. "If anyone touches Alexander, I swear I'll make sure they never walk again."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her eyes blazed with fury, and the men hesitated, clearly intimidated by the raw authority in her voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They quickly backed off, retreating into the shadows.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Grace was the true heir of the Lawson family, and her position in the family&mdash;along with her deep connection to Gavin&mdash;gave her far more power than Howard could ever dream of.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He could only stand there, seething with frustration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You're so sure he can heal Gavin? After everything, you still trust him?" Howard sneered. "You've been duped once already. Don't let it happen again."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Grace's expression was cold as she looked him dead in the eye. "Don't tell me what to do. Stay out of my way."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She was so done with his nonsense that she wanted to kick him out of her life for good.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Howard refused to back down, his voice venomous as he shot a final glare at Alexander. "Leave. You're not welcome here. If you truly care about Gavin, you'll leave now. I won't let you deceive him any further. For all we know, you might be an assassin sent by an enemy faction."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander's expression darkened, his patience wearing thin. He had no intention of wasting another second on this foolish man.</span></p><div class="pagination">
