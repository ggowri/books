  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander didn't want to put Ava in a dilemma, so he said confidently, "You can give it a try. No medicine can cure this disease, and this medicine might not have the promised effect."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Vincent immediately ridiculed, "Do you really think you are a good doctor? Let me tell you, the developer of this new medicine is a Nobel Prize winner in medicine. You can't slander him."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander didn't bother to argue with him and just pretended not to hear that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Vincent thought Alexander was intimidated and quickly took out the new medicine with a smirk.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After Ava took the medicine, Vincent became more and more excited.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If he could really cure Ava, he might gain Ava's favor and strike a blow against Alexander. It would be of great help to him in pursuing Ava.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After a while, Ava suddenly covered her chest with her hands and looked painful.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I can't breathe. This medicine doesn't work."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Rebecca turned pale and questioned Vincent, "What's going on? Is something wrong?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Vincent was flustered. He had no idea why this happened.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He stammered, "Impossible! This shouldn't have happened. Ms. Blackburn has a different illness, so..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Shut up!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Before he could finish his words, Rebecca interrupted him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What do you mean by different illness? Vincent, if you hadn't begged me, I wouldn't have brought you here, let alone let Ava take this medicine."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If anything happens to Ava, I will never forgive you!" Rebecca shouted anxiously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I, I'll think of a way... Don't worry, I'll call and ask..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Vincent took out his cell phone in a hurry, but he couldn't hold it steadily and dropped it to the ground.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In fact, this new medicine was still in the clinical verification stage. In order to approach Ava, Vincent pushed his luck and gave it a try.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He wanted to get Ava like crazy and also wanted to take revenge on Alexander, who humiliated him yesterday.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At the critical moment, Alexander strode over and put his hand on Ava's chest, healing her with the Force.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When Vincent saw this, he became so jealous that his eyes turned red.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He shouted, "You bastard, what are you doing? You've delayed the treatment of Ms. Blackburn, and she is suffering from the attack. Go to hell. How dare you do this at this moment?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Rebecca was also angry.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Alexander, take your dirty hands away!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Ava is in danger now. How can you take advantage of her? You're shameless and disappointing."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander took a cold glance at them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'm her boyfriend. What's wrong with me treating her? I'm helping you clean up the mess. If I wasn't here, you would have killed Ava."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Vincent quickly defended himself, "Nonsense! The developer of this medicine is a famous medical scientist. There can't be any problem. It must be you who delayed Mr. Blackburn's treatment."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Rebecca, let's send Ms. Blackburn to the hospital now, lest she will be killed by this guy."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava waved her hand and said, "I trust Alexander. I don't need to go to the hospital..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After a while, Ava's pale face turned rosy, and the pain in her chest disappeared. She felt she was energetic.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava pressed Alexander's hand excitedly, feeling surprised and happy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'm fine now. I'm okay. Alexander, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have listened to Vincent's nonsense..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava looked at Alexander tenderly. This guy took the chance and groped her boobs just now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander chuckled and said, "Don't take medicines given by others carelessly in the future. I promise I will cure you completely."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava nodded vigorously, her eyes bright.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Vincent broke out in a cold sweat and tried to explain it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava waved her hand coldly and said, "Get out. I don't want to see you again."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Rebecca felt embarrassed and pushed Vincent out forcefully.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'm sorry, Alexander. I was deceived by Vincent."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She apologized with mixed feelings, and her prejudice against Alexander was slightly reduced.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, Rebecca didn't agree with Ava getting such a boyfriend.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander asked Ava to meet Lily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava instantly felt happy and leaned against Alexander, saying with a meaningful smile, "Do you want me to meet your elders so soon? You helped me again today, and I should repay you, but it's too early for me to marry you."</p><div class="pagination">
