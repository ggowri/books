  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The flying knife broke through the air, flashing a light of death, and completely enveloped Shadow's figure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aaron had unleashed all his powers, controlling more than a dozen throwing knives to shoot at Shadow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Among the other metahumans, most had strength-related powers, and two had fire power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They burst out with all their strength and attacked Shadow with all their might.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The overwhelming flying knives were like a dragnet, mixed with bursts of scorching flames, which was fire power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The power metahumans rushed at Shadow like mad rhinos.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aaron felt that no matter how strong Shadow was, he would not dare to underestimate them in the face of such a siege.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your strength is good, but your speed is too slow. Everything in the world can only be defeated by speed!" Shadow smiled sinisterly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before he finished speaking, he had disappeared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His speed was so fast that it could not be distinguished by the naked eye, and Shadow seemed to disappear into the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next moment, the metahuman who was rushing in the front screamed, and his head and body were separated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The head flew high, and blood spurted out like a fountain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, the second metahuman lost his head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was another flash of a knife, and the third one lost his head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was a one-sided bloody massacre!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The heads flew up along with blood and fell heavily to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The entire secret base seemed to become a slaughterhouse, where a violent butcher was slaughtering a group of poor pigs and sheep.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aaron felt like he was going crazy. No matter how he controlled the flying knife, he couldn't touch Shadow's clothes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next moment, his head flew high into the air, spinning in the air before falling to the ground. He only had time to shout before he died.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's fast! It's too fast!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It took less than half an hour for Shadow to enter the secret base guarded by over 100 people. The main target, Dave, the scientific research team led by Dave, and the guarding forces were all destroyed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shadow put Dave's head into a plastic bag, tied it tightly, and wrapped it in several more layers to ensure that the blood that had not yet completely dried would not flow out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, he placed the machete on Aaron's body and began to wipe it. The bloody machete soon turned shiny.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shadow took a few photos of the scene and sent them directly to the Red Umbrella Group's email address.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Godfather said that his granddaughter should not be hurt. Mr. Anthony Hawthorne, you disobeyed Godfather's order. This is one of the prices you should pay!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shadow stood quietly in the blood, a meaningful smile on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Godfather, I follow your teachings and develop the human body's potential. My sword skills have reached a high level, enough to enter the top ten of the global master </span><span>list</span><span>. I hope to have the opportunity to break through the peak of martial arts and fight against high-level metahumans. Then, I will have no regrets in this life!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It turned out that Shadow was a disciple of Godfather, who was an extremely powerful master who had even reached a state of unity between humans and nature.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Masters rely on developing the potential of the human body to reach a higher level of strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the metahumans of the Red Umbrella Group were mass-produced using technological means, and Shadow really looked down on them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He spat on the corpse before leisurely leaving the base.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were already several cars waiting outside. After Shadow got in the car, someone immediately entered the base carrying oil barrels and explosives.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The convoy moved away quickly. Then, a raging fire had already broken out at the base, followed by loud explosions one after another.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, the entire secret base collapsed and turned into complete ruins.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alice reported the details of Shadow's raid on the Red Umbrella Group's secret base to Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, Shadow sent over all the research data he had collected at the base, as long as it was related to genetic modification.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alice frowned and said, "Mr. Hawthorne, I asked the group's scientific research experts to sort it out and found that Ashley was injected with an S-level genetic modification medicine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This medicine is the prototype of the third-level power elixir. It had not yet been fully developed and had a 100% mortality rate!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's face suddenly darkened, and he clenched his fists involuntarily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Where is Felix?"</span></p><div class="pagination">
