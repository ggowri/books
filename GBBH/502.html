  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a secluded valley of </span><span>Tikoferi</span><span>, Jerry, a battle-hardened man with a distinctive facial scar, stood commanding attention from an elevated platform. His eyes gleamed with anticipation as he addressed the crowd of armed mercenaries gathered below.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"By now, you've all seen the bounty," he called out, his voice echoing across the valley. "We're talking billions here. Take down a Red Umbrella executive? That's a cool ten million minimum. Hell, even eliminating a regular member will net you anywhere from fifty grand to half a million."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His scarred face broke into a fierce grin. "The process is simple - upload proof of elimination to the Dark Web, and within 24 hours, the money hits your account. Clean and straightforward."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Drawing himself up to his full height, Jerry's voice took on a steely edge. "This is the opportunity of a lifetime, and we're not going to miss it. Our target is clear: the local </span><span>Red Umbrella branch. And we won't stop until it's reduced to ashes!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cheers erupted from the crowd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is an amazing opportunity!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've waited for years, and now I finally have a chance to strike it rich!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The assassins were thrilled, laughing with delight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These more than 100 people belong to a secret killer organization in </span><span>Tikoferi</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jerry was one of the top 50 killers on the Dark Web list, and his strength was no weaker than William's.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had more than 100 killers. What a powerful force was that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, this secret killer organization was obviously not the only force that was greedy for the bounty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Merciful God! Thank you for your blessing. I finally have the opportunity to make a lot of money..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the desert, a bearded chief wearing a turban knelt on the ground and prayed devoutly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After praying, he stood up, waving his AK47, and started roaring, "Rush to the Red Umbrella Group branch and destroy them!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hurry up, time is money!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Behind him, there were hundreds of soldiers wearing ragged clothes or even barefoot, cheering and waving broken AK47s and rocket launchers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In addition to the killer organizations and terrorists, the entire gangster circle was shocked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A turbulent and terrifying undercurrent was surging, and almost all gangs targeted the Red Umbrella Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even SATAN, the Godfather of the Mafia, could not control his restless subordinates and began to attack the people of the Red Umbrella Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"These bastards actually dared to ignore my orders! The person with such a large reward must be either that old man or Alexander."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>SATAN gnashed his teeth in anger. His ugly old face covered with scars was distorted, like a real devil from hell.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander offered a reward of tens of billions of dollars on the Dark Web, and the whole world went crazy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Whether they were killers, terrorists, gangsters, thieves, or drug addicts, along with countless strongmen and warriors, at this moment, they seemed to transform into greedy wolves, crazily flocking to the branches of the Red Umbrella Group in various states and cities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In </span><span>Kingsdon</span><span>, above the Red Umbrella Group headquarters, the sky was full of dark clouds, and the murderous aura was invisible but tangible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A flash of lightning streaked across the sky, and the heavy rain began to fall as if the sky was crying for the Red Umbrella Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It must be Alexander who is behind this... The old bastard is also involved. Damn it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix was so anxious and trembling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even around the headquarters of the Red Umbrella Group, there were countless killers hiding, and dangers were lurking on every side.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A bodyguard stumbled in to report, "Mr. Vanderbilt, something happened! Mr. Parker just walked out of the company gate...and got killed!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Asshole! Didn't I tell you that no one is allowed to go out?" Felix roared, feeling heartbroken.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Dave's research team died out, Patton Parker became the best candidate to succeed Dave. But now he died under unclear circumstances just after he started working.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, this was just the beginning, as bad news came one after another.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Vanderbilt, most of the staff have run away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Someone cut off the water and electricity. They want to surround us and starve us to death."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix was so angry that he grabbed the precious vase on the table and smashed it to the ground, breaking it into pieces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is too much! Immediately ask the military for help and ask them to send reinforcements!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Recall all metahumans in the group. That bastard Alexander will definitely come to </span><span>Kingsdon</span><span>. We must not let him go.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What are you still standing there for? Stupid! Do it now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix's angry roar echoed.</span></p><div class="pagination">
