  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Still, Wyatt had to admit Alexander was really strong.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eugene urged impatiently, "Dad, hurry up and teach him a lesson!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had seen his dad punch right through a wall before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That kind of terrifying power wasn't something a regular person could match. The Blood Gang's success today was largely thanks to Wyatt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wyatt took a few steps forward, cracking his knuckles as he approached Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kid, don't think a little skill makes you untouchable. To me, you're just a joke."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing their boss about to act, the crowd got all hyped up, as if pumped with adrenaline.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dad, let me slap him hard!" Eugene shouted excitedly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wyatt nodded. "You'll get to slap him a hundred times soon enough."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was speechless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You guys talk too much. If you're going to fight, get on with it. If not, get out of </span><span>Loscity</span><span>!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mary couldn't help but laugh. Alexander was aggravating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wyatt's expression grew darker.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Arrogant!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He suddenly leaped forward, appearing right in front of Alexander, swinging a heavy punch directly at his head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The punch was powerful, and the speed was at its peak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is that it? Get lost!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander threw his own punch, meeting Wyatt's fist head-on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bang!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What happened next shocked everyone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wyatt was sent flying backward, spitting out blood mid-air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander had defeated Wyatt with just one move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Silence fell; only the sound of heavy breathing could be heard as everyone stared at Alexander in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eugene was stunned, frozen in place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had always thought his dad was unbeatable, yet he'd been defeated in a single move. What was going on?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wyatt himself was the most shocked. When his fist collided with Alexander's, no one could have known the turmoil it caused inside him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had put all his power into that punch, strength surpassing a champion </span><span>boxer's</span><span>, yet it had been shattered so easily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clutching his broken right hand, Wyatt managed to choke out, "How... how did you do that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A confident smile spread across Alexander's face, exuding a commanding, powerful aura.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Blood Gang never should have sided with the mafia, and you shouldn't have messed with me. But now it's too late!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wyatt, both anxious and terrified, spat out another mouthful of blood and passed out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's cold gaze fell on Eugene.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You set up that trap for Mary, didn't you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eugene's face went pale, and he turned to run.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ouch!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a cry of pain, Alexander kicked him to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eugene quickly began begging for mercy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne, I'm sorry. I didn't know you and Mary were... involved. It wasn't intentional. I was pushed into it by that jerk Lawrence..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He crawled on his knees toward Mary, pleading.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mary, I swear I didn't know... really! This is all a misunderstanding... the Blood Gang has always treated you well...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I honestly didn't mean </span><span>it,</span><span> I didn't know anything. If I had meant to hurt you, may I die a horrible death and go to hell."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eugene's acting was convincing; he was begging, crying, and looked truly desperate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Eugene grovel like this, especially compared to his previous arrogance, Mary felt a wave of nausea, nearly gagging from disgust.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing that neither Mary nor Alexander had spoken, Eugene's eyes lit up, and he quickly got up and tried to run.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's cold voice rang out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Did I say you could leave?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eugene froze, slowly turning around, his face looking as if someone in his family had died.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Everyone, get down on your knees. If you don't, you'll die!" Alexander ordered sternly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not only Eugene but the other Blood Gang leaders also felt overwhelming pressure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thud! Thud!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone's knees went weak, and they dropped hard to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instantly, everyone was on edge, but they were secretly relieved that someone had managed to send a message to the police earlier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A top-tier gang reduced to relying on the police for protection. This was the biggest joke of all.</span></p><div class="pagination">
