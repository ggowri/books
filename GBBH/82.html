  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Augusta was the first to shed his pants, revealing the old scar on his knee.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A jagged line ran from his thigh down to just below his kneecap, a testament to the brutal injury he had endured.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The larger pieces of shrapnel had been removed, but a few tiny fragments were still lodged dangerously close to the nerves in his knee.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If those shards were disturbed, they could damage the nerves and render his leg useless&mdash;a risk even the best specialists were unwilling to take.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander hadn't prepared any anesthetics; instead, he instructed Billy to bring over the magic powder.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He said, "Augusta, this magic powder works better than regular anesthetics. But since it's an old injury, removing the shrapnel might still sting a bit. Just bear with it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Boss, this magic powder is incredible! I feel great all over. Just do what you need to do; I can handle it," Augusta replied, a grin spreading across his face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nodding, Alexander used Force Sense to pinpoint the tiny pieces of shrapnel before picking up the prepared needle.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As he slowly inserted it, the Force coalesced around the needle, emitting a faint white glow. The others watched in awe, their respect for Alexander growing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Though the needle pricked his skin, Augusta only furrowed his brow, silently enduring the discomfort.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander felt a surge of satisfaction; a strong will often equated to a strong fighter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With a swift motion, he withdrew the needle, revealing a tiny piece of shrapnel the size of a sesame seed stuck to its tip.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was astonishing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander continued, extracting three small fragments in total, each one a testament to his skill.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Ah! That feels so good..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Augusta's eyes lit up, joy radiating from his face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The persistent ache in his knee faded, replaced by a sense of lightness he hadn't felt in ages.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Unable to contain himself, he flexed his leg, excitement bubbling over.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Boss, how did you do that? I feel like I'm already healed! This is unbelievable!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander cautioned with a smile, "Easy there! No need to rush. You'll need to rest for at least three days before you can start pushing it again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"And while you're going to feel a lot better, don't expect a full return to normal just yet. But getting to eighty or ninety percent is a solid win."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'm already more than satisfied with that. Thank you, boss," Augusta said in gratitude.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Apart from the simple words of thanks, this former soldier didn't know how else to express his appreciation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The other three men, who had been somewhat anxious, now looked at Augusta with renewed hope, their anticipation for their own treatments ignited.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'll take a look at your injuries next," Alexander said, moving to assess them individually.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Each of their wounds varied in severity. Logan had a shoulder injury, Marvin had a wound in his abdomen, and Charlize had a hurt back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Charlize's injury was relatively minor, but the others were serious. The cumulative effects of their untreated injuries left them in a precarious state.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Marvin's situation was the worst; he had developed necrosis in his abdomen due to a piece of shrapnel that couldn't be removed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">No wonder Charlize teased him about not lasting more than two minutes in bed. Such injuries would definitely take a toll.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"This area is particularly sensitive due to the nerve endings. If it weren't for the Force, I wouldn't dare to treat it," Alexander thought, assessing the situation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Don't worry! Your injuries may look severe, but they're all treatable, and you can fully recover," Alexander reassured them confidently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Really? I can fully recover?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Marvin's face flushed with excitement.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He had thought he'd be stuck like this for life, so hearing Alexander's promise filled him with hope.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Absolutely!" Alexander confirmed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Marvin's gratitude was palpable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander chuckled. "Just so you know, this area is pretty sensitive, so it might sting a bit."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Marvin thumped his chest confidently. "Don't worry, boss. Just go ahead and treat me. If I even make a sound, I'm not a man."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander nodded and got to work, treating each one of them carefully.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Hours later, Alexander was drenched in sweat but finally allowed himself a satisfied smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Continuous treatment was no easy task, and he'd need some serious meditation to restore his Force.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Thank you, boss!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Augusta and the others expressed their gratitude profusely. They were deeply appreciative but were at a loss for how to repay him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If Alexander asked them to take on any task, even something as extreme as taking lives, they would do it without hesitation.</p><div class="pagination">
