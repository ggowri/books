  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander carefully examined the </span><span>dead</span><span> man's corpse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He found a strange box on the body that could emit various sounds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man's body had undergone severe mutations. His bones and muscles had twisted into forms that barely resembled anything human.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's Enhanced vision revealed a uniquely shaped chip embedded in </span><span>his</span><span> scalp.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was clear now. Someone was controlling this person, and that box's signal could command the mutated beasts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The revelation left everyone speechless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander frowned deeply. The Sakra Society was growing more powerful by the day.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That old bastard Yinson hadn't just created zombies and living dead. He'd found a way to mutate wild animals too. The Immortality Serum was more terrifying than they'd imagined.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne, are you hurt?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A familiar female voice called out, filled with concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander didn't need to turn around to recognize Norah's voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm fine, Ms. Chapman. Thank you for asking."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Norah circled Alexander, checking him for injuries. Though he was covered in the mutant beasts' blood, she was both amazed and relieved to find him completely unharmed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She never imagined Alexander could be this powerful. He was practically superhuman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stand back! Drop your weapons! Nobody leaves without military authorization!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sudden shouts broke through the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander turned to see over a thousand heavily armed soldiers surrounding the Louvian Port survivors, ordering them to disarm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under the military's threats, everyone had no choice but to surrender their weapons. They were loaded onto trucks like prisoners.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What the hell do you think you're doing?" Karson demanded furiously. "You can't just arrest us! Where are you taking us?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd joined in, rallying behind Karson's protests.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shut up!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The commanding officer kicked Karson hard and shouted, "Military command ordered us to put you all in quarantine to prevent infection spread."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Karson tried to resist, the officer jammed his gun against his forehead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"One more word out of you, old man, and I'll blow your brains out right here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a flash, Alexander's boot connected with the officer's chest, sending him flying several yards before he crashed to the ground. His gun went spinning off somewhere in the chaos.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instantly, dozens of rifle barrels snapped toward Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Alexander had already grabbed the officer with lightning speed, using him as a human shield.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Did General Thompson give you these orders?" Alexander's voice was ice-cold. "To lock up innocent civilians?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The officer trembled as he answered Alexander's deadly serious question.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It wasn't Quentin... it was... it was direct orders from military command," he stammered. "They said it's to prevent the spread..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's expression turned frighteningly dark. "Military command? Contact General Thompson right now. I need answers."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The officer didn't dare refuse. His shaking hands fumbled with the satellite phone to call Quentin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once connected, Alexander quickly briefed Quentin on the situation, demanding to know why they were rounding up survivors instead of hunting down the Sakra Society.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Man..." A deep sigh came through the phone from Quentin. "Alexander, I just got word that Yinson has joined the Ghost. Some big shot pulled strings to get him in..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?" Alexander was floored by the news.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Ghost wasn't just any club. It was the most elite organization on the planet, the real puppet masters behind human society. The fact that Yinson had managed to get in was mind-blowing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"With the Immortality Serum, Yinson's got his hooks in a lot of powerful people now," Quentin said gravely. "There's no stopping his rise to power. I'll order them to leave the survivors alone, but everything's about to change. You should head to Treasure Island as soon as possible."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After they talked a bit more, Alexander handed the satellite phone back to the military officer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Following Quentin's direct order to release the survivors, the officer had no choice but to comply, even if he didn't like it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Norah could hardly believe it. Alexander had come through for everyone again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She couldn't help herself. She ran to him and threw her arms around him in a tight embrace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander felt awkward about such a public display of affection, but he couldn't help being touched by Norah's genuine warmth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He patted her back gently and said, "It's okay now, everything's fine. You and your dad should get out of Louvian Port. If you're interested, there's room for you on Treasure Island."</span></p><div class="pagination">
