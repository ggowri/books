  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Huh?&nbsp;After stepping through the glowing entrance, Alexander found himself in a long corridor lined with small rooms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A servant opened one of the doors, revealing a lavishly decorated room. In the center stood a grand rosewood table, complete with a full tea set and a small booklet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One wall of the room was made entirely of transparent glass panels, shimmering with faint rainbow hues.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking through the glass, he realized he was on the second floor, overlooking a vast hall hundreds of meters wide. Rows upon rows of rosewood chairs filled the space, already occupied by many attendees. At the front stood a raised platform, where a square table and three grand armchairs had been placed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The servant quietly closed the door and left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Knock, knock.&nbsp;A moment later, someone rapped on the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander opened the door and was immediately taken aback. A stunning young woman stood before him, her alluring eyes filled with warmth. Dressed as a maid, she wore a pink low-cut gown that accentuated her curvy, graceful figure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The young woman bowed slightly, her voice as soft as a whispering orchid. "Sir, my name is Sonya Keach. I am in charge of this VIP room for the auction."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Money really does make a difference.&nbsp;Alexander nodded slightly. "Alright, come in."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Alexander enjoyed the luxury of a beautiful woman pouring his tea and speaking to him in soft tones, the people below were shifting uncomfortably in their hard wooden chairs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Half an hour later, another knock came at the door. Sonya opened it, and a scholarly-looking man entered, carrying an iron box. He placed it respectfully on the table and said, "Sir, the total sale of your jewelry and jade amounts to 586,300 gold coins. Here are your gold notes, each worth 1,000 coins."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He then pulled out a brass token from his robe and handed it to Alexander. "Sir, this is a VIP token recognized by both the Hrodvik Business Alliance and the Hrodvik Treasury. With this, you are eligible to participate in all our auctions, and you will receive a 10% discount on all purchases."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Not bad, not bad. I appreciate it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander accepted the token and stored it away. If he exchanged his 500,000 gold coins for silver, that would be over five million in silver coins. If converted to martial virtue points, it would amount to over two million.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A pleased smile spread across his face. He opened the iron box, pulled out a 1,000-gold note, and handed it to the scholar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The scholar bowed, repeatedly expressing his gratitude as he backed out of the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sonya's eyes sparkled. She became even more attentive, playfully pouting and leaning in to massage Alexander's shoulders and arms. It sent a tingling sensation through him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Huh?&nbsp;A powerful aura suddenly filled the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was already nearing the peak of a level-four warrior. Could this be the presence of a level-five warrior?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Four more people had appeared on the platform. Three of them took their seats in the grand armchairs, drawing Alexander's astonished gaze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Business Alliance and the Hrodvik Treasury aren't just powerful. They have three level-five warriors present."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A plain-looking old man in black stood on the stage. When he spoke, his voice boomed like a thunderous bell.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The auction rules remain unchanged. Each item has a base price. Martial virtue points follow the same exchange rate as the Dominion Church&mdash;one point equals twenty silver coins. You may bid using gold or silver. If you do not have enough on hand, you may offer collateral of equivalent value, subject to appraisal. The highest bid wins."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ahem...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The old man cleared his throat and loudly announced, "The auction begins! The first item is the&nbsp;Cold Jade Saber, crafted by Koa using a blend of thousand-year cold iron and millennium ice jade. It took three years and one month to forge. This weapon is especially suited for ice-based techniques and can cut through hair without resistance. The starting price is 100,000 silver coins!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not a bad blade.&nbsp;If sold at the Treasure House, it would likely be priced at 100,000 silver coins, plus 10,000 martial virtue points&mdash;making its total value around 300,000 silver coins.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As expected, the moment the base price was announced, four or five bidders immediately jumped in, eager to claim the weapon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a few rounds of bidding, the price of the&nbsp;Cold Jade Saber&nbsp;had risen to 450,000 silver coins.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Some bidders gave up, and in the end, it was sold for 450,000 silver coins!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander pondered.&nbsp;"The Dominion Church's Treasure House really is a good place&mdash;cheaper than outside markets. This is the difference between having a powerful backing and not having one."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A lean middle-aged man stepped onto the stage, completed the payment, and left with the&nbsp;Cold Jade Saber, looking pleased. Meanwhile, the unsuccessful bidders were filled with frustration and resentment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The auction continued with two more weapons and a martial arts manual, all of which attracted fierce competition and fetched high prices.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The old man in black scanned the crowd and said in a deep voice, "The fifth auction item is something everyone dreams of, which is a divine's relic!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
