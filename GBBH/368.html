  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This wasn't just a simple situation; the Porsche surged with terrifying power, going from several hundred horsepower to over a thousand instantly, hitting top speed immediately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bang!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Porsche slammed hard into the rear corner of the Lamborghini.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Byron was sneering with smug satisfaction, having no idea that Porsche would </span><span>suddenly slam into him so fiercely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The forceful collision sent the Lamborghini flying, rolling several times and scraping against the guardrails with sparks flying before finally skidding to a stop several dozen miles away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thanks to Alexander's Force protection, the Porsche only had a slight dent in the front and was otherwise untouched.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Lamborghini's airbags had fully deployed. While Byron wasn't seriously injured, his face was bloodied as he let out a horrified scream.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander pulled the Porsche to a stop beside him. He rolled down the window, gave Byron the middle finger, and drove off, completely unbothered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the Porsche roared away, it left a blast of foul-smelling exhaust, causing Byron to curse out loud.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You bastard! You crash into my car and flip me off... you're dead!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Byron struggled out of his seat, cursing as he crawled out of the car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His newly bought Lamborghini was completely wrecked, totaled by the impact.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A car worth over ten million, gone just like that, and he'd had it for less than a month.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it, that bastard!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Byron's heart bled as his rage skyrocketed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Rebecca, you brat! You crash my car and run? Ralph's about to die anyway. Let's see how far you get!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Byron called up a group of Hansen family members, then set off in hot pursuit toward the Hansen Villa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the car, Rebecca was thrilled, still buzzing from that massive crash.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, you're incredible! You sent that jerk flying. He deserved it! I can't stop laughing!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smiled slightly. "People like him need to be taught a lesson."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was Rebecca's first experience with a collision like that, and she couldn't contain her excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The guy had wanted to force her into marriage, yet now he'd been sent flying. Just thinking about it melted away her accumulated frustrations like snow meeting fire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Vroom, vroom..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sound of a powerful engine came from behind. Rebecca glanced back in surprise, her expression changing instantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He just won't quit. He's chasing us again!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander glanced in the rearview mirror, then smiled calmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He's not satisfied? Guess he's got a death wish. He can't catch us."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Can't catch us?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing the Ferrari getting closer in the mirror, along with a large convoy, Rebecca looked worried.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander just smiled silently. From the next corner on, the road was full of sharp curves. It's not like a straight stretch where more horsepower gives the advantage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Straight-line races depended on a car's acceleration, but curves were a whole different game, relying on the driver's skill.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Besides, Alexander's Force and All-seeing Eyes could make all the difference in </span><span>critical moments.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander floored the gas pedal, and the Porsche took off at full speed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Porsche sped ahead, with a Ferrari leading a huge convoy behind it, chasing like a crazed pack of animals and staying on their tail.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander kept his All-seeing Eyes activated, reading every detail of the road and the performance of both cars as the information streamed into his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His powerful mental abilities acted like a supercomputer, instantly calculating the best route for him through the turns and making it harder for the Ferrari to keep up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Porsche quickly approached the first sharp turn, and Alexander didn't even hit the brakes, continuing to accelerate as he sharply turned the wheel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This idiot's got a death wish!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Byron saw the Porsche speeding into the curve without slowing down and sneered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This had to be suicide; there was no way he wouldn't go off the road into one of those ditches.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under Alexander's control, the Porsche's rear swung out in a perfect arc, with the tires scraping against the road and filling the air with the stench of burnt rubber.</span></p><div class="pagination">
