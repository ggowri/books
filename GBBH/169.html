  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava, having practiced yoga regularly, had a stunning figure&mdash;her butt was not only soft but also delightfully firm to the touch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey, I know you're feeling a bit pent up. Just hang in there; it'll be another day until Aunt Flo is completely gone..." she said, her cheeks flushing as she tried to comfort Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feeling a bit embarrassed, Alexander realized that during this time, he hadn't been pent up at all; in fact, he felt quite the opposite&mdash;happy and content.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That night, they fell asleep wrapped in each other's arms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With such a beautiful woman beside him, Alexander felt this was the happiest and most fulfilling time of his life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, at the Hilton Hotel in </span><span>Loscity</span><span>, the Kaylon had rented out the largest conference hall for an auction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The event was set up as a buffet lunch, featuring mainly jewelry and some antique artifacts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wealthy elites mingled in groups, toasting and chatting animatedly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava, in a sleek black backless evening gown that accentuated her lovely figure and showcased a deep neckline, was the center of attention.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She exuded both sexiness and grace, making her the star of the show since the Saint Group had become the general distributor of magic powder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Within minutes, several dapper gentlemen approached her, eager to strike up conversations.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava maintained a polite smile and handled their advances gracefully, but inside, she felt a bit irritated. She didn't want Alexander to misunderstand her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wait, where did he run off to?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava suddenly realized Alexander was missing. They had come together, after all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander appeared, balancing two large plates piled high with food, a big grin on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ava, you've got to try this! Are you hungry?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava couldn't help but laugh. Though it was a buffet, most guests sampled just a little to maintain their gentlemanly decorum, but here was Alexander, diving in like there was no tomorrow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't think it was embarrassing at all; instead, she found his carefree nature adorable and refreshingly genuine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wow, you've got quite the appetite! Go ahead, enjoy it," Ava said with a warm smile, encouraging him to sit down and dig in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander didn't care about the etiquette. Coming from a rough background and having been bullied by the Fairfax family, he had never experienced such an upscale luncheon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The array of gourmet dishes was a feast for the senses&mdash;every delicacy from land and sea was laid out before him, and the wines were all top-shelf, boasting impressive vintages.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He settled in, unabashedly indulging, and soon, a mountain of empty plates began to pile up in front of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander even polished off half a bottle of red wine, enjoying himself thoroughly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he feasted, several guests whispered among themselves, casting judgmental glances.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Can you believe this guy? He's so rude! Isn't Ava going to do something about him? This is so embarrassing!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Seriously, he's drinking red wine like it's water. That's meant to be savored, not gulped down. What a hick."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sure, he's the brains behind magic powder, but he's just so uncouth. His background is a real liability."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their hushed comments were laced with disdain, but Alexander, with his keen hearing as a Warrior, caught every word.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He merely smirked, unfazed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What did social graces or pedigree matter in the face of true strength?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These snobs could whisper all they wanted, but they dared not speak loudly enough for him to confront them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Offending Alexander could jeopardize their families' access to magic powder sales, and that was a risk they couldn't afford.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava seemed to catch wind of their chatter, too. She frowned slightly but then poured Alexander another glass of wine, her demeanor warm and caring, like a devoted wife looking after her husband.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sir Hansen is here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sudden exclamation drew everyone's attention, immediately shifting the atmosphere in the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lara</span><span>, dressed to the nines, elegantly supported a vibrant, silver-haired elder as they made their way through the crowd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Behind them trailed Orion, keeping a respectful distance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Orion spotted Alexander, his expression darkened, as if Alexander owed him a hefty sum of money.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sir Hansen must be over eighty this year. When he's gone, who will take over the title of head of the Hansen family? Will it be </span><span>Lara</span><span> or Orion?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If Sir Hansen passes, I bet </span><span>Lara</span><span> and Orion will go head-to-head for that position. It'll be a fierce battle, no doubt."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Whispers filled the air, a mix of curiosity and speculation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Among the crowd, several single men watched </span><span>Lara</span><span> with keen interest. Marrying her could mean gaining control of the Hansen family's enormous fortune&mdash;worth billions&mdash;a golden ticket to success.</span></p><div class="pagination">
