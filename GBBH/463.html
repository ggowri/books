  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nate Sullivan's eyes went wide, his voice dripping with jealousy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ava, you've got a boyfriend now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava smiled, leaning over to plant a kiss on Alexander's cheek.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's right. He's my boyfriend&mdash;Alexander."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nate's face twisted, and his tone turned sarcastic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, huh? What makes you think you deserve to be Ava's boyfriend?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander shot him a disinterested glance. This guy was way too full of himself. That condescending tone really grated on his nerves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But before Alexander could say anything, Ava's temper flared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Nate, what's that supposed to mean? Who do you think you are, belittling my boyfriend?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since Nate had it out for Alexander, Ava wasn't about to be nice to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nate snorted, "Ava, I'm just saying this for your own good. This guy does not worthy of you. You deserve someone who's young, successful, and going places."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander couldn't help but laugh, "Not worthy of her, huh? And you think you are? You're being ridiculous."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who are you calling ridiculous?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nate stepped up to Alexander, fists clenching, ready for a fight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Move it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander gave him a slight shove, and Nate stumbled back, nearly losing his balance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You just shoved me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nate's face turned red with rage, and he aimed a vicious kick at Alexander's groin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a dirty move&mdash;if it landed, Alexander would be seriously hurt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's patience ran out. This guy wasn't just obnoxious&mdash;he was dangerous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Smack!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sound of a slap echoed through the gym.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's hand moved quicker than Nate could react, landing a sharp slap across his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nate let out a yelp, falling to the ground as he clutched his now swollen cheek.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava shook her head, sighing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Nate, you're just like you were in college&mdash;always looking down on everyone. You've really got issues."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander wrapped an arm around Ava, ready to leave, but Nate wasn't done yet. He stepped forward, blocking their way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What now? You want another beating?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's tone was casual, almost amused.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nate gritted his teeth. As a former college athlete and now a well-known fitness coach, he refused to believe Alexander had actually beaten him fair and square.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Listen, Alexander. Unlike you, I'm not one to throw punches in front of a lady&mdash;it's not what a gentleman does.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But if you've got the guts, let's see what you're made of. There are barbells right here. The loser leaves, and the winner gets to take Ava out. You in?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nate's eyes were filled with confidence as he glared at Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander scoffed, "You're delusional. Why should I compete just because you say so? Ava's not some prize to be won."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava's face twisted in disgust as she shot Nate a cold glare.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nate's expression darkened, anger bubbling beneath the surface.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Son of bitch! If you beat me, I swear I'll never bother you again. But if you lose, you leave the hotel right now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And if you're too scared to compete, then you're nothing but a coward."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander didn't see any point in wasting more time on Nate. He turned, ready to leave with Ava.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, Ava grabbed his arm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He's gone too far, treating me like I'm some trophy. Compete with him, and make sure you win. Bet that he'll never show his face around us again."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Ava so worked up, clearly furious, Alexander decided to go along with it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, I'll take him on. But how are you </span><span>gonna</span><span> thank me after I win? Maybe something like... being mine forever?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ugh, you're impossible!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava's face turned a bright shade of red at Alexander's teasing, and she leaned into his chest, giving him a playful shove.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, with Ava pressed up against him, Alexander couldn't help but let his hands wander, enjoying the moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nate's eyes nearly popped out of his head, seeing Alexander touch Ava so casually and Ava enjoying it. He snapped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Cut it out! Alexander, how dare you act like that in public! It's too much."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava sneered at him, "Alexander's my boyfriend. If I want to be with him, that's none of your business. You and me? We're just classmates&mdash;nothing more."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nate wasn't giving up, his voice rising in desperation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ava, I chased you for three whole years, and I've got money! If you'd be with me, I'd give you 100 grand a month&mdash;how's that sound?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava rolled her eyes. "100 grand dollars a month? Seriously, you think that's a lot?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nate completely misunderstood, his face lighting up with hope.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Exactly! If you're with me, 100 grand dollars every month. That's over a million dollars a year!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
