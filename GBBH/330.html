  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Madison had been whispering to the bald man for quite a while, and it was clear her words weren't kind.</span><span> </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander shot the bald man a cold look. "You're Mr. Johnson from the City of Sorcery, right? Scott Thompson is in grave danger. If the witchcraft insects inside him aren't removed soon, he might not make it through the next hour."</span><span> </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What? Witchcraft insects? That's impossible! You must be mistaken!" The bald man was visibly shocked.</span><span> </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd erupted in murmurs, eyes filled with surprise and suspicion as they turned to Alexander.</span><span> </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you sure it's witchcraft insects? I would have noticed them immediately if they were there. It can't be true..." the bald man muttered, his expression shifting.</span><span> </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Madison pointed at Alexander and accused, "You're a fraud! Witchcraft insects? My uncle is a wizard, and he hasn't found anything. You're just trying to deceive people with your talk of sorcery."</span><span> </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander shook his head dismissively. "Your uncle is only at the gray robe level. These insects are very elusive; only a black robe level wizard can detect them, and only a white wizard can remove them."</span><span> </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone was taken aback; white wizards were as rare as city lords in the City of Sorcery. Alexander's claim seemed outlandish.</span><span> </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The bald man glared at Alexander with a sinister smile. "I'm just a gray robe, but I'm not easily fooled. How about a bet? If you can cure Scott Thompson, I'll apologize publicly. But if you can't, you'll admit your mistake and leave. Do you dare?"</span><span> </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander agreed readily. "Alright, but remember, this was your idea."</span><span> </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without wasting time, he placed his hands on Scott and began channeling the Force for healing.</span><span> </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A massive surge of Force rushed into Scott's mind. Suddenly, Scott convulsed violently, his face twisted in pain. The monitoring equipment nearby went haywire, the heart rate graph spiking wildly before stabilizing.</span><span> </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it! He's in critical condition!" Doctors rushed over, trying to save Scott, but Alexander held them back.</span><span> </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop! Alexander, what are you doing?" Quentin shouted in panic.</span><span> </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brittany and the others tried to intervene, but Alexander pushed them away effortlessly.</span><span> </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adam and Madison started to laugh smugly. "I knew he was a fraud; you all fell for it."</span><span> </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brittany, worried for her brother, ignored their taunts. "Alexander, if you harm my brother, I'll never forgive you!"</span><span> </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander remained focused, using the Force to heal. The Force wrapped around the strange black energy, dissolving it quickly. Soon, Scott calmed down, his breathing and heart rate returning to normal.</span><span> </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quentin and Brittany finally relaxed.</span><span> </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The doctors, witnessing this, were astonished; Alexander's abilities seemed supernatural, far beyond conventional medicine. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The room was silent, everyone hoping for a miracle.</span><span> </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Madison remained unconvinced, ready to continue her criticism.</span><span> </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, Scott opened his eyes and slowly sat up. Adam was speechless, like a duck caught by the neck.</span><span> </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd erupted in joy.</span><span> </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Thompson, don't move yet; I'll check your vitals," an elderly expert said, gently examining Scott. Soon, the instrument's screen showed a series of normal physiological indicators.</span><span> </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Everything's normal!"</span><span> </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd was amazed, then burst into applause. No one had expected Alexander to save Scott, who had been in critical danger moments ago. It seemed miraculous.</span><span> </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quentin rushed over, embracing his grandson with tears streaming down his face.</span><span> </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brittany comforted her grandfather, tears in her eyes. "Don't cry, Grandpa. Scott is alright, he's fine..."</span><span> </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Alexander had more to say. "The witchcraft insects in Scott's body have been severely weakened, but removing them completely isn't simple."</span></p><div class="pagination">
