Her clothes were quickly stripped off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing </span><span>Cloe</span><span>'s alluring body, Alexander didn't hesitate to pin her beneath him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At </span><span>Loscity</span><span> square, a massive music festival was in full swing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The massive event had drawn tens of thousands&mdash;locals mixed with out-of-towners, all gathering to see an impressive lineup of bands and artists.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The headliners were some of the biggest names in music, real crowd favorites that had everyone buzzing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even blocks away from the square, the streets were packed with people flowing toward the venue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Couples were everywhere, holding hands and cuddling as they made their way to the stage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Families strolled by with huge grins, clearly making a day of it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Singles moved through the crowd, too, all headed for the main event.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Show's about to start! We can't miss this&mdash;it's </span><span>gonna</span><span> be epic!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"For real. The crowd's looking good tonight. So many cute people here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank god we got here early. Can you imagine being stuck watching the screens in the back?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey, did you guys hear? Sienna Rhodes from the </span><span>Newbrook</span><span> music family is performing tonight!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No way! Her violin skills are absolutely insane."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sienna's coming? That's lit!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander stood in the middle of it all, surrounded by the excited chatter of the crowd around the stage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander couldn't care less about this so-called music goddess, Sienna.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ashley had wanted to check out the backstage area, so Ava took her on a little tour.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He'd video chatted with Ava earlier, and seeing Ashley having such a blast had put him in a great mood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, the sound of a violin from the stage snapped him out of his thoughts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wait, is that Ashley?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander did a double take when he spotted his daughter on stage, curiously plucking at a violin that had been left there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava quickly caught up, giving Ashley a warm hug as she guided her away from the instrument.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop right there! Who said you could touch that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A woman's angry shout rang out, making Ashley jump. She quickly ducked behind Ava, scared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's face darkened into a frown. What happened?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sure, his daughter had touched the violin, but it's not like she'd damaged it. This woman was being way over the top.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander shoved his way through the crowd, sending people stumbling left and right as he made his way to the stage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Several feet above the crowd, angry voices erupted from the stage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who the hell do you think you are? Have you got any idea who this violin is reserved for? Nobody gave you permission to mess with it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This violin is meant for Ms. Rhodes only. Think you can afford to replace it if you break it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ugh, who does this woman think she is? Just because you're pretty and have a kid with you doesn't mean you can do whatever you want!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A group of women surrounded Ava, their insults pouring out like a toxic stream, each one nastier than the last.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava pushed Ashley behind her protectively, glaring at the women with mounting anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's your problem? We barely touched it. You seriously think that would break it? You're just looking for trouble, and I'm not going to let you intimidate me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though Ava stood her ground, she was seriously outnumbered. Her defiance only seemed to make them more aggressive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Women, when they gang up on another woman, could be even more vicious than men.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, so you're talking back to us now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Ava could react, one of the heavy-set women, her face twisted with rage, suddenly swung her hand toward Ava's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luckily, Ava jerked back just in time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The heavy-set woman's attack was like lighting a match to gasoline. In seconds, a pack of women surrounded Ava, shoving her back and forth while Ashley wailed in terror.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander had already made it to the floor level, but a wall of security guards blocked his path. His blood boiled as he watched the women start to get physical.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get out of my way!" he roared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The burly security guards hit the ground hard, struggling to get back on their feet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Alexander was about to storm the stage, a young woman in a white gown rushed over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What is going on here?" she demanded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sienna! Thank </span><span>god</span><span> you're here!" The women spun around, talking over each other. "This crazy woman deliberately broke your violin. Can you believe the nerve?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, we're just teaching her a lesson she won't forget."</span></p><div class="pagination">
