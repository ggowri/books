  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Die, worthless scum!" Stephen hissed as he swung his blade with deadly precision.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brock's hand shot up, instinctively raising his machete to block the blow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was a sickening crack as the axe shattered like glass, and before Brock could even react, his head was severed in an instant, flying through the air to roll lifelessly on the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A look of disbelief and terror froze on Brock's face. His mind couldn't grasp the speed of the strike.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But in that moment, none of it mattered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the blink of an eye, darkness swallowed him whole.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Less than five minutes after Brock and his men stormed into the restaurant, the infamous fighter and his loyal followers lay dead, their bodies sprawled across the floor, their heads removed in a single swift motion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blood poured from the fallen like a river, soaking the floor in crimson, bodies twisted </span><span>and contorted in unnatural positions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The restaurant was deathly silent, save for the harsh, panicked breaths of Joaquin and his crew, whose eyes were wide with shock. They stared at the mangled remains, their stomachs churning with disgust, one of them barely managing to keep his lunch down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stephen stood over the carnage, wiping his saber on one of the fallen bodies, his face calm as he slid the blade back into its sheath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the blood was wiped clean, the blade's intricate chrysanthemum pattern gleamed faintly, its beauty enhanced by the dark red stains that clung to it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you all just going to stand there? Clean this mess up!" Stephen growled, annoyance creeping into his voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, Sir!" Joaquin snapped out of his stupor and immediately turned to bark orders at his subordinates.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What the hell are you idiots doing? Get to work! You've got half an hour. If I see a single drop of blood left, I swear I'll have your heads!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instantly, the room erupted into frenzied action. The bodies were hastily shoved into burlap sacks and carried out back in a dump truck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They vacuumed up the blood, sprinkled powder to cover the stains, and scrubbed the floor furiously with cloths...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stephen, meanwhile, grinned darkly as he eyed the terrified figure cowering in the corner.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brianna was trembling, her head low, too scared to even glance at the monster who had just slaughtered everyone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stephen stalked over, grabbing her chin and forcing her to look up, his smirk growing colder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brianna's beauty, though evident, was overshadowed by the terror in her eyes. Her body trembled uncontrollably, fear making her soft curves quiver, her chest rising and falling in rapid, panicked breaths.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Please... don't kill me... I'll do anything... anything you want... just don't... please!" She could see the unmistakable glint of desire in Stephen's eyes and seized the opportunity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She even nervously cupped her chest with both hands, trembling as she presented it to Stephen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You slut!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stephen ripped her clothes open, and they immediately sprang free, eager to be exposed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He grabbed them roughly, squeezing with force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Red marks quickly appeared on her delicate skin. Brianna's face tightened in pain, and her brows furrowed deeply, but she remained still, too afraid to resist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come here and serve me properly. If you do a good job, I might let you live."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stephen grabbed her and pulled her closer, then gave a subtle gesture towards his zipper.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brianna's heart raced with relief at the thought of survival. Eager to please, she quickly undid Stephen's pants, only to be met with a disgusting sight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A foul stench hit her immediately, almost making her gag.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She hadn't expected Stephen to be so neglectful of his hygiene. He clearly hadn't bathed in days, and the mix of sweat and other unpleasant odors was enough to turn her stomach.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stephen gave a cold snort, his gaze icy and full of menace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brianna was trembling with fear. Without thinking, she grabbed the disgusting thing and forced herself to swallow it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She held her breath, focusing all her attention as she moved her tongue, trying to make the best of the situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stephen let out a deep, satisfied breath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>None of the others, including Joaquin, dared to look his way. They might have been curious, but fear kept them from even glancing in his direction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They knew that angering him could easily cost them their lives, just like the gruesome display of severed heads in the back of the dump truck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get on your knees, bitch!" Stephen snarled as he shoved Brianna to the ground, forcing her to kneel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sound of tearing fabric filled the air as Stephen stripped Brianna down to nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that moment, every inch of her was laid bare before him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stephen let out a smug laugh, stepping behind Brianna, ready to thrust in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come on. Take me..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brianna turned to Stephen, her tone and expression dripping with flirtation.</span></p><div class="pagination">
