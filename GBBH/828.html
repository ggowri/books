  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The bold woman was Denise Hall, known for her flamboyance in college. She dated a new boyfriend every three months on average.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Today, her outfit, a low neckline, miniskirt, and heavy makeup, made her look more scandalous than ever.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander smirked. "Denise, I know you've liked Bobby for years. Why don't you just marry him? Don't let the chance slip away."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Shut up! Who asked for your opinion?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Knowing his mocking, Denise turned to Bobby, clinging to him coyly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Murray, could you let me work for your company? I'll listen to you in everything. Whatever you want, I'll do it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Oh? Anything? You said it, not me. Don't go back on your word."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He smiled and placed his hand brazenly on her hip, giving it a squeeze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Come to my company tomorrow and be my secretary. I'll pay you five thousand dollars a month."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Denise lit up with joy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Thank you, Mr. Murray! I promise I'll be the best secretary and serve you well!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Denise practically threw herself at him while Alexander chuckled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Bobby's paying you so much. You better make sure your service meets his expectations."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alice nearly spat out her drink, unable to suppress her laughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander's biting remarks drew laughter from the crowd, further irritating Bobby.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Bobby was even more upset. He'd just been slapped and hadn't settled the score yet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Bobby slammed his hand on the table and stood, glaring at Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You've got a real mouth on you, huh? I see what's going on here. You're just con artists, using the Saint Group's name to scam us!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alice's patience snapped. She was ready to show Bobby just how wrong he was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Just then, a stunning woman entered the room, clad in a crisp white blouse and pencil skirt. Her stylish appearance radiated confidence and poise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her bright eyes glimmered with a touch of arrogance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Sorry, everyone. I'm late."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Many men were stunned, staring blankly at the fashionable beauty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Meanwhile, some women scrutinized the beauty with envy and a critical eye, clearly showing some jealousy and skepticism.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This was Louise Reid, the former campus beauty who had captivated countless hearts during college.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Bobby's excitement was palpable. Louise was even more beautiful now, her figure more mature and alluring.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But when the group turned to Alexander, the atmosphere grew tense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Years ago, Alexander had harbored feelings for Louise, and their rumored romance had caused quite a stir.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Eventually, they went their separate ways, and Alexander married Jane, becoming the subject of ridicule.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander's expression darkened, his brows furrowing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone sensed the change in Alexander, and Bobby couldn't help but smirk triumphantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He knew Louise had dumped Alexander for being too poor, dealing him a heavy blow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As a result, Alexander, who had always been a good student, became deeply depressed and nearly failed to graduate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Craig, placing a comforting hand on Alexander's shoulder, said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Don't dwell on the past. You're married now, and you've got a stunning woman by your side. Life's good."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Thanks."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander looked at Craig with a hint of gratitude. His mood had become quite calm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He had long moved on from Louise, but her sudden appearance stirred old memories, both sweet and bitter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Those were the scars left by youth, joy, sorrow, sweetness. All of it would gradually fade away with time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Come sit here, Louise! I'm thrilled you could make it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Bobby was too excited to bother with Alexander and rushed forward, effectively blocking others from getting close to Louise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Thank you, Bobby. I heard you've come into money. I'm really happy for you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Louise said with a coquettish smile, her proud gaze sweeping around the room. When her eyes landed on Alexander, her expression suddenly turned awkward.</span></p><div class="pagination">
