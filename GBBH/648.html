  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alyssa asked nervously, "What's wrong? What happened just now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stanley took a deep breath and said, "Boss, our undercover agent in Paxton's place has been discovered and was killed..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alyssa frowned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Axe was facing tremendous pressure now, and her spies had also been discovered by the other side. Without the source of intelligence, they would lose their bearings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The vibe in the conference room was extremely solemn and depressing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When they first sent a spy to the Mafia, the Axe spent a lot of money to gain their </span><span>trust and even made him a small team leader.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this critical moment, his identity was exposed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Axe lost their ability to predict the Mafia's moves, which was undoubtedly a huge blow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Alyssa looked grim, she quickly regained her self-composure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, he's dead now, and we can't help with that. What we should do now is to brainstorm any possible ways to deal with them," she said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The top leaders of the Axe looked at each other helplessly, not knowing what to say.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The gang alliance headed by the Mafia had absolute predominance, leaving no room for the Axe to resist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The absolute gap in strength could be made up by strategy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The best thing they could do when dealing with the alliance was to cause some damage and wait for their annihilation, unless they gave up everything they strove to have and left the Mandale Town. However, no one was willing to surrender like a coward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The meeting room was completely silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a period of silence for about ten minutes, Alyssa lost her patience and was about to dismiss the meeting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stanley spoke again, "Boss, we need to estrange the gangs, preventing them from forming a solid alliance. Maybe it can't solve the crisis once for all, but we can at least slow the Mafia's plan."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alyssa nodded. "That's the most ideal situation. The question is&mdash;how should we do that? By giving up our benefits?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stanley began to illustrate his plan, "If they stick to each other, the only ending for us is to be eliminated. But apart from the Mafia, the other gangs target us for their own interests."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Malone paused for a second and continued,</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why don't we take the initiative to contact the Weaver Family, Southern Mining, and the Glory Association to bribe them with some profits so that they can achieve their goals without bleeding. I think they will agree."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing his analysis, they nodded and thought he made sense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After he finished speaking, everyone turned to look at Alyssa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without Alyssa's leadership, the Axe wouldn't be as powerful as today, so the final decision could only be made by her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, they had to take the initiative to give a part of the profits, which could be very big.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They didn't know what Alyssa's opinion was, but sacrificing their interests was the last thing they would like to do.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a momentary silence, Alyssa clenched her teeth and made up her mind. "Fine! This is the only way out now. As long as our gang still exists, there is hope. We will take the initiative to contact other gangs, sacrifice some of the benefits to them, and disintegrate their alliance."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We will take whatever we lose in the future!" she added.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alyssa never hesitated and always stayed calm and decisive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Axe was already on the verge of life and death and had been forced into a desperate situation. No matter how much property they had, it would be useless. The more property they possessed, the more likely they would become a target.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If all other gangs in Mandale Town became their enemies, they would all perish in a miserable way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one opposed her decision.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In fact, many of them breathed a sigh of relief since the Axe would at least survive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Alyssa looked at Stanley with sharp eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll leave this matter to you. My bottom line is to at least save half of our gem mines and interests in trade so that we can have a chance to rise in the future," she said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, boss." Stanley nodded solemnly with a very serious expression.</span></p><div class="pagination">
