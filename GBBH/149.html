I'll transfer it right away," Betty replied eagerly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Augusta, brimming with excitement, couldn't help but ask, "Boss, aren't you worried I might just take that 100 million and run?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander burst into laughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come on! It's just a drop in the bucket. You all will make way more with me. From today on, I'm bumping your salaries up to a million a year, and you'll also get a three percent cut of the magic powder profits."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The room fell silent for a moment, the weight of his words sinking in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A million-dollar salary was elite territory, and a three percent cut of the magic powder profits? That was mind-blowing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If the magic powder took off globally, profits would be in the billions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even a mere three percent could translate to hundreds of millions if not over a billion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Augusta was the first to react, his eyes wide with disbelief and gratitude.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, Marvin, Logan, Charlize, William, and even Betty </span><span>were</span><span> pledging their loyalty to Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Boss, we're with you for the long haul!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander felt a surge of satisfaction. He was proud of his team's response, and it gave him a sense of accomplishment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He then addressed the two teams of elite fighters, announcing, "From now on, everyone's salary is tripled!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cheers erupted throughout the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Betty watched Alexander with a mix of admiration and surprise. She hadn't expected him to be not only a skilled fighter but also a master at winning people over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the magic powder in play, Ultimate Alliance wouldn't have any money troubles, but Alexander's willingness to share the wealth would only boost everyone's morale and loyalty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was clear that Alexander was a man of vision.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The more capable, generous, and aloof he appeared, the more it drew Betty in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A flutter of excitement coursed through her, and she felt a rush of warmth, longing to leap into Alexander's arms and relive that electrifying moment they shared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the promise of financial rewards, both teams were more motivated than ever, throwing themselves into their training.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Marvin turned to William, a challenge glinting in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey, I heard you've got some skills. Want to see what you've got?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>William didn't hesitate. "Sure thing! You're from the Phantom Squad, and I'm a killer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We're practically destined to clash, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two men squared off, ready to spar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marvin, towering and muscular, moved like a fierce bear, his attacks powerful and relentless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>William, on the other hand, was leaner and much more agile, dodging Marvin's strikes like a nimble monkey while launching sharp counters.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd cheered as the two exchanged blows, the energy in the room electric.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, Alexander stepped between them, grabbing each by the arm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, that's enough! Just a friendly spar, no need to injure each other."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marvin and William struggled for a moment, but Alexander's grip was unyielding, like iron cuffs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Boss, you're something else!" William exclaimed, impressed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marvin, sounding like a petulant child, whined, "Okay, okay! Just let me go, Boss! Your grip is crushing my arm!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander chuckled and released them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they rubbed their sore arms, they looked at Alexander with newfound respect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They understood that he had their best interests at heart. With their skills so closely matched, a real fight could lead to serious injuries.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"William, you've got some serious moves. From now on, you're my buddy!" Marvin declared, pulling William into a hearty embrace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Augusta and Logan joined in, clapping William on the back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thanks, everyone! I really appreciate it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>William's face flushed with gratitude. As a lone wolf for so long, he hadn't felt this kind of brotherhood in ages, and it meant a lot to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander waved them off. "Don't mind me, keep training."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Immediately, Augusta and the others got back to work.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Betty, come here for a second. I need to talk to you," Alexander called, gesturing for </span><span>her to join him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Betty's heart raced with excitement as she swayed her hips, walking over with a confident strut. Marvin couldn't help but lick his lips, watching her approach.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He leaned toward Charlize, smirking. "Ms. Rowe has quite the figure. Think Boss is going to get a little cozy with her?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ugh! You really think Boss is like you? Gross!" Charlize shot back, rolling her eyes before storming off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marvin shrugged, wiping his face where she had spat at him and sniffing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was grinning like a fool. "What can I say? A beautiful woman is a beautiful woman. Even her spit smells good!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
