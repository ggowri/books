  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fiona squirmed slightly but made no real effort to push Oswald away when he held her tight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her face flushed with embarrassment. "What do you think you're doing? Let go of me this instant!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Oswald spoke with a stubborn determination, his grip unyielding, "I'm not letting go! Given the situation, we might both die anyway. Before that happens, I need to make sure I die with a woman by my side or I'll feel like I wasted my life."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get off me! I knew you weren't any good; always scheming to get into my pants," Fiona snapped, pushing at him with more force, though still not enough to free herself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ignoring her protests, Oswald pulled them both into the nearby container filled with supplies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a loud bang, he slammed the door shut and locked it securely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What... what are you planning?" Fiona's voice wavered, panic creeping in as she edged backward, though no loud cries escaped her lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was a flicker of anticipation hiding beneath her fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Oswald didn't waste any time. He lunged at her, pinning her to the cold, hard ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before she could get a word out, his mouth crashed onto hers, their tongues intertwining passionately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the kiss deepened, Oswald's hands wandered to Fiona's voluptuous chest, squeezing and kneading with a fierce urgency.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah..." Fiona gasped, her body trembling with a mix of desire and resistance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gradually, her struggles weakened, and instead, she found herself pulling Oswald closer, wrapping her arms around him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A surge of excitement coursed through Oswald. This woman he had dreamed about for so long was finally submitting to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clothes were discarded haphazardly as they lost themselves in the moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What if someone finds us here?" Oswald </span><span>panted,</span><span> his voice laced with concern amidst his passion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You've got the nerve to seduce me, but you're worried about getting caught? That door's locked tight, and they're not getting in," Fiona responded with a smirk, her confidence returning as she took control.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without hesitation, Fiona slipped off her clothes, revealing her creamy, supple breasts that immediately caught Oswald's eye. The sight ignited his desire to new heights.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Growling like a wild animal, Oswald lunged at them, sinking his teeth into her soft, yielding flesh. "</span><span>Mmm</span><span>..." he moaned, savoring the delicate flavor and the exquisite softness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Careful, it hurts!" Fiona chided, though her tone carried little annoyance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She pulled his head tightly against her chest, pressing him against her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Oswald felt smothered, his face buried deep in her bosom, yet the overwhelming sensation of her soft, warm curves enveloped him, filling him with a profound sense of satisfaction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fiona spoke softly but with urgency, "Listen, if the beast horde really breaches the city, we're in trouble. Don't dawdle; get on with it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I... I'm not very experienced," Oswald admitted, his face a mixture of embarrassment and nervousness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fiona couldn't help but laugh. "Well, well, looks like you're a true virgin. You might be young, but you're certainly not lacking in other areas."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her hands explored him, her eyes gleaming with a fiery desire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rolling him onto his back, Fiona mounted him, taking control with practiced ease.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come on, Fiona, can't I be on top? I'm the man here; I should be in charge," Oswald pleaded, his voice thick with both frustration and desire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Pipe down and stay still!" Fiona admonished with a playful laugh, taking charge with a firm, practiced motion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both were jolted with intense pleasure, their moans echoing in the confined space.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bright-eyed and flushed, Fiona began to move her hips in slow, deliberate circles, then accelerated, eager to ride the wave of passion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But before she could fully indulge, Oswald's expression shifted abruptly. He clutched her tightly, releasing a primal roar as ecstasy claimed him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fiona bit back a mix of laughter and frustration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fiona found herself hovering between laughter and exasperation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're such a kid. How did you finish so fast?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Oswald panted heavily, his body trembling with the aftershocks. "I... I didn't mean to," he stammered, his face flushing with embarrassment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I just... I don't want to disappoint you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fiona chuckled, giving him a playful look before reaching out to Oswald.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Little guy, I was just teasing you. Men's first times are always like this... Once you get more experience, you'll be a pro," she reassured him, her tone soothing as she helped him with her mouth and hands, reviving his spirits.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon enough, Oswald began to respond, his inexperience leading to a swift reaction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fiona was satisfied and sat back down, slowly rotating her hips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ow!" Oswald winced, his expression a mix of pleasure and worry, fearing he might not last.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fiona, am I really that bad? How many times have you moved? I swear, I only counted a few dozen moves before..." His voice trailed off, filled with self-doubt.</span></p><div class="pagination">
