  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Anne suddenly got excited.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"At your service, Mr. Hawthorne!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander smiled, and the icy demeanor he emitted felt as chilling as polar ice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Anne instantly felt a shiver down her spine, her hair standing on end, and she looked at Alexander with fear.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She thought, "Mr. Hawthorne is far more complex than he appeared!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">*****</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After leaving the hospital, Alexander went to a nearby flea market.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">According to James' teachings, he needed to craft his own Lightsaber.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Besides requiring materials like adamantine, mithril, and meteorite iron, he also needed a rare gem.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Adamantine and mithril were refined from gold and silver. To make a basic Lightsaber, he needed to refine about 44 pounds of gold and silver, which wasn't an issue given his current wealth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The only challenging part was the meteorite iron, which had to be extracted from metal-rich meteorites.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Meteorites were rare, and not every meteorite contained metal.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Besides offering Anne a high price to buy some, Alexander planned to try his luck elsewhere.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With his strong sense of the Force, if he encountered a good piece containing meteoric iron, he wouldn't miss it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"How powerful is a Novice Warrior, anyway? I haven't really tested it out yet."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander was curious.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He channeled the Force and pressed his palm against a tree by the roadside.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The tree, as thick as a bowl, snapped in half, causing passersby to flee in terror.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander smiled. Even as a Novice Warrior, and with bare hands, he was this strong. With a Lightsaber, he'd be even more formidable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If he could one day become like Luke Skywalker from the movies, he'd be practically godlike.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Unfortunately, James lived to two hundred but only reached the Intermediate..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander sighed, realizing that cultivation depended on talent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With Earth's current technology unable to achieve interstellar travel, accelerating his training by going into space was nearly impossible.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He thought, "Was there no other way, besides refining star energy, to quickly increase the Force?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander pondered this as he strolled through the flea market.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Sadly, he didn't find anything worthwhile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When Alexander returned to Bevery Hills, it was already noon.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A sharp horn blared from the front.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A black BMW sped toward him, screeching to a halt right in front of Alexander.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The car door swung open, and Ryan and Jane stormed out, full of fury.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Alexander, what are you doing here? You're still not over it, so you're stalking me, huh? How disgusting!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jane cursed, her tone full of self-importance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander sneered. "You really think too highly of yourself. I live here."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jane spat in front of Alexander, her face filled with disgust.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You're so shameless. This is Bevery Hills. You couldn't afford a bathroom here with your life savings, and you're telling me you live here?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ryan wrapped his arm around Jane, deliberately placing his hand on her backside, and boasted smugly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Kid, don't even think about Jane being with you again. I fucked her twice last night, and she called me daddy each time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"We're here to look at houses. Once I become the vice president of the Saint Group, we'll move into their mansions in Bevery Hills, and you'll always be nothing but a rat in the gutter!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Get lost! This place isn't for losers like you. Get out of here!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Facing this despicable duo, Alexander felt his stomach churn.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At the same time, he remembered Lily's broken leg, and the anger within him became harder to control.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander said in a deep voice, "I have no interest in sleeping with Jane again. I'm done with her. You can keep this trash if you like."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ryan's face turned livid with anger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You bastard! Who are you calling trash?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jane, looking like a deranged witch, bared her teeth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ryan yelled, "Alexander, kneel down and apologize, or I'll have someone cripple you right now!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Two bodyguards stepped forward, glaring menacingly at Alexander.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander's gaze turned icy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Ryan, you caused Lily to break her leg. I haven't even dealt with you for that yet. Since you've shown up, I'll start by breaking your legs today."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ryan burst into arrogant laughter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Jane, did you hear that? This lunatic is bragging again, saying he's going to break my legs."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jane rolled her eyes in disdain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Alexander, are you an idiot? Did you forget the beating you got at the hospital yesterday?"</p><div class="pagination">
