Without a replacement team, their bodies gradually became weak, and the speed at which they fired their light arrows lowered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, the sound of the Force cannons gradually died down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although the Force cannons could amplify the power of Force attacks, they also consumed the gunner's Force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But there were too many orcs swarming up like ants.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, some orcs stepped on the corpses, approached the fortress, and began to attack the city wall with the Force shield.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The magic circle provided the Force shield of the city wall, but it also consumed energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Replacing gems took time, which was the biggest flaw.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shoot!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was a roar from the wall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Light arrows shot down one after another, killing all the orcs near the city wall, leaving only broken limbs and blood on the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill!

The skin and flesh of the wound were rolled up, and the blood and flesh had turned black after drying.

He wielded the Lightsabers mechanically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He felt like he was walking lightly and was on the verge of collapse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the anger burned in his chest, like a volcano that was accumulating energy and could erupt at any time.
