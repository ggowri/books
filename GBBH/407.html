  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What do you want?" Alexander asked, his tone indifferent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, I want to take Ashley out. I'm her mother, and I want to spend time with her. Is that okay?" Jane said, glaring at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No problem," Alexander replied, "but I don't trust your intentions." With that, he turned and walked away without looking back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, stop! Who are you to keep me from seeing my daughter? I'll take you to court!" Jane shouted, furious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't have the money for the compensation and resented Alexander for ignoring her. She thought he was despicable. Jane gritted her teeth, wanting to cause trouble for him but unsure how. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite their divorce, she felt humiliated by Alexander's repeated dismissals and regretted not knowing him better during their five years of marriage. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, he was successful and confident, and she felt she should have shared in that success. But he loved someone else, and she couldn't accept it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From the day of their divorce, their lives had diverged. Alexander's focus was on his daughter and Ava, the people closest to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Simon hurried into a building and approached an office. He heard the sounds of a man and woman inside, clearly in an intimate moment. A woman's moans mixed with the sound of slapping.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Curiosity slowed Simon's pace. Through a crack in the door, he saw a bald, tattooed man and a woman on a sofa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her legs rested on the man's shoulders, and her figure was alluring. The scene made Simon blush and stirred his excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The bald man shuddered and collapsed onto the woman. He had a lean face and squinted eyes, giving off a shady vibe. The woman, undressed, cuddled against him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Daniel, take care of me more, okay? I'll do whatever you say," she cooed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daniel laughed, "My cousin is a big deal at the Red Umbrella Group. That's why I'm a supervisor here. Don't worry, I'll look after you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As their intimacy grew, Daniel seemed ready to continue when Simon barged in without knocking, unfazed by Daniel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Simon, what are you doing here?" Daniel asked, surprised but not angry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Simon replied, "I have urgent business related to a critical plan for the Red Umbrella Group."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daniel perked up, "Tell me what you need. I'm a supervisor because of you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Great!" Simon said, satisfied. "Turn on the security cameras, and I'll explain."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daniel opened his computer, entering a password to reveal surveillance images of the park. Simon quickly spotted Ava and Ashley. "I need you to focus on this girl and this woman," he pointed out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daniel's eyes widened at Ava, captivated by her beauty. He had a weakness for attractive, mature women.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Simon, are you interested in her? I'll help you!" Daniel offered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Simon slapped Daniel lightly on the head. "Focus! The girl is our primary target, and the woman is secondary, understood?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Got it. Leave it to me!" Daniel assured, nodding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After plotting for a while longer, Simon returned to keep an eye on Jane.</span></p><div class="pagination">
