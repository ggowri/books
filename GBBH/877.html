Only Alexander and Norma remained.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The fresh sea breeze swept through Norma's hair and light chiffon wrap, her graceful figure appearing ethereal, like a goddess about to take flight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She lightly touched Alexander's bare chest and laughed softly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne, you're in such great shape!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Norma picked up sunscreen and gently applied it to Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her delicate fingers brushed against his chest, back, and arms...
