  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander felt a newfound ease as he anticipated his first meeting with the Godfather.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The music continued to flow, one song after another, as more and more people took to the dance floor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Many powerful figures were treating the banquet as a prime opportunity to find potential partners.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for the servers, no matter how attractive they were, they remained little more than temporary diversions in the eyes of the guests. None of these powerful attendees would genuinely consider an ordinary person as a true partner.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne, I need to step out to take care of something. Please excuse me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shadow said before making his exit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne, may I have this dance?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosalia asked, flashing a radiant smile as she looked up at him, her elegant, curvaceous figure attracting the envious gaze of several men nearby.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander scratched his head. "Dancing? I'm not very good..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No problem, I'll teach you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without waiting for an answer, Rosalia pulled Alexander onto the dance floor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two of them embraced and danced gracefully to the music.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander clearly underestimated his own abilities. In the past, his dancing skills were indeed mediocre, but with his current sharp perception and capabilities, his dancing had naturally become quite impressive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Charlize sipped a glass of red wine at the edge of the dance floor, watching Alexander and Rosalia with a soft smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She used to feel a twinge of jealousy toward Rosalia, who, as Alexander's bodyguard, spent much more time with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But after Charlize's injury, Rosalia had visited her regularly in the hospital, watching over her safety.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since then, the two had become close friends, like sisters.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the dance progressed, Rosalia leaned closer into Alexander's chest, her voice turning wistful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne, you've been back in </span><span>Loscity</span><span> for days and didn't even visit me. Have you grown tired of me?" she asked, her tone teasing yet laced with longing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander chuckled awkwardly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've just been busy, and you were guarding both Ava and Ashley. That's my fault, and I'll make it up to you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, don't forget your promise?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosalia's smile widened as she pressed closer, wrapping her arms tightly around his waist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The soft, warm sensation of her ample curves against his chest was almost too tempting to bear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander instinctively licked his lips, momentarily tempted to kiss her right there. But with so many people around, he held back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They moved together, lost in the rhythm of the music.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's hands rested on Rosalia's hips, relishing the soft yet firm sensation beneath his grip.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The wonderful sensation was beyond words, igniting a fierce desire within both of them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their graceful movements were synchronized and mesmerizing, like two butterflies fluttering together in a beautiful dance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the song ended, Rosalia felt a dampness between her thighs, shifting uncomfortably and playfully tugging at Alexander's waistband.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander could only laugh to himself, quickly turning away to conceal his reaction from the other guests.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Does it feel well?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Charlize leaned over and whisper to Rosalia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosalia shot her a look, then mischievously ran a hand over Charlize's chest, giving a soft laugh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry, little minx. Tonight, we're both in."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, perfect"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Charlize's cheeks flushed as she swatted Rosalia's hand away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two women exchanged glances, occasionally casting hungry looks at Alexander, who was helping himself to the buffet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both Charlize and Rosalia wore snug, high-slit dresses that clung to their curves and revealed long, elegant legs, drawing even more attention from the men around them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A group of men had begun eyeing Charlize and Rosalia from across the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One of them was Levi Staggs, a highly capable subordinate of Shadow. In his thirties, he was in the prime of his life and already a metahuman with freezing power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The ones surrounding Levi were all at least level-one metahumans, each possessing various powers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Shadow did not reveal Alexander's background, so after Shadow left, the group instantly became arrogant, as if they had become the masters of the place.</span></p><div class="pagination">
