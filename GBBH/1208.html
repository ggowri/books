  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No way! How are you faster than me?" Gael's eyes went wide with disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What made it even crazier was that Alexander wasn't just moving solo. He had Brittany tucked against him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though she was petite, she had to weigh at least </span><span>110</span><span> </span><span>pounds with her height.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet Alexander was still leaving Gael in the dust.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Heh..." Alexander shot Gael a cold smirk. "For someone with level-three speed powers, you're moving pretty slow. Got to say, I'm disappointed."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't get cocky..." Gael's face turned ugly. Getting shown up at his own specialty was a bitter pill to swallow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Look, Gael, you're no match for Alexander. Do yourself a favor and back off before you embarrass yourself even more!" Brittany taunted him, not bothering to hide her disdain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gael shot back with a smirk. "What's your problem with me, Brittany? I was just warming up earlier, barely even trying. Now that I know he's got some fight in him, I want to see what he's really made of. I can't have someone dragging down our team, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes glinted dangerously. Sure, he'd missed Alexander earlier, and maybe Alexander wasn't as soft as he'd thought. But Gael refused to believe he'd lose if he </span><span>went all out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With their whole team watching, he had to save face. His reputation in the strike team was on the line.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you're really asking for it, Gael, I'll be happy to teach you a lesson," Alexander said coolly. "Don't worry. Since we're teammates now, I'll try not to mess you up too badly."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That comment nearly made Gael explode. "You cocky little..." he growled. "You think you can mess me up? Dream on! That first round, I was just testing the waters."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He glared at Alexander with pure venom. "You dodge one hit and think </span><span>you're</span><span> hot stuff? Time for you to learn what happens when you get too big for your boots, you overconfident punk!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come on, tough guy. Show me what you've really got. And everyone here can witness this. If Gael ends up crippled, don't say I didn't warn </span><span>him</span><span>," Alexander said coolly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He finally let go of Brittany and clasped his hands behind his back, looking completely unbothered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't get cocky, you little punk!" Gael snapped. Despite his big talk, his tense posture and serious expression gave away how wary he actually was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their face-off had drawn quite a crowd by now. People gathered around them, whispering excitedly among themselves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brittany wasn't worried at all. She knew Alexander was way out of Gael's league.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But most of the team members were still betting on Gael.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It made sense to them&mdash;Gael was a level-three metahuman, while Alexander didn't give off any metahuman vibes. Sure, he had some moves and decent speed, but in their minds, there was no way he could match up to Gael.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You got this, Gael! Don't let him win!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Show this guy the difference between us and regular humans. We metahumans deserve better status and better treatment in society!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The newcomers cheered Gael on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since Alexander wasn't a metahuman, this sparring match had somehow turned into a bigger fight about metahuman status versus regular humans.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As metahumans grew more powerful, many of them started looking down on regular humans. They believed they were Earth's true rulers, the future of the planet, and a superior form of existence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Show him what you've got, Alexander!" Brittany cheered from the sidelines.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Since you're so proud of your speed, let's make this a fair race. That way, you can't say I took advantage of any weaknesses when you lose."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before anyone could blink, Alexander vanished from sight. He hadn't actually disappeared&mdash;he was just moving so fast that everyone could only see blurred afterimages trailing behind him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gael's face twisted into a savage grin as he unleashed his full power, becoming nothing more than a blur himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, he was going all out. The intense pressure of the moment was even pushing his level-three ability to its limits like it was trying to break through to Level four.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At peak performance, his speed could match a bird in flight, at least for short bursts.</span><span> </span></p><div class="pagination">
