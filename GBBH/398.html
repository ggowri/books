Are you insane?" she whispered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander replied nonchalantly, "Well, it's your fault; I haven't even had breakfast yet."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mary wasn't the only one speechless; everyone else was too.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eugene began whining to Wyatt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dad, Alexander just killed Lawrence using some dirty trick, then said he'd teach me a lesson and that The Blood Gang was nothing..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eugene embellished his complaint as he glanced over at Alexander, who just kept eating and drinking without paying them any mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wyatt's expression darkened as he listened to his son's account.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lawrence was a representative of the Mafia Godfather, and he'd died right there in The Blood Gang's meeting. How was Wyatt supposed to explain this to Satan?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander kept eating and drinking as he arrived. It was obvious he didn't take Wyatt seriously. If word of this got out, it would be an utter humiliation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Furious, Wyatt ordered, leaving no room for negotiation, "Alexander, I'll give you a chance! Kneel down and bow three times, hand over the magic powder formula, and I might consider letting you go."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The tension spiked instantly as every eye turned to Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander, though the target of all the attention, continued eating and drinking as if nothing had happened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it, Alexander's really arrogant; that's our gang leader he's ignoring!" someone murmured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Did Alexander lose his mind? He's just eating," said another.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Maybe he thinks he's done for and wants one last meal," someone speculated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd buzzed with discussion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Showing off in front of me, huh?"
