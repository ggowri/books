  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Do you believe yourself worthy enough to cooperate with me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava disdainfully ignored Ryan's outstretched hand, and her contemptuous tone cut deep into his ego.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His expression soured instantly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Ms. Blackburn, I will soon be the vice president, which is on par with your position. Isn't this a bit harsh?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava sneered, "Harsh? You're nothing in my eyes."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander couldn't suppress a laugh, further embarrassing Ryan.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Ms. Blackburn, you're too arrogant. I'll report this to the chairman," Ryan threatened.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He could barely contain his anger, yet he dared not lift a finger in vengeance for Ava.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jane chimed in with venom, "Alexander, don't get too cocky. You're just her plaything; she'll discard you eventually. Ryan is the vice president, and I am his wife-to-be."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava and Alexander exchanged amused glances, completely disregarding Jane and treating her as if she were invisible.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jane's fury was palpable, and she was plotting her revenge when the host of the ball ascended the stage in a dazzling gown, prompting a round of warm applause from the guests.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The hosts had arrived, so the mysterious chairman was about to make an appearance, sending a wave of anticipation through the crowd.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ryan exclaimed excitedly, "Jane, quickly wheel me onto the stage. The chairman is about to announce me as the vice president!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jane shot Alexander a fierce glare.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What talent do you have besides relying on women? My fianc&eacute; is the real talent!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She wheeled Ryan toward the stage with pride.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A murmur of envy rippled through the room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">All guests congratulated Ryan and Jane and applauded as the couple made their way to the stage, making them feel as though they had reached an unparalleled peak in their lives.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ryan was on the cusp of becoming the vice president of the Saint Group, so others had to give him the respect he deserved.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jane stood on the stage, looking down at the crowd. A sense of superiority washed over her. Her face beamed with pride and joy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She cast a haughty glance at Alexander, who was heading towards the bathroom, and sneered, deeming him a lost cause.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava paid no mind to Alexander's bathroom break because her thoughts were occupied with the nature of the relationship between the new chairman and Ryan.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ryan's face flushed with excitement at the envious and jealous stares from the guests.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">People who he could never afford to offend now looked up to him from the audience.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He grabbed the microphone with excitement and exclaimed, "Thank you all for your congratulations. From today on, I will also be the newest rising star in Loscity!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The expressions in the audience grew more complex.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">There was no denying that at this moment, Ryan and Jane were standing at the pinnacle of their lives.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just then, the emcee at the door announced, "The secretary of the chairman of the Saint Group, Anne Hollister, has arrived!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Under the watchful eyes of the crowd, Anne glided in, wearing a black backless evening gown.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ryan's voice quivered with excitement, "Ms. Hollister, is the chairman here? When will he announce me as the vice president?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Anne calmly replied after stepping onto the stage, "The chairman will be here shortly."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her words sparked a new round of chatter. Anne hadn't contradicted Ryan; it seemed he might truly become the vice president.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The last shreds of doubt in many hearts vanished, and they regarded Ryan with newfound respect.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Anne thought, "Vice President?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She inwardly scoffed, and her eyes spoke volumes of her disdain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ryan declared proudly, "Everyone, since the chairman hasn't arrived yet, allow me to share a few words and introduce the future development plan I've devised for the Saint Group."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The guests looked at Ava with peculiar expressions. Was Ryan, not yet officially the vice president, poised to challenge Ava?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava looked livid, and her features contorted into a mask of dismay. The looming possibility that Ryan might have won the chairman's favor cast a long, ominous shadow over her future at the helm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With a smirk playing on her lips, Jane initiated a deliberate clap and yelled at Ava, "Ms. Blackburn, why not join us in applause? Or perhaps you're doubting the chairman's wisdom, reluctant to welcome my husband's report?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just as the air thickened with confrontation, a voice cut through the room, reverberating with an authority that seemed to vibrate through the very walls.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Ryan, just who do you think you are? How dare you spew such nonsense here?"</p><div class="pagination">
