  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"With this Heaven's Grass from Mr. Patterson, I can create an antidote powder to wipe </span><span>out this epidemic!" Alexander declared confidently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Really?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Oscar and Gideon's faces lit up with hope and excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The guards' eyes widened in amazement, deeply impressed by Alexander's capabilities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you, Mr. Hawthorne. Though I spent a fortune acquiring this Heaven's Grass, it's yours if you need it!" Gideon readily agreed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He carefully lifted the pot of Heaven's Grass and presented it to Alexander with the utmost respect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne, in addition to the Heaven's Grass, I'll prepare a million-dollar compensation to thank you for saving me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander accepted the Heaven's Grass without hesitation and said with a smile, "Mr. Patterson, I have a favor to ask in return. I'm very interested in the military's combat armor and exoskeletons. I'd like to discuss a potential collaboration."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gideon paused for a moment, giving Alexander a complicated look.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne, if you can eliminate this epidemic, I'm willing to collaborate with you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Excellent! Then it's a deal!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's face lit up with joy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Oscar grinned, patting Gideon on the shoulder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This calls for a celebration! See, Gideon, didn't I tell you Alexander was brilliant at medicine?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You sure did! I feel embarrassed for doubting him!" Gideon admitted, his face flushing red with embarrassment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To be honest, he'd been skeptical at first, thinking it was worth a shot but not expecting much.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, the security guards were treating Alexander with utmost respect, not daring to show even a hint of disrespect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Gentlemen, I should get back to Ava. She must be getting impatient. We'll catch up later," Alexander excused himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Having just reunited with Ava, he knew better than to keep her waiting. He had his priorities straight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course, go ahead! Ms. Blackburn, Ms. Hansen, and Mary must be wondering where you are," Oscar said with a knowing smirk.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gideon laughed as he exchanged contact information with Alexander, agreeing to discuss their collaboration in detail after the epidemic was under control.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander turned and headed back toward the villa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gideon watched Alexander's figure disappear before speaking admiringly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne's already achieved so much at such a young age. He's a genuine prodigy!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Oscar nodded emphatically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're absolutely right, bro. We need to stay on his good side! He's destined for even greater things."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gideon fully agreed with Oscar's assessment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two bigwigs, now in good spirits, sat down for drinks and conversation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This plague is getting out of hand. Word is they're locking down the city tomorrow. Who knows if other regions will be affected?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's right! I wouldn't even leave my house if it weren't for the strict prevention measures here at the banquet," Oscar said with a heavy sigh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tens of thousands dead already, and the higher-ups are covering it up. If this </span><span>continues, even our gated communities won't be safe. It'll be hell on earth."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gideon furrowed his brow. The situation looked grim.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That many deaths? If this keeps spreading, </span><span>Loscity</span><span> is totally screwed, isn't it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Oscar was stunned; this plague was genuinely terrifying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both men fell silent, the atmosphere growing heavy with tension.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander returned to the banquet hall, where couples were gracefully dancing to melodious music.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The evening had been a success, with everyone managing to find joy despite the looming threat of the plague.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the banquet drew to a close, Rebecca pressed against Alexander's ear and whispered sweetly, "Don't forget to come see me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her sultry figure clung to him as she shot him a coy, slightly reproachful look.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander chuckled awkwardly, not knowing what to say since he was definitely spending the night with Ava.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just after he'd finally managed to see Rebecca off, Mary grabbed him and pulled him into her car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mary threw herself into his embrace, gave him a passionate kiss, and even slipped her hand into his pants, skillfully groping him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Honey, you're really bold. Aren't you worried someone </span><span>might</span><span> see?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander couldn't help but grab her big tits, kneading them as the smooth flesh shifted in his hands.</span></p><div class="pagination">
