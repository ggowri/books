  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander sent out his Force, letting it ripple through the night like waves on a dark shore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His enhanced vision pierced the darkness better than any night vision goggles could manage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All around him, bugs and critters scattered the moment they sensed his overwhelming presence, like they'd just spotted the king of the jungle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Well, most of them scattered. One dumb snake decided to coil up and flick its tongue at him, ready to strike.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wrong move," Alexander scoffed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before the snake could even strike, his foot came down hard. The venomous reptile's head was crushed instantly, leaving its body writhing uselessly in the dirt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander didn't even break stride. He kept moving, his heightened senses scanning the area until </span><span>he</span><span> </span><span>picked up on some subtle traces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Humph, bet you idiots didn't expect me to track you down this fast."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes flashed with killer intent as he suppressed his energy, sliding like a ghost toward a hidden cave entrance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The cave was seriously well-concealed. Bushes and vines covered the opening so thoroughly that nobody would spot it unless they knew exactly what they were looking for.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it weren't for Alexander's Force powers acting like a sixth sense, he wouldn't have noticed anything at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once Alexander masked his presence, he seemed to melt into his surroundings completely. Like a ghostly shadow, he drifted toward the cave entrance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The cave mouth wasn't particularly large, but it stretched deep into darkness, its floor littered with loose rocks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Someone had rigged up trip wires, too</span><span>&mdash;</span><span>the moment anyone walked in, they'd trigger an alarm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Deep inside, a campfire burned low.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In its dim light sat a young man dressed in black beside the flames.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His face was gaunt and twisted, his exposed skin covered in scars that gave off an eerie vibe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Next to him on a rock lay two sabers in black sheaths, identical to Stephen's blade.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander couldn't help but be surprised. Stephen's saber was legendary</span><span>&mdash;</span><span>it could slice through steel like butter. Could the Sakra Society really mass produce weapons of that caliber?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The figure in black was clearly as skilled as Stephen, if not more so. Their power levels seemed pretty much on par.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander had to admit that he was impressed by the hidden strength of the Sakra Society. They really lived up to their reputation as </span><span>Risun's</span><span> oldest and most powerful organization.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even after being suppressed by major world powers, they still packed this kind of punch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lynn lay on the ground, thoroughly tied up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her eyes were slightly closed, but she definitely wasn't sleeping. Her clothes were intact, which was a good sign</span><span>&mdash;</span><span>at least she hadn't been mistreated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing this, Alexander let out a long breath he hadn't realized he'd been holding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If anything had happened to Lynn, he wouldn't know how to face her, let alone explain it to Ava.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander couldn't help but smirk in the darkness. If the Sakra Society wanted to play dirty, he'd show them exactly what that meant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Like a ghost in the shadows, Alexander crept forward without making a sound, ready to take out the black-clad figure in one swift move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was getting close now, maybe 16 feet away. Just as Alexander was about to strike, the figure suddenly leaped to Lynn's side, shouting in panic, "Who's there? Someone's here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander froze. He hadn't expected this guy to detect him at all. It looked like he might be even stronger than Stephen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How'd you manage to find me?" Alexander asked curiously as he casually stepped out from the shadows.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander! You're here! Be careful!" Lynn's eyes went wide with both joy and worry </span><span>when she heard his voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shut up!" The man in black pressed his saber against Lynn's breast. "One more word out of you, and I swear I'll kill you, you little bitch."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lynn's face went ghostly pale. She fell silent, looking helplessly at Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, Alexander. You've wrecked Sakra Society's Apocalypse Project and killed so many of our people. How do you plan to answer for that?" The man in black kept his eyes locked on Alexander, not daring to let his guard down for even a second.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's stealth skills had seriously rattled him. If things had gone just a bit differently, Alexander could have gotten the drop on him, and he'd have been dead before he knew what hit him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Plus, the man in black couldn't wrap his head around how Alexander had tracked him down so quickly on his own. If he didn't know for a fact that his people were completely loyal, he'd have sworn someone had sold him out.</span></p><div class="pagination">
