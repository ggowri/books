  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Bobby was sly and devious, always forming cliques back in college, bullying classmates and causing all sorts of trouble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At the time, Alexander was naive and often fell victim to Bobby's schemes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They had fought a few times in the past, and both had come out worse for it. The rivalry had lingered ever since.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Craig kindly warned him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Don't get into it with that guy. Bobby's petty and has a small mind. Now that you're here, he might try to pull something. Just ignore him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What's he going to try?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander sneered, dismissing the idea.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Don't worry. As long as he doesn't start anything, I'm fine. Since he's treating us to dinner, we'll enjoy the meal. Might as well take advantage of it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Craig burst out laughing. "You're right. We're here to eat, not to deal with him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Craig then gave Alexander a curious glance, noticing how different he seemed, more confident, with the vibe of someone important.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The three of them followed the waiter to a large hall inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>There were already ten tables set up, almost full.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Not just their classmates but also their spouses or plus-ones.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It seemed Bobby's popularity was still strong. People were eager to attend and show him respect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Hey, look who's here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As Alexander walked in, Bobby, who was sitting at the head of the table, immediately stood up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Bobby was around the same age as Alexander, but he had put on some weight and had a big gut. He wore a sharp suit, a thick gold chain around his neck, several gold rings on his fingers, and a flashy gold Rolex on his wrist that sparkled under the lights, almost as if he wanted to make sure everyone knew how wealthy he was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alice let out a derisive snort upon seeing Bobby's appearance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What a country bumpkin."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander smiled. Bobby certainly looked tacky.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But since they were classmates, and Bobby seemed genuinely happy to see him, Alexander gave him a handshake.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As their hands met, Bobby suddenly tightened his grip, trying to make Alexander look bad by forcing a show of strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>No matter how hard Bobby tried, Alexander didn't flinch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander was annoyed by this childish attempt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He responded with a slight increase in pressure, and Bobby immediately yelped in pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ow! Let go... Let go of me..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone stared, thinking that Alexander had intentionally humiliated Bobby.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Someone quickly stepped in, reprimanding, "Alexander, what are you doing? Let go!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander shrugged and released Bobby.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Bobby, sweating from the pain, gritted his teeth and said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'm trying to do a good thing by hosting this reunion, and you actually pull this sneak attack. You're so despicable."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander raised an eyebrow and shrugged. "Wasn't it you who squeezed first?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Craig and some of the other classmates quickly intervened to smooth things over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Come on. Just forget it. We're all classmates here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"It was just a misunderstanding. It's a reunion. Let's have fun."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Bobby, realizing he wasn't a match for Alexander, shot him a few sideways glances, then turned his attention to Alice. His eyes widened in surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He gave a dismissive humph and sarcastically said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Alexander, I've met your wife Jane before. This isn't her. Looks like you're a real scumbag, cheating on your wife with someone else."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Craig quickly explained, "You're mistaken. This is Alexander's secretary."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone froze for a moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Hahaha!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Bobby burst out laughing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"A kept man like him can afford a secretary? This is too much! Maybe she's just some prostitute he hired to play along, trying to look like a big shot in front of us."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander's eyes darkened, and his voice turned icy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Bobby, apologize to my secretary right now, or I'll knock all your teeth out."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alice, who had been about to lose her temper, couldn't help but feel a sweet sense of satisfaction hearing Alexander defend her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Bobby sneered and turned to the others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Do you really believe this is his secretary? Look at him, a poor guy who can barely make ends meet, and he's got the money to hire a secretary?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If everyone really thinks she's his secretary, then I'll apologize."</span></p><div class="pagination">
