  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cheers and applause erupted from the crowd below, leaving Jalen's throat hoarse from shouting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Logan covered his ears, scoffing, "This is bullshit. There's a hidden door under the cabinet that leads to the stage. It's so obvious."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smiled, knowing that for most people, this was all new. It wasn't like him and Logan, who were used to such tricks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the finale wrapped up, the show came to an end. Alexander herded Logan and Jalen towards the gate of the yard to wait.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Logan looked at Alexander with sympathy. "If you really like him, I support you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander rolled his eyes. "I'm just grateful. The pills he gave me worked wonders and helped me break through to level two as a warrior. Am I not allowed to thank him?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, only a few people remained, and the young man in white was still nowhere to be found.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander furrowed his brow and returned to the yard, where he spotted the maid crying in a corner not far away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He approached her, bowing slightly. "Excuse me, where is your master?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The maid, Lana, looked up, her face streaked with tears, and suddenly clutched Alexander's sleeve, exclaiming, "It's you! You and Julius... Please help me find Her... my master."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander frowned, asking, "Is he missing?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lana sobbed, "It's all my fault. I shouldn't have let her go to the stage. Actually, she's a woman."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander scanned the empty yard; the audience had departed, and the stage was deserted, sending a chill down his spine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, a man emerged from behind the stage curtain. It was the older Risunese who performed the Disappearing Act.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Alexander took a closer look, he was taken aback; this man was no ordinary performer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Risunese had changed drastically. His hair was gray, with a bald patch on top.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His forehead was lined with deep wrinkles, and crow's feet etched the corners of his eyes, giving him a sinister look akin to a serpent ready to strike. His stride was steady and powerful, and his large hands hinted at martial prowess.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lana moved to approach the Risunese, but Alexander pulled her back, deliberately raising his voice, "Your master must have left early. Let's go back and look for him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He tugged on Lana's sleeve and headed toward the courtyard gate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Noticing only Lana was left, Logan asked in surprise, "That sissy... Oh, sorry! Where's that young man?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's face darkened. "It's a woman disguised as a man, and now she's gone."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jalen shouted, "Could it be that those Risunese really have magical powers?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander glanced around, confirming they were alone. He instructed the two, "Logan, let's go inside and check later tonight. You see if there's a back door and keep an eye on it. Call me if anything happens, but don't act recklessly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Jalen, take Lana back to Emerald Manor to settle in first."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Turning to Lana, Alexander bowed earnestly. "Lana, don't worry. Your lady has helped me, and I will definitely find her and keep her safe."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you," Lana replied, reluctantly departing with Jalen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Logan moved towards the back of the yard, Alexander stared at the beautiful circus banner of Risun Circus, his fists tightening hard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He muttered to himself, "How dare those Risun bastards stir up trouble here? But I can't act rashly, or I'll end up dead..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Behind the courtyard curtain, several shadowy Risunese whispered among themselves. Reece Perumal, a short Risunese with a noticeable black mole on his face, chuckled lewdly, "Mr. Burkart, that woman was truly stunning. Thankfully, I have a keen eye and realized at once she was masquerading as a man."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Reece, that woman is not simple. We can't act against her just yet. We need to uncover her true identity first," replied Arturo Burkart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Arturo fiddled with a gold plate in his hand, which displayed a grand Five Phoenix Tower on one side and a line of small text on the other, reading: [The Thirteenth...]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the blink of an eye, Alexander had been guarding the entrance to the alley leading to the compound for four hours. It was getting late, and his anxiety was rising.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, someone called out, "Alexander! Alexander!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Looking up, he saw Logan waving at him from a corner.</span></p><div class="pagination">
