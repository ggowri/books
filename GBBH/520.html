How come you're so timid? Did Alexander scare you that badly?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix's face turned stormy as he clenched his fists tightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He swore that one day, he would repay this humiliation to the entire Morris family a hundred times over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But for now, he kept his composure, careful not to let Barry see his anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead, he smiled politely. "Mr. Morris, would you like to rest a bit before hitting the casino?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barry glanced at Felix with a smirk. "Sure, we'll rest a bit first."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Felix took a couple of steps closer to Barry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, an icy surge of hostility enveloped him, like a cold snap.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hiss!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix sucked in a sharp breath, his body tensing like a coiled spring, ready to snap.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Turning, he saw Diego glaring at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diego sneered and said, "Mr. Vanderbilt, please don't get too close. Keep your distance. For the master's safety, I won't hesitate to take action."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix kept a stony face and stayed silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No matter how much he bore these insults, or curbed his temper, he still had his pride.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What? You don't think I'm right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diego's presence grew even more menacing, his gaze fixed harshly on Felix.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix shot him a fierce glare, their eyes clashing with an almost visible spark.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barry, who was walking ahead, stopped and looked back at Felix with a mock smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Vanderbilt, what are you doing? Diego's just concerned for my safety. Do you have a problem with that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix trembled with anger, his fury building.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He held back for a long moment before finally swallowing his rage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No worries, Mr. Morris. I just misunderstood. No problem at all."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barry nodded in satisfaction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joyce shot Felix a scornful look, muttering under her breath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Glad you got it. If you're still feeling defiant, we can go for a round..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even this decorative little secretary looked down on him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix's anger toward Barry and the others grew even stronger. He swore to himself </span><span>that these clueless fools would pay for their arrogance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barry led the way, with Diego and Joyce flanking him on either side, while Felix trailed behind like a loyal lapdog.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Right next to the Kaylon Hotel was the Kaylon Casino, touted as the largest in town, offering every kind of leisure and entertainment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As long as you had money, you could gamble here and be surrounded by beautiful women, with celebrities, models, and influencers often present.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These temptations for men came at a clear price, a straightforward money-for-pleasure deal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unsurprisingly, the Kaylon Casino became wildly popular soon after it opened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ordinary folks couldn't even get in; it offered everything, but at a steep cost.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Waves, beaches, sunshine, bikini-clad beauties, and a variety of gourmet foods&mdash;an absolute paradise for the wealthy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Barry entered his suite.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The top floor had several suites, the largest one spanning over 300 square yards.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix acted like a hotel concierge, personally opening the door to welcome Barry with a smile plastered on his face, as if he'd forgotten the earlier tension.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joyce waved at Felix impatiently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Enough, stop fussing! You can go now. Make sure the hotel sends over the lunch menu so we can decide what to eat."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, I'll have them send the menu over shortly."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix nodded with a smile and turned to leave, showing no hint of anger as if he were born to serve them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barry watched Felix obediently leave the room like a servant and even call for the menu afterward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From beginning to end, Felix was more polite and attentive than any hotel staff, keeping a charming smile the whole time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When it was all over, the smile on Barry's face vanished, replaced by cold indifference.</span></p><div class="pagination">
