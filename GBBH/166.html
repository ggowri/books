  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a considerable pause, Alexander firmly pushed her away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mary, I have a girlfriend. This isn't right..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mary's gaze softened considerably. Even in such a situation, Alexander hadn't succumbed. He was one of the few genuine men left; most others would have already started tearing off her clothes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The more aloof and unattainable Alexander seemed, the more excited Mary became. She was feeling an intense desire to conquer him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, you remind me so much of my late husband... so much..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mary stared at him, dazzled by her own conviction that fate had brought them together.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dismissing all other thoughts, Mary began to kiss Alexander passionately, her hands roaming over his chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Pressing her cheek against his chest to feel his strong heartbeat, she surrendered to the rising tides of joy and affection.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander sighed in resignation. "Mary, this isn't right."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmph! You may say no with your words, but your body tells a different story</span><span>.</span><span>" </span><span>She </span><span>glanc</span><span>ed</span><span> at the prominent bulge in his pants with a teasing smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come here," Mary said, thrusting her ample bosom towards Alexander, pulling him into an embrace that seemed ready to smother him between her bountiful breasts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the last vestiges of his sanity, Alexander managed to push Mary away once more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Undeterred, Mary reached into Alexander's pants.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You need to be careful at the Kaylon's gem auction. </span><span>Houtte</span><span> plans to target you&mdash;he wants the formula for the magic powder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you don't want me to team up with </span><span>Houtte</span><span>, take me... I'm willing to be yours, and all the Blood Gang's </span><span>Loscity</span><span> operations will be under your command.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you refuse, we're enemies from now on."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, Alexander felt the last straw break. The suppressed desire within him erupted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Securing the Blood Gang's power in </span><span>Loscity</span><span> would be invaluable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Additionally, having sex with Mary could accelerate the absorption of James' Force, hitting two birds with one stone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Besides, Alexander was, after all, a normal man. The temptation of a mature and voluptuous woman was too much to resist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mary was in her prime, having been without a man's touch since her husband's passing, and she was more than ready.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quickly disrobing Alexander, she found themselves on a secluded lakeside path.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mary's touch was alluring, her fingers drawing languid patterns on his skin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, you're as big as a horse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Trying to play innocent, huh? Today, I'll make sure you remember this&mdash;and behave afterward," she teased, her voice dripping with seduction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a swift motion, Mary straddled him, trapping him firmly in her grasp.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah!" Alexander gasped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Compared to </span><span>Lara</span><span> or Betty, Mary was undeniably more </span><span>skilled</span><span>&mdash;an older wine, indeed, more intoxicating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fortunately, Alexander was well-endowed and augmented by the Force, allowing him to remain steady, no matter how frantic Mary became.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander felt the change in James' Force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The seemingly frozen energy began to loosen under the growing intensity of their pleasure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ecstatic, Alexander pressed on, embracing Mary's bountiful buttocks as he fully surrendered to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From a distance, a car approached.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>David was inside, cursing, "Damn it, those losers Mark assembled couldn't even abduct a single woman."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The driver suddenly exclaimed, "Isn't that Mary's car? It's shaking a lot&mdash;something must be wrong!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>David peered out and saw the truth, his expression contorted with fury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Something wrong? She's fucking someone in the car!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The bitch refused me time and again, but here she is getting off&mdash;so desperate it's unbelievable!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feeling sympathy, the driver glanced at David.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>David's rage was almost physical.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had planned for Mary to be kidnapped and imprisoned in his dungeon, only to be thwarted by Mark's failure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The driver asked cautiously, "Should I go break them up?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>David exhaled a long, bitter sigh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What good would that do? Today, I'm going to see who the hell has the guts to steal a woman from me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And so, David waited&mdash;for over an hour, to be precise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By the time David's face turned livid, the swaying Bentley finally began to calm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Goddamn, did that guy pop pills? Over an hour&mdash;he's a beast!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>David felt a surge of jealousy. Even with double the dose of magic powder, he could only last twenty minutes at most.</span></p><div class="pagination">
