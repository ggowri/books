Their breathing was powerful, and their bulging muscles were full of explosive power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the age of twenty, Yinson had already fought in all underground boxing matches in </span><span>Risun</span><span> and had never been defeated, winning 83 consecutive fights.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Several decades had passed. No one knew how excellent his fighting skills were now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The person sitting between Brandon and Yinson was actually a white-haired elderly woman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clad a white wizard robe, she was skinny. With a white skull necklace around her neck, she exuded a spooky and eerie aura.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her eyes were fixed upon the screen, and her expression was very ferocious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was the lord of the City of Sorcery, the white wizard, Monica Quinn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had been learning witchcraft from her mother since childhood. Because of her mother's doting and the lack of her father's discipline, she grew ruthless and would eliminate an entire family at any time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Therefore, a very powerful dark wizard warned her to be more restrained and not kill so many people.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Monica, who had just been promoted to a gray wizard at that time, could only pretend to accept his advice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ten years later, she became a dark wizard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The dark wizard, his wife, and his children were all killed by her overnight, and their bodies were hung upside down on a tree until they were dried into mummies by the wind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Monica's ferocity and cruelty shocked the City of Sorcery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Decades had passed. She had become the most powerful white wizard and the lord of the City of Sorcery with her extraordinary strength and cruel style.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yinson said with a sinister smile, "It is a good day for the Sakra Society, the Red Umbrella Group, and the City of Sorcery to completely occupy Treasure Island. After today, it will be ours!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked at Brandon complacently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Godfather, why don't you join forces with us? You must be upset that you have missed such a great chance."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brandon crossed his legs, took a deep puff of his cigar, and said calmly, "Everyone, </span><span>Heinrich is behind the Brilliant Group. I think it's unrealistic for you to take over Treasure Island easily."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yinson waved his hand with full confidence, and his subordinates immediately adjusted the image on the display screen to make it clearer and clearer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before, they could see many people fighting in the square, but now the LCD screen was blank.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were only several people in the square in front of the Red Umbrella Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, the satellite images showed distortion and dots from time to time, apparently due to strong interference.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Monica frowned and asked with displease, "What happened? Did something happen?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yinson quickly picked up the satellite phone and called Hana.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The mechanical voice rang over and over again, but no one answered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Did something really happen?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yinson and even Brandon frowned deeply.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yinson hung up and called someone else, but again, there was no answer.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Did something really happen at Treasure Island? That's impossible. The Sakra Society, together with the City of Sorcery and the Red Umbrella Group, are working together. How could we lose?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Expressionless, Brandon put out his cigar and said, "It must be Heinrich who took action. Otherwise, why didn't anyone answer the phone? Just wait. There will be definite news soon."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Monica contacted Rock and had a premonition.</span></p><div class="pagination">
