  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander nodded with satisfaction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Very good. Magic powders are our main source of profit. We must ensure that there is no shortage of them in the market. For employees who are willing to move their families to Treasure Island, their salaries will be increased by half, and they will be given priority for promotion."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Lamont suddenly became excited.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Really? Then I'll be the first one willing to move my whole family to Treasure Island. With such generous conditions, at least half of the employees will be willing to move there."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander smiled slightly. He thought, "It is the effect I want.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Money means nothing to me now, not to mention that magic powders are high-profit products. What's important to me is to control talents."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Wood, why are you hiding from me? You can't avoid me forever!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Suddenly, a sarcastic voice sounded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander turned around and saw a middle-aged man in a Loscity Revenue Service uniform striding towards them with a group of people.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Lamont's expression changed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He quickly whispered to Alexander, "This is Todd Jared, the director of the Loscity Revenue Service. He immigrated from Risun. He relies on his background in the Dragon Gang and even does not respect the mayor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Todd wants us to pay 30 million dollars a month in protection fees. Otherwise, he will impose another one billion dollars in taxes on us."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At that moment, Todd saw Betty and immediately became excited.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Hey, isn't this Ms. Rowe? I'm so lucky to meet you here. Ms. Rowe, I invited you to the bar for a drink last time. Why didn't you go? Do you look down on me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Todd strode over. His lustful eyes stared at Betty, roaming around her plump breasts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As for Alexander, Todd ignored him. He thought Alexander was a nobody.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Betty rolled her eyes at him in disgust and said coldly, "Mr. Jared, I don't like going to the bar with you. And don't waste your time. We won't pay you the 30 million dollars in protection fee.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If you continue to pester us, we will report your actions to the mayor and Mr. Blunt. You don't want to lose your position as a director, do you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Todd's smile disappeared immediately. He was furious to see that Betty didn't respect him in front of so many people.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Betty, don't be so proud. Others are afraid of the Ultimate Alliance, but I'm not.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Do you know the Dragon Gang? They are one of the best in the Risun. Even the Sakra Society has to respect them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"My cousin is the leader of the Dragon Gang. You will suffer a great loss."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Todd finished speaking and narrowed his eyes, smiling sinisterly at Betty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Just then, Alexander stepped out and mocked, "What kind of shitty gang is the Dragon Gang? I've never heard of it. If you dare to deliberately make things difficult for us again, I'll make you suffer a great loss now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He was just a director of the Loscity Revenue Service. The Dragon Gang was not even a local gang in Loscity, but he really thought he was the king.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Todd was furious. "Who the hell are you? Did I talk to you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Someone then came close to his ear and whispered something.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Todd immediately showed a surprised expression. "Are you Alexander?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Alexander, I'm warning you. You are threatening law enforcement officers! Believe it or not, I will arrest you right now. How dare a guy who relies on women be so presumptuous in front of me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Suddenly, Alexander slapped Todd in the face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Todd fell fifteen feet away and spat out a mouthful of blood, which contained several teeth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"How dare you hit me? Arrest him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Todd was shouting wildly. But his subordinates looked embarrassed and hesitated, not daring to take action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander was already a household name in Loscity. Some people might not know him, but they had definitely heard of his deeds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What are you standing there for? He is evading taxes and resisting law enforcement. Arrest him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Todd was going crazy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander mocked, "Todd, believe it or not, I will call Mr. Blunt right now and ask you to leave immediately."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Do... Do you know Mr. Blunt?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Todd's expression changed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He could ignore the mayor by relying on the Dragon Gang, but he couldn't afford to offend Anderson.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His subordinate next to him hurried out to mediate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Jared, Mr. Hawthorne, it is all a misunderstanding!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
