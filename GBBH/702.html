  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A grotesque expression of rage twisted Felix's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He let out a blood-curdling roar and launched a barrage of attacks against Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet Alexander deflected each strike effortlessly, leaving a trail of wounds on Felix's body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Felix dodged quickly enough that the Lightsabers only grazed his skin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's expression turned grave as he noticed Felix's increasing speed and the sinister aura growing stronger around him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix's face had become inhuman, his eyes now just protruding white orbs without pupils.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>So</span><span> this is the power of demons? Pretty pathetic if you ask me!" Alexander taunted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix responded with furious roars, barely able to stutter out words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You... must... die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the dark power consumed him further, Felix was losing his ability to form coherent speech.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Felix opened his mouth to speak again, a flash of white light appeared silently at his side.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"CRACK!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite Felix's quick reflexes, Alexander's blade still caught his left arm, severing it completely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The pale, shriveled arm fell to the ground without bleeding, writhing like a snake.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I... will... kill... you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix howled in rage, seemingly immune to pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A mass of flesh began to writhe at the stump of his left arm. Tissue sprouted and rapidly grew, quickly taking the shape of a new limb.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Felix's already pale and withered body deteriorated even further.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The dark power clearly corrupted his body. The more strength he gained, the more damage it caused him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though Felix was mighty, he wasn't in immediate danger of dying. It was just a question of whether he could kill Alexander before his body gave out ultimately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander gave a cold smirk.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Keep this up and I won't even need to lift a finger. That dark power will drain you dry, and you'll die a meaningless death."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're... so... naive!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix let out a twisted laugh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Like a deranged psychopath, he wore a smug expression that Alexander found absurd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, Felix pulled out a dagger and plunged it deep into his chest. Blood gushed out like a fountain, dripping onto the ground and seeping into the magic circle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're... finished... My master... is coming..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix stuttered before collapsing to his knees, his body convulsing violently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander frowned at the bizarre scene before him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hadn't expected Felix to take his own life. Clearly, the dark power had taken control of him. He'd brought this on himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander muttered to himself, "If even Felix got possessed, this evil force must be incredibly powerful."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix's blood covered the floor, and every last drop was absorbed into the ritual circle, turning him into the perfect sacrifice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Having consumed enough power, the Demon Summoning Array began to pulse with a blood-red glow that grew increasingly blinding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander squinted involuntarily as the light became so intense it made his skin prickle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without hesitation, he bolted from the monitoring room and sprinted up the stairs toward the plaza above.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Being underground was too risky - any intense fighting could cause a cave-in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix, practically a walking corpse now, had nothing to fear, but Alexander wasn't taking any chances.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, the entire ground began to shake as if Treasure Island was hit by an earthquake, with massive energy threatening to burst from below.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A series of blinding red beams shot up from underground, piercing straight through to the sky.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the plaza, when the light touched William, the blood mist surrounding him instantly vanished, melting away like ice under a scorching sun.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The swarm of vampire bats darkening the sky stopped following commands and scattered in panic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh no!" William shouted, quickly backing away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Augusta's massive form was forced to shrink back to a standard size, her werewolf bloodline strength and speed vanishing without a trace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Felix must be making his move!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Charlize and Rosalia's faces went ghost white with worry for Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone instinctively backed away from the plaza, putting as much distance as they could between themselves and the impending confrontation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They all felt the overwhelming power was beyond their ability to resist. Their only hope now rested with Alexander.</span></p><div class="pagination">
