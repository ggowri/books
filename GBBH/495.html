  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander glared coldly at the bald man dressed in black. His voice was as icy as steel. "You dared to lay a finger on my daughter?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the blink of an eye, Alexander was already standing before the man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The bald man's face twisted in terror. He was a lightning-type metahuman, one of the fastest&mdash;second only to speed types.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But in Alexander's presence, he felt as helpless as a child learning to walk.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Smack!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander raised his hand and slapped him hard across the face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The force sent the man flying backward, his face grotesquely contorted under the impact. Even his eyeballs seemed to bulge from the blow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before he could even hit the ground, blood spurted from his mouth in thick streams.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, he crashed into a wall several meters away, motionless, like a broken doll.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Red Umbrella Group members gasped in </span><span>horror,</span><span> their confidence shattered. The remaining two metahumans immediately launched an attack on Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One wielded fire, the other ice&mdash;two opposing forces crashing toward Alexander from either side.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Swish!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A dazzling white blade flashed through the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two level-one metahumans froze in place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as confusion flickered across their faces, blood erupted from deep cuts at their waists, and their bodies fell in two heavy halves onto the floor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander waved a hand, his voice chilling. "Kill them all. Leave no one alive."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was only then that Marvin and Logan snapped to attention. With a fierce nod, they charged forward alongside members of the Ultimate Alliance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Red Umbrella Group's strongest fighters had already been eliminated by Alexander, leaving the remaining members in utter panic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They turned to flee, but both ends of the corridor were already blocked by the Ultimate Alliance, leaving no escape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The floor was painted with the blood of Red Umbrella's agents, their bodies strewn across the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every plea for mercy was met with swift, unrelenting execution.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a matter of moments, the corridor had transformed into a hellish scene.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's expression was like stone as he turned to Betty. "What happened here? Where's Ashley?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Betty jolted, snapping out of her daze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hurry! Get to the operating room and save Ashley! The doctors here have been bought off by the Red Umbrella Group&mdash;they're planning to dissect her to obtain first-hand research data.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's my fault...I should have foreseen their scheme. When they said she needed emergency treatment, I let them take her into surgery. But then I got the intel, and Red Umbrella's people showed up as well!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without a second thought, Alexander bolted toward the operating room. His murderous intent filled the hallway, sending shivers down the spine of anyone in his path.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The metal doors to the operating room were shut, glowing with the red "In Surgery" light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander could hear the doctors' conversation inside, and his All-seeing Eyes revealed the scene.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ashley lay on the surgical table, her little face ghostly pale, eyes closed, unmoving.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Paul, what are you doing? The patient can still be saved, but you're preparing for a dissection. This is murder!" protested a middle-aged doctor with a square face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul smirked, utterly dismissive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yohan, do you have any idea who's behind this request for data? The Red Umbrella Group. Surely, you understand what that means.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And besides, when we're done, you'll be paid five million, along with a host of other benefits."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Yohan remained resolute in his refusal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No way! I won't allow you to dissect a living patient. No amount of money can convince me otherwise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We're doctors, not murderers! I won't allow this dissection!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul laughed mockingly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This little girl's body contains research data that the Red Umbrella Group desperately needs. Whoever obtains first-hand information will be set for life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yohan, this is the opportunity of a lifetime! I thought I'd bring you in on this because of our past, and you should be grateful. But instead, you're opposing me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yohan bristled with indignation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The patient is still alive! This isn't research; it's murder. I won't allow it. If you insist, I'll report this."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul sneered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Report it? Are you out of your mind? This is the Red Umbrella Group we're talking about. You think reporting it will help? Her life is worth less than a single strand of their hair."</span></p><div class="pagination">
