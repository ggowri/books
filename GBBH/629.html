  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Karl regretted it immediately after he finished speaking, afraid that Bruno would chop off his head with the machete.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bruno, don't you want to fulfill your mother's last wish?" Karl asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bruno helped Mafia kill so many people just to fulfill his mother's last wish.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He snorted coldly and said, "Go back and tell Brandon that I will fulfill my mother's last wish. But I will not join the Mafia, nor will I recognize him as my uncle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't care about returning to the family or becoming one of the successors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Killing Alexander is the last thing I will do for you. I hope Brandon won't deceive me. Otherwise, I will chop off his head."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bruno was filled with murderous intent, and the temperature in the room suddenly dropped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Karl couldn't help but shiver. "Bruno, you'd better respect Godfather. Otherwise, you will suffer."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get out! If you don't go now, I'll chop off your head." Bruno looked at Karl coldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Karl was so scared that he took a few steps back. Then he turned around and ran away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The room fell silent. Bruno's eyes were filled with sadness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He walked to the urn and stroked it gently. "Mom, I will fulfill your last wish and let you be buried in the family cemetery. No one will look down on you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feeling sad in his heart, Bruno burst into tears and cried loudly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His mother, Richel, was the eldest daughter of the Hawkins family, and she was Brandon's sister.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Richel fell in love with an ordinary man. Despite her family's opposition, she married Bruno's father.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the end, Richel was expelled from the family, and Bruno's father died.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bruno had never seen what his father looked like. He and his mother wandered the streets, struggling for survival.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To raise Bruno, Richel gave up her dignity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She begged along the streets and did many kinds of work. She washed cars, picked up trash, washed dishes in a small restaurant, and did anything that could make money.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sometimes, to protect Bruno, Richel even had to endure insults from men.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those were dark days for them, and Richel was tortured badly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she never backed down. She just wanted to do her best to raise Bruno.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To keep Bruno alive and raise him, Richel paid too much price.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since Bruno was young, he knew his mother's hard work and helplessness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those painful memories flashed through Bruno's mind like a movie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His heart was filled with anger, longing, and sadness, which made him wish he could die now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To take care of Bruno, Richel worked so hard that she was not only malnourished but even exhausted to the point of vomiting blood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On a bad day with heavy rain, it was Bruno's sixth birthday.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Richel, who worked in a restaurant, cleaned up some of the guests' leftover food. Then she bought pizza and cake to celebrate Bruno's birthday.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After the restaurant closed, they celebrated Bruno's birthday in the kitchen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Richel sang a song to Bruno, and they ate cake and pizza happily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this time, the hostess with a fierce face came and insulted them, calling them thieves who stole the cakes and pizzas in the store.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Richel explained, "Miss, I paid the money. You can check the account. We won't steal your things. Please don't slander us."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The hostess slapped Bruno to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The host also came over, grabbing the broom and hitting Bruno hard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Richel quickly threw herself on Bruno and used her body to protect Bruno.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How dare you steal my things! I'll beat you to death!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The host wielded a broom and beat Richel hard, leaving red and swollen marks on her body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bruno cried out, "Stop hitting my mother. Please. We didn't steal it. We bought it..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The host and his wife beat Richel even harder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Richel wailed and held Bruno in her arms, desperately to protect him, letting them beat her.</span></p><div class="pagination">
