We must be careful."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Mafia was already vindictive in the first place, let alone being humiliated in front of so many people.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Whatever. Come as they may, and I'll slay them all!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smiled confidently and continued to stride forward while admiring the exotic scenery on both sides of the road.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, Alexander stopped and stretched out his arms to stop Xavier and Alice behind him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A dozen people rushed over from all directions to them, like a pack of wolves sieging their prey.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those ferocious men in uniform camouflage combat uniforms each held a submachine gun that aimed at Alexander and the other two.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were simply so outrageous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's go!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hugging Alice with one hand and grabbing Xavier's arm with the other, Alexander turned around and rushed into an alley.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their enemies outnumbered them and were armed with automatic weapons.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although this was not even an intimidation to Alexander, if a fight really broke out, Alice and Xavier would definitely be in danger, especially Xavier, who was mediocre at fighting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he reacted to the threats so swiftly, those armed men were stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their original plan was to encircle them and shoot them all; it was a very secure plan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Alexander anticipated their tactics and ran away with his companions in advance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By the time the dozen or so Mafia shooters realized his escape, Alexander had already led the two men to run dozens of meters away and still kept speeding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, shoot them!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Someone anxiously gave orders.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, the sound of gunshots broke out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>More than a dozen submachine guns were pointed at Alexander, and they put the whole street in the shower of bullets regardless of the innocent people's safety.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To avoid the bullets, the traffic on the street was in chaos.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It offered Alexander a good chance to cover them in the flood of the cars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the face of the indiscriminate fire from fully automatic weapons, traffic was clearly the best cover.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne, you're so swift."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alice was surprised. Being held in Alexander's arms, she felt like she was flying as she moved flexibly among the traffic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Things might not be so pleasant for Xavier. After all, Alexander only dragged him to shuttle back and forth between the cars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was keen on drag racing with his pals since the unlimited speed could bring him delight. But never did he experience such horrifying speed and swerve.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the chaos, Alexander was both fast and nimble, just like a fish in the water, and easily dodged the bullets.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>More than a dozen submachine guns were still firing intensively.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The terrifying shower of bullets was so dense that they forced a black Rolls-Royce to stop on the side of the road.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't kill me! I'm just a driver! Please don't kill me, please..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The driver opened the car door and rushed out, shouting for mercy as he ran away crawling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Rolls-Royce was left there, and there seemed to be a woman sitting in the back seat of the vehicle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without any hesitation, Alexander stuffed Alice and Xavier into the car and then sat in the driver's seat himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who are you?" The woman in the backseat asked seriously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Turning around his head, Alexander saw a stunning woman in her late twenties who was dressed sexy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander said calmly, "Excuse me, can I borrow your car for a while?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite her slight nervousness, she didn't yell for help but fixed her eyes on him, looking surprisingly calm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander squinted his eyes and could tell she was not an ordinary person.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now was not the time to probe into her identity. Alexander shifted gears and stepped on the accelerator. As the engine roared, the car rushed out like a steel beast.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those Mafia shooters failed to catch up with them and could only watch their targets disappear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Idiot! How can you let them get away?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paxton hysterically yelled at his subordinates.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked somewhat similar to Ian but was like a fiercer version of him. Anyone could tell his cruelty at first sight of him.</span></p><div class="pagination">
