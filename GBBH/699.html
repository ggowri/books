Instead of taking it, Alexander's team had to clear each floor using the stairwell.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each level was guarded by the Red Umbrella Group's elite forces, but these small fries weren't worth Alexander's effort. Shadow and Rosalia made quick work of them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The slaughter continued as they descended. The stairwell transformed into a bloody path to hell, littered with bodies sprawled in every direction, blood flowing freely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander soon reached the lowest level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Red Umbrella Group's control room was located here. It was their most crucial facility.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>BOOM!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's sword sliced through the control room's blast-proof door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The reinforced door, designed to withstand rocket attacks, was cut through like butter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The entire floor began to shake as an eerie, supernatural presence filled the underground space from above.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's expression turned grave. The evil force was about to descend.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill them!" Shadow yelled, leading the charge into the control room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Over a hundred members of the Red Umbrella Group screamed and scattered in panic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Some tried to draw their weapons but were cut down before they could even pull the trigger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Strangely, Felix and Rock were nowhere to be found.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a wave of his hand, Alexander signaled his men to storm in and round up everyone from the Red Umbrella Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You've got nowhere to run now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shadow ordered his men to bring a large package of remote-controlled explosives, which they placed strategically around the area.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The combined blast would be powerful enough to send the Red Umbrella Group's headquarters sky-high.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Whatever Felix and Rock were up to, they'd be nothing but ashes after an explosion of this magnitude.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The ground trembled with increasing intensity, making the entire control room shake.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander gestured to his men. "Everyone </span><span>clear</span><span> out now. We detonate in five minutes!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill them!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A rage-filled battle cry suddenly pierced the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hana appeared, half his body covered in blood, swinging a broken katana as he lunged viciously at Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander dodged effortlessly and asked in an icy tone, "Where's Felix?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hana's teeth ground together audibly as he snarled, "I'll kill you all! One's worth my trouble, two's a bonus!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He swung his blade again, launching another desperate attack at Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're asking for it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander didn't even bother using his Lightsabers. Instead, he struck out with his bare fist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His </span><span>fist</span><span> collided violently with Hana's broken katana.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The blade shattered into countless pieces. The explosive force sent the fragments flying back into Hana's body, instantly riddling him with dozens of bleeding wounds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despair and agony twisted Hana's features. He'd retreated underground after being wounded by Augusta, only to end up even worse off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fuck!" he roared furiously, lunging at Alexander again like a rabid monster.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander, tired of the confrontation, struck Hana across the face with devastating force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A scream pierced the air as Hana flew backward, coughing up blood before crashing to the ground, motionless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A close inspection would reveal Hana's completely shattered jaw and caved-in face. He was dead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one would believe that a top-tier assassin from the </span><span>Risun</span><span> Sakra Society could be killed with just one slap from Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander gestured sharply. "Everyone out, now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shadow, Rosalia, and Charlize didn't dare argue, rushing toward the stairwell.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Halfway up, a dark figure suddenly blocked their path.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Rock!" Shadow gasped, shocked to find their escape route ambushed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, well, well. Been waiting for you folks," Rock sneered. "None of you are leaving. You'll all become sacrifices for the Great Being.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You thought destroying the outer array would stop us? Dead wrong!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rock let out a sinister laugh as he opened the Ancient Grimoire, chanting under his breath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The control room rumbled as a massive pentagram materialized, blazing with light and flames.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix descended from the ceiling, landing in the center of the array, fixing Alexander with a murderous glare.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shadow immediately pulled out the detonator.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Move it, old man, or we all go up in flames together."</span></p><div class="pagination">
