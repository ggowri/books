  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fernando Cobb, the base commander, never saw the attack coming.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He'd just wrapped up an intense "session" with two women and was trying to get some rest when the raid rudely interrupted his good time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That really got under his skin, and his bloodlust was starting to boil over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill them all!" he roared. "I don't care who these raiders are&mdash;take them out with everything we've got!" Fernando charged forward like an enraged lion, his men falling in behind him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, well... looks like we found </span><span>their</span><span> </span><span>base commander," Quentin said with a cold smirk as he watched Fernando barreling toward them like a madman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who the hell are you people?" Fernando's tough act faltered when he got a good look at Quentin's crew. These weren't your average raiders&mdash;these guys were elite operators, and Fernando knew he was in deep trouble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Sakra Society thinks they can just set up a secret base in </span><span>Newbrook</span><span> without our permission?" Quentin's voice dripped with contempt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Did you really think we wouldn't notice your little operation? That we'd just let it slide?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He leveled his gaze at Fernando. "Hand over the pure Immortality Serum, and maybe&mdash;just maybe&mdash;I'll let you walk away from this."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fernando's face twisted into an ugly grin, his eyes blazing with fury. "</span><span>You</span><span> pieces of trash think you deserve the pure Immortality Serum? Keep dreaming!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander stepped forward, fixing Fernando with an icy stare. "Since you won't cooperate, I'll have to do this my way. Trust me. You'll talk eventually."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He strode toward Fernando with the kind of confidence that made everyone hold their breath. The air around him practically crackled with deadly intent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What the hell?" Fernando's tough guy act faltered for a split second as he picked up on Alexander's menacing vibe. This was going to be a fight for survival.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fernando glared at Alexander, demanding, "Hey, young man, are you running this </span><span>little operation?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Alexander could answer, Jonah and his men burst out from the sides, weapons ready. "On your knees, Fernando!" Jonah barked. "Or we shoot to kill!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His metahuman squad charged in like predators going after prey, cutting down Fernando's men with brutal efficiency.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't get cocky," Fernando roared, pulling out his saber. "You want the pure Immortality Serum? You'll have to get through my knife first."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With nothing left to lose, Fernando went for broke.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The saber flashed through the air in a deadly arc, slicing clean across a metahuman's throat. Blood sprayed like a burst pipe as the Level Two metahuman clutched his neck and crumpled to the ground. Just like that, Fernando had taken one of them out with a single strike.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quentin stood there stunned. He hadn't expected Fernando to be this powerful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Fernando lunged forward with his saber again, sporting a twisted grin, Alexander barked out. "That's enough!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander sprang into action, closing the distance between them in a flash as he reached for Fernando's saber.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was no doubt about it&mdash;Fernando had to be another test subject jacked up on enhancement drugs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His </span><span>blade skill</span><span>, speed, and raw power were seriously impressive&mdash;easily on par with a level-four metahuman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he saw Alexander trying to grab his blade bare-handed, Fernando let out a cold laugh. "Are you crazy? Looking to lose those fingers?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fernando's saber sliced through the air with a sharp whistle as he thrust it straight at Alexander's chest, moving so fast it literally made the air scream.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead of drawing his Lightsabers, Alexander simply pressed his index and middle fingers together and touched them to the blade of the saber.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The military-grade steel saber&mdash;the kind that's supposed to be practically indestructible&mdash;snapped clean in half the moment it met Alexander's fingers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What the hell are you?" Fernando's face went pale as he scrambled backward, wildly swinging his broken blade in a desperate attempt to keep Alexander from closing in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's pointless. I've already taken down several of your test subjects. Your resistance is like bringing a knife to a gunfight. It was completely useless."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander moved like a shadow, his fingers dancing through the air as he unleashed invisible blades of Force energy. Each strike was like a phantom sword, precise and deadly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The devastating assault shattered Fernando's broken </span><span>blade</span><span> </span><span>before slamming into his chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blood sprayed everywhere as the attacks punched clean through his body, leaving gaping wounds one could see straight through.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fernando crashed to the ground with a sickening thud, his eyes wide with disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't accept that he'd been defeated so easily, and he glared at Alexander with pure hatred and resentment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, tell me where the pure Immortality Serum is," Alexander demanded, standing </span><span>over Fernando's broken form.</span></p><div class="pagination">
