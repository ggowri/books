  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The girl was Erica Simone. She dismounted the steed and looked out at the village dozens of feet away, which was billowing with thick smoke. In the village, there were only black rubble and charred trees.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Erica walked into the village. The place was in a complete mess. There were many corpses on both sides of the road. The men had broken bodies. The women were naked. Their eyes wide opened. There were some children's bodies among these corpses. They small bodies twisted into strange shapes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it! Those hateful Risunese." Erica's face flushed as she cursed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Erica gradually calmed down, holding the silver cross on her chest with both hands and murmuring, "Father, you are the source of our lives. You have called him back from this world. Please forgive all his past transgressions, and grant him a place in the heavenly abode, where he can enjoy peace and happiness forever."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, Erica looked up, her blue eyes shining with sharp and piercing light as she stared towards the south. "Such a powerful demonic aura!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the southern sky, a figure wrapped in blue-silver flames shot out and then collided with a sudden dazzling scarlet air-wave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a bang, the figure flickering with dim blue-silver flames crashed down in front of the village like a meteor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a dull thud, a huge, bottomless circular pit appeared on the solid ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your little ring is quite interesting." Frieza's weird laughter sounded. "It's been a long time since I've had this much fun. It's getting late. I'll send you to hell."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Frieza raised his hand in mid-air, with a dazzling red light at his fingertips, preparing to strike and end Alexander's life with one blow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who's that?" Frieza suddenly pointed at the village billowing with thick smoke. A scarlet light-column shot out, and a huge light-explosion flashed. The rubble, charred trees, and huge stones all vaporized in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Lord says that all evil will be purified!" A clear voice rang out. Erica walked out of the thick smoke.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She held the silver cross on her chest tightly with both hands, lowered her head, and closed her eyes slightly, muttering, "Gracious Lord, please grant your knight Erica Simone, the power to purify evil. Silver Cloth!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, the melody of divine grace sounded. The intense holy light burst out from the silver-white cross. The light was pure and dazzling, enveloping Erica.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, the holy light gradually dimmed and finally disappeared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Erica's linen tube dress had disappeared. A set of dazzling silver-colored and magnificent battle armor covered her whole body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wore a silver-colored circular helmet with a galloping flying steed in the middle of the helmet, looking beautiful and lively.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the silver shoulder guards were engraved crosses, and the deep V-shaped breastplate covered her plump breasts. The silver gloves covered her forearms and palms, and the gloves were engraved with complicated and holy divine patterns, faintly shining with holy light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Below was a silver-colored protective skirt, highlighting Erica's round and firm buttocks. She had lean legs and wore a pair of silver-colored hollow knee-high battle boots.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The entire set of battle armor was inlaid with dotted and glittering holy stones, like stars, overflowing with holy light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, a blue-silver light-column shot up into the air from the deep pit and then landed with a thud.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This human-shaped figure was hardly recognizable as Alexander. His hair was disheveled. His eyes were swollen and red, and his facial features were distorted. His upper body was naked, with two big holes in his chest. The internal organs could be seen faintly. His lower abdomen was a mass of bloody mess, and a piece of muscle was missing from his right leg. Blood was gushing out all over his body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander took out a bottle of Divine Liquid and took a big gulp. He turned his head, narrowed his swollen eyes, and looked at Erica, thinking, "This woman has quite a powerful combat power. But Frieza..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander composed himself and said to Erica, "Go. You're no match for him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Erica frowned and clenched her fists. She looked solemn and holy, and her voice was firm. "All evil will be purified."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Frieza crossed his arms over his chest and burst out laughing. "Beauty, you look quite good in that outfit, but I've never been one to show mercy to pretty women."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Erica couldn't help but sneer, a hint of contempt flashing in her beautiful eyes. Extremely pure holy flames rose from her body, like a dreamy mist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She stepped forward and raised her arms in front of her chest. Her hands were like eagle claws, making several mysterious and graceful gestures. Her left hand stopped in front of her chest, and her right fist made a fierce strike towards Frieza from a distance. She shouted, "Meteor Fist!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
