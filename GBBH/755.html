  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, this was the headquarters of the Ultimate Alliance. Alexander's challenge to a one-on-one duel was more than ideal for Bruno.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, don't you dare run!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bruno pursued him swiftly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before anyone could fully register their movements, Alexander and Bruno had vanished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are they both that fast?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop doubting. Our boss will win for sure!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Charlize's tone was resolute, but her heart was filled with worry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander and Bruno raced towards the outskirts of Loscity, dashing through the streets like gusts of wind, causing a commotion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, they reached a secluded path in the suburbs of Loscity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The area was lush with vegetation and rarely frequented by people.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They entered a quiet grove by the roadside, stopping almost simultaneously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander remained calm, his breathing steady as he leisurely observed Bruno.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bruno, on the other hand, was slightly out of breath, his chest heaving from the sprint.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander wore a teasing smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bruno couldn't withstand Alexander's piercing gaze, feeling a chill down his spine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He drew his blade. The blood-red machete was unsheathed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander remained still, intrigued by Bruno and his blade.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bruno roared, stomping the ground with force. The impact caused the solid earth to cave in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The powerful reaction propelled Bruno towards Alexander like a bullet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the next moment, Bruno appeared right in front of Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander casually sidestepped, moving to Bruno's flank.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Bruno seemed to float as if weightless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He appeared to be drawn to Alexander, moving slowly. In reality, his speed was so fast that it was beyond the grasp of ordinary people.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A blood-red blade of light appeared, slicing towards Alexander's throat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander didn't use his Lightsaber. Instead, he punched out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His fist was enveloped in the Force, creating an incredibly tough protective shield.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The last time, Alexander had shattered Bruno's blade with a single punch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The fist collided with the machete, and this time, the blade didn't break.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bruno was thrown back by the force, snapping a small tree.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander swayed but remained standing firm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the ground beneath his feet cracked, spreading out like a spider's web.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just the aftermath of their clash was this powerful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clearly, their strength and speed had far surpassed ordinary humans, even </span><span>meta-humans</span><span>, demonstrating the terrifying potential of human capabilities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bruno launched another attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He leaped like a ferocious tiger and swooped down like a nimble eagle, raising his blade high above his head and slashing down toward Alexander's skull.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The red blade of light seemed like a waterfall descending from the heavens, intending to split Alexander in half from top to bottom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander stood his ground. This time, instead of using his fist, he drew his Lightsaber.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A dazzling white light flared, blocking the bloodied blade.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a faint sound, the Lightsaber effortlessly severed the machete.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bruno retreated in shock, staring at his broken blade in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's going on? My blade was made of tungsten steel. How could it break so easily!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander ignored him and thrust his Lightsaber.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The blinding sword light almost prevented Bruno from opening his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He dodged with lightning speed but didn't entirely escape the Lightsaber, and his left arm was severed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, Bruno hurled his broken blade at Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The distance was too close. Alexander didn't expect Bruno to forgo dodging and instead opt for a mutually destructive move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The broken blade grazed Alexander's shoulder, blood immediately flowing down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander let the blood drip to the ground, staring at Bruno with cold eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bruno clutched his severed arm. He knew he had lost.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the instincts of a wild beast, he knew he couldn't avoid that sword thrust, so he chose to inflict some damage in return.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Alexander was too fast. In the end, Bruno lost an arm, while Alexander was only scratched.</span></p><div class="pagination">
