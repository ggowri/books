  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander! </span><span>So</span><span> it's you..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Madelyn looked at Alexander in surprise, her expression a mix of shock and delight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smiled and shook her hand,</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My dear old classmate, I didn't expect to run into you here. Have you come back from studying abroad?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, I just returned not long ago. I can't believe I'd see you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Madelyn held Alexander's hand tightly, her excitement making her breath quicken.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were high school classmates, not only desk mates but had also harbored feelings for each other, though they never officially became a couple, they had shared some flirty moments.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Later, Madelyn was sent abroad to study law, and they lost touch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, what case are you handling? I'll help you for free!" Madelyn asked with concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smiled wryly and explained what had happened between him and Jane.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I managed to get back ten million for her, but she's suing me for fraud&mdash;totally unreasonable."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After hearing Alexander's story, Madelyn was furious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your ex-wife is outrageous! She cheated first, abandoned your daughter, and forced you into divorce. Now she wants to extort your money&mdash;what a vile person!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry, Alexander. She's slandering you and has no evidence. We'll definitely win this case, and I can scare her off without even going to court."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smiled and said, "Then I'll rely on you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No need to worry; our firm has extensive connections. This is a minor issue. As for the lawyer's fees, let's forget about it; I'll do it for free."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Madelyn assessed Alexander, clearly doubting he could have five hundred million dollars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Alexander had that much money, why would Jane, a gold digger, divorce him?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander looked at Madelyn gratefully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You don't need to waive my fees. I'm very satisfied with your services; I expect payment at the firm's highest rates!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Huh? The highest rates? That's over a thousand dollars an hour, and if it's less than an hour, it's billed as an hour."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Madelyn was stunned&mdash;was this old classmate really clueless?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander chuckled and asked, "What's wrong? Do you think I can't afford it, or do you think you're not worth that price?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jenson mocked. "Do you really think you're someone who can afford it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander ignored him and patted Madelyn's arm, saying, "I'm hiring you as my personal lawyer, and you'll handle the arrangement for that five hundred million in </span><span>assets."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Huh? Do you really have five hundred million in assets?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Madelyn stared at Alexander in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jenson rolled his eyes dismissively.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop bragging! I don't believe you have five hundred million dollars. I've seen billionaires, but I've never seen anyone as poor as you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madelyn, I suspect he came here just to trick you because he knew you were interning here; he's definitely up to no good."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander acted as if he hadn't heard a word, pulling out his phone to show Madelyn the asset documents Miguel had sent him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madelyn, here are the documents for assets worth a total of five hundred million dollars. I need you to help me process the transfer officially into my name."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Madelyn looked at the scanned legal documents, her beautiful eyes wide with shock, her mind racing even more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wait, you really have that much in assets? And it's being transferred from the Federer family?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jenson's face had turned grim, unable to suppress his curiosity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Federer family? Which Federer family?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Madelyn replied, her tone complicated, "Which other Federer family could it be? The Federer family, the most powerful of the four families in </span><span>Loscity</span><span>! They're valued at a minimum of five hundred million dollars, but it's actually worth much more."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jenson couldn't help but tremble in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He slapped his forehead, his face a mix of astonishment and regret. He realized he had missed out on a genuine billionaire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madelyn, you didn't make a mistake, did you? Are these documents legitimate?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jenson leaned in closer, staring intently at the phone screen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The more he looked, the paler he became; he had handed off a top client to Madelyn, costing himself at least six figures a year.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Madelyn stared blankly at Alexander, murmuring, "I can't believe you're an invisible billionaire. You were just pretending to be low-key in high school, weren't you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I didn't expect you were a hidden rich man. You deliberately kept a low profile in high school, right?"</span></p><div class="pagination">
