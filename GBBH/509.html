  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Danielle opened her eyes to find Felix, that demon, grabbing her chest, roughly squeezing as waves of pain shot through her. She couldn't stop herself from crying out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No... please, don't touch me! I have a husband!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not long ago, she had been the captain of a well-known mercenary team, and now she'd become this man's plaything. This was worse than a nightmare.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Smack!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix slapped her hard and yelled, "Shut up and behave, or I'll kill your husband and child!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Danielle's face went pale with fear, and she didn't dare to resist anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix sneered, unzipping his pants and forcing Danielle's head down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Red Umbrella Group was in crisis, and with no military support, Felix's mood was foul.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wanted to issue a high-stakes bounty, but the military, as the major shareholder, had flatly refused, leaving Felix seething and in need of an outlet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If things continued this way, Felix would have to turn to the Vanderbilt family for help.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His mother was indeed from the Vanderbilt family in the Capital Region, but that </span><span>family valued sons over daughters, and they had never cared much about his mother.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't until he became chairman of the Red Umbrella Group and built close ties with the military that the Vanderbilt family finally accepted him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix was nominally a Vanderbilt, but his uncles and cousins were likely waiting for him to beg for help, ready to squeeze every benefit out of him at the smallest cost.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Frustrated, Felix could only vent his anger on Danielle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, a voice full of excitement came from outside, "Mr. Vanderbilt... Great news! Mr. Wallace agreed to send troops to protect us and wants to meet you at the hotel."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One of the guards ran in, excitedly reporting the news while staring greedily at Danielle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Good!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix was overjoyed. If the </span><span>Kingsdon</span><span> District's forces could be sent, the threat of that bounty would be greatly reduced.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew Alexander wouldn't let him go, but as long as he was in the </span><span>Kingsdon</span><span>, he was confident he could handle him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lucky for you, you get a break. But when I get back, you'll pay!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix shoved her roughly, and Danielle gagged a few times.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Felix hurried out of the basement, Danielle felt her strength drain away, collapsing in despair on the floor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Francis had arranged to meet Felix at the Grand Court Hotel, with dozens of special forces guarding the place under tight security.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The rotating restaurant on the top floor of the hotel was opulently luxurious, akin to a seven-star setting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The gilded walls sparkled with embedded gems and pearls, reflecting light in dazzling hues.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Persian carpet beneath was intricately woven with gold threads, an extravagance that took one's breath away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Francis sat confidently at a massive dining table. With the entire restaurant reserved, he was the only guest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The commander of the </span><span>Kingsdon</span><span> District, a four-star general, was much younger than Quentin. In his forties, he was strong and well-kept.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Francis wore gold-rimmed glasses, adding an air of cultured elegance, as though he were a well-educated scholar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Many who first met Francis thought he was a kind-hearted, well-educated general devoted to his country and integrity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the truth was harsh. No one could imagine the ruthless intent hidden behind Francis' friendly smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Heh..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Francis thought of Felix's dire situation and couldn't suppress a dark smile. His chance had arrived.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For Felix to get out of this mess, he'd have to pay the price; otherwise, Francis wouldn't lift a finger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Besides Francis, a man in his thirties was standing nearby, wearing sunglasses and a </span><span>black trench coat, exuding a cool and mysterious air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His expression was cold, with his right hand casually in his pocket and a sharp glint in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anyone who had been on the battlefield could tell at a glance. This man was tough to handle. He exuded the intimidating presence of a human weapon.</span></p><div class="pagination">
