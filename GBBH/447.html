  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander, however, remained calm, unaffected by the high temperature.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Another day and night passed. Under the influence of Force Burning, the hilt and the gem finally fused perfectly together.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The hilt radiated a gold and silver light, with Esoteric Patterns emerging and shining, very cool.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander exhaled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The first-level Lightsaber was finally crafted. This oval hilt was, in fact, a magical Lightsaber.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander immediately wanted to test whether the power of the Lightsaber was as formidable as in sci-fi movies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a light flick of his hand, a white beam suddenly emerged from the hilt. Silver and gold lights intertwined, extremely gorgeous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In his excitement, Alexander swung his hand casually.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The tool cabinet opposite, like a frail blade of grass, was cut in half by a single strike.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sawdust flew everywhere. Whether it was a hammer, or a wrench, or even a jack, everything the Lightsaber touched was severed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, a deep sword mark appeared on the wall, terrifyingly profound.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Cool!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was very satisfied. Although it was a first-level Lightsaber, it did not disappoint him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With this Lightsaber, Alexander was confident in withstanding modern heavy weapon fire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if a shell flew over, he could instantly cut it in half.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ordinary light armored vehicles would be sliced open by the Lightsaber.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If facing a main battle tank, Alexander estimated he would need to upgrade the Lightsaber to level two.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But upgrading to a second-level Lightsaber required a large number of top-grade gems to enhance the energy core. Although Alexander now had funds and manpower, it would also take time to collect top-grade gems.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Top-grade gems were not something he could buy on a whim. He might secure some quickly if going to gem mines.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Alexander contemplated upgrading the Lightsaber, he contentedly prepared to leave the basement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He checked the time. It was now the evening of the third day of his seclusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander eagerly opened the door and immediately saw Ava, Alice, Betty, and Rosalia. They all looked exhausted, their faces etched with deep worry and anxiety.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's wrong? What happened?" Alexander asked immediately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava said with guilt, "Ashley! Ashley was kidnapped by the Red Umbrella Group... They demand we hand over the magic powder formula and want you to exchange hostages personally."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What! Where was Charlize? What was she doing?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was shocked, and his anger flared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alice quickly explained, "Charlize was severely injured by Kyle from the Red Umbrella Group and is being treated in the hospital. Kyle is a metahuman cultivated by the Red Umbrella Group, possessing terrifying fire power."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A murderous intent burst in Alexander's eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Where is Kyle?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alice said without hesitation, "Pegasus Club!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without a word, Alexander strode out, with Ava and the others following closely behind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander ordered, "You all wait outside later. Don't let anyone escape."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, dozens of black cars streamed out, speeding towards the Pegasus Club.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Pegasus Club was one of the most upscale clubs in </span><span>Loscity</span><span>, with a strong background.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, few people knew that the Pegasus Club was backed by the Red Umbrella Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tonight, Kyle was entertaining a group of shady friends at the Pegasus Club.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Red Umbrella Group dares to kidnap my daughter. They're courting death!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander could no longer contain himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was already nine in the evening, the prime time for nightlife.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Pegasus Club was ablaze with lights, with luxury cars filling the entrance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rolls-Royces, Bentleys, Ferraris, and other luxury cars seemed like the cheapest low-end goods here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop! Who are you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Alexander stepped onto the stairs of the Pegasus Club, he was blocked by several burly men.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were strong and ugly, their faces twisted with a murderous aura, clearly men who were used to killing. They were all elites of the Red Umbrella Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get lost or die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander didn't bother wasting time with these minions and simply waved his hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A terrifying Force erupted. Those burly men flew backward more than ten feet as if hit by a speeding tank.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each had a distinct handprint on their face, swollen and red, strikingly conspicuous.</span></p><div class="pagination">
