  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander pulled his Porsche to the side, letting the other car overtake him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When the Lamborghini was alongside the Porsche, the driver flashed Alexander a middle finger with a sneer, cursing as he sped by.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's him! That's Byron, the Clifford family's young master. What is he trying to pull?" Rebecca snapped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rebecca held back the urge to curse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, the Lamborghini sped up and swerved in front of Alexander's Porsche, moving side to side like a crab, blocking the entire road on purpose.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rebecca's Porsche didn't stand a chance against the Lamborghini when it came to handling or horsepower.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, Alexander, the world's last Warrior, was the one driving.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Any other driver facing this kind of aggressive taunting from the Lamborghini would probably have lost control by now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander didn't even blink, keeping a steady grip on the steering wheel and controlling his speed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, inside, a fierce anger had begun to ignite.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His piercing gaze sharpened with rage. Byron had not only tried to force Rebecca into marriage but was now pulling stunts on the road to provoke him. He was asking for it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, the Lamborghini slammed on its brakes wildly; fortunately, Alexander reacted quickly, barely avoiding a collision.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Watch out! That guy is a complete jerk!" Rebecca screamed, her face turning pale.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Byron pulled up beside Alexander again, whistling at Rebecca and taunting, "Rebecca, you're my woman. What are you doing in some other guy's passenger seat?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Backed by his status as the Clifford family's young master and a professional racer, his arrogance was boundless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Pull over now, or I'll make you regret it," Byron shouted at Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander rolled his eyes and closed the window without a word.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fuck, just wait!" Byron cursed, furious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you think you can challenge me? I'll make sure you crash today!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Byron stomped on the accelerator, and the Lamborghini's twin-turbo engine roared like an arrow shot from a bow, once again cutting off Alexander's Porsche.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander quickly turned the wheel, maneuvering the Porsche sharply and narrowly </span><span>avoiding the crash.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Due to the sudden inertia, Rebecca lurched forward, only to be pulled back by her seatbelt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Furious, her face turned red. "That guy is infuriating!" she exclaimed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Lamborghini pulled the same trick again, slowing in front of the Porsche and swerving left and right, braking randomly in an obvious attempt to force Alexander to stop.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was indeed a professional racer. His driving was flawless, and he executed his cheap tricks effortlessly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From his perspective, Alexander's Porsche and driving skills were no match for his; he expected Alexander to submit soon enough.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hahaha!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Byron laughed loudly, extending his middle finger out the window in another taunt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, what should we do? We can't let him get away with this," Rebecca asked, frustrated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Buckle up and hold on tight. If he wants to play, then I'll give him a game. You're in a Porsche; he's in a Lamborghini," Alexander replied with a cold grin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander told Rebecca to brace herself, a cold smile spreading across his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rebecca quickly gripped the handle with both hands, her expression tense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry. I'll make him regret it," Alexander assured her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's gaze locked onto the Lamborghini in front, his eyes flashing as he activated his All-seeing Eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instantly, he could see the Lamborghini's speed, trajectory, and every possible turn and angle it might take.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even the tiniest pebbles on the road, the wind speed, the Porsche's momentum, and potential collision angles appeared clearly in his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thanks to his powerful mental abilities, hundreds of crash scenarios played out instantly in Alexander's mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He selected the simplest and most direct plan, minimizing his own risk while ensuring maximum damage to his opponent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the Lamborghini swerved recklessly once more, a sharp gleam crossed Alexander's eyes, and he shouted, "Hold on tight!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rebecca gripped the handle as tightly as she could.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander slammed on the gas, channeling a surge of Force energy through all four wheels.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Porsche's powerful engine roared, combining with the Force to send all four wheels into a sudden burst of speed.</span></p><div class="pagination">
