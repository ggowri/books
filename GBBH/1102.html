  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander paused for a moment, pushing aside the lingering frustration. A smile returned to his face as he glanced at the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Creek!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The study door slowly opened, and Charlize slipped inside, moving with the eagerness of a devoted follower. Without a word, she leaned into his embrace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A shiver ran through her as Alexander's fingers lightly traced her skin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A subtle sound echoed as Charlize began to unzip her leather jacket.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The black leather slid off, revealing her pale, alluring form, the fabric gliding away like peeling skin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The next morning, just as dawn broke, the sharp ring of the doorbell jolted Alexander awake.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Rosalia's voice came from the other side of the door. "Mr. Hawthorne, Grace has arrived."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ava, frowning and curling her lip in distaste, muttered, "She's here for you, isn't she? I don't like her. Go see what she wants."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With a nod, Alexander donned his robe and made his way downstairs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Is there something you need?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Alexander, I finally found you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Grace's face lit up with a smile as bright as a blooming flower, her cool, elegant demeanor softening. She stepped forward, looking almost relieved at his presence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What's so urgent that you came so early?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander's voice was calm, almost indifferent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He wasn't thrilled to see Grace&mdash;not after the last time, when she'd tried to manipulate Ava into leaving him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her face paled at his cold reception, and she hesitated before speaking seriously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Alexander, my grandfather's condition has worsened. It's critical, and he's on the brink of death!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What? That's impossible!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander was shocked. He had already treated Gavin, and though he hadn't fully healed, his condition shouldn't have deteriorated so soon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But seeing Grace's urgency and the fact that she had come to him so early made it clear that something was seriously wrong.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'll come with you," he said. "But I'll bet there's more to this than you're telling me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Grace nodded eagerly, and her relief was palpable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Minutes later, a sleek black military helicopter touched down on the lawn outside the mansion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The blades kicked up dust as they made their way inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ava stood by the window, watching the helicopter fade into the distance, her expression unreadable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the helicopter, Alexander gazed out at the passing scenery while his mind churned. He still couldn't figure out the mystery of the low-level energy cores needed for his Lightsabers upgrade. What exactly were they?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Grace, sensing his distraction and knowing the urgency of the situation, chose not to speak. They flew in silence, the tension between them palpable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They soon arrived at a sprawling estate in the countryside&mdash;a mansion set in picturesque surroundings. The air was crisp, and the peaceful hum of nature contrasted sharply with the urgency of their mission.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander, unreadable as ever, followed Grace through the gates and toward the mansion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Grace glanced at him nervously, forcing a smile. "We're almost there, Alexander. Please, you have to help my grandfather."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander nodded, his senses alert.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He could feel the presence of hidden guards all around them. The estate was heavily protected, which was no surprise given Gavin's status as one of Avalora's top figures.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon, they approached the grand entrance, where dozens of people had gathered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Men and women, impeccably dressed, stood in anxious clusters, whispering among themselves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was clear they were all members of the Lawson family&mdash;wealthy, influential, and powerful, with several well-known faces among them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The murmurs died down as they watched Grace lead Alexander through without any resistance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Wait a minute! Ms. Grace Lawson is personally guiding this young man? Who is he? Just like that, he gets to go in?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I've never seen him before. No idea who he is."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"That's Alexander&mdash;the one who supposedly cured Sir Lawson last time. But now Sir Lawson's condition is even worse. This time, he's definitely in for trouble."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The murmurs of the crowd reached Alexander's ears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His expression remained unchanged, as if he hadn't heard a word. Calmly, he followed Grace across the hall and into a charming courtyard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Wait!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Suddenly, several armed guards emerged from the shadows, blocking their path.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What's going on? Step aside!" Grace snapped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Alexander, unphased, smiled slightly. "It's fine. Let them do their check."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He spread his arms out, completely calm as the guards moved in to inspect him.</span></p><div class="pagination">
