  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What the hell is this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Augusta snapped, his eyes wide as he scanned his surroundings, sensing danger closing in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's fight our way out!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He burst into a full sprint, but no matter how hard he pushed, he kept spinning in circles, stuck in the same spot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The black mist grew thicker until he couldn't see his hand in front of his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their advantage was slipping away fast. Everyone who had entered the plaza was now trapped in the dark fog, wholly cut off from their teammates.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Augusta panicked and quickly contacted Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Boss, this formation is seriously powerful. We're trapped and can't break free. What should we do?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stay calm. I'll step in and get you out," Alexander replied coolly, instantly boosting Augusta's confidence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Rock's formation is incomplete and full of holes. While it can trap you guys, it can't hold me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Once I destroy the formation, hit the Red Umbrella Group with everything you've got. No prisoners. Show no mercy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, sir!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Augusta could only wait anxiously in place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Alexander appeared in the center of the Demon Summoning Array like a bolt of lightning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before him stood a pillar as thick as a thigh. The ghostly white column radiated waves of bone-chilling energy, with wisps of black mist seeping from its base.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop hiding. Come out!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander suddenly spun around to face the darkness behind him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hana, hiding in the shadows, ready to ambush Alexander, jumped back, startled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander ignored her completely, conjuring his light sword with a flick of his wrist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he channeled the Force into his blade, an intense white light erupted, radiating heat so fierce it seemed to melt the air itself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The surrounding dark mist vanished instantly like snow evaporating under a scorching sun.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a swift motion, Alexander struck the pillar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was a faint sizzling sound, but the pillar appeared unmoved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A second later, half the pillar slid off and crashed to the ground with a heavy thud.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The smooth cut surface gleamed with a metallic sheen, revealing some kind of ultra-hard alloy that everyday cutting tools couldn't even scratch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it weren't for Alexander's Lightsabers, even industrial cutting equipment would have been useless against it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the pillar fell, the dark mist surrounding it disappeared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The entire Demon Summoning Array consisted of 108 pillars, all connected underground where the Red Umbrella Group's members were powering them with gemstone formations.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But with Alexander destroying the pillar, its gemstone lost its power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rock shouted in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's happening? How did it break? We've lost one of the array's anchor points... That's special alloy as hard as diamond nothing should be able to cut through it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix's face darkened as he growled through gritted teeth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It must be Alexander he's behind this! But it doesn't matter we've already established contact with the Great Being. He can't stop us now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As each cylindrical pillar was sliced apart, the eerie black mist that had blanketed the battlefield vanished without a trace, revealing the plaza in its entirety.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone had been helplessly wandering in circles under the mist's influence, yet Alexander had broken through it with surprising ease.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Trying to sneak up on me, huh?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Augusta whirled around, his eyes locking onto Hana, who was creeping up behind him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hana froze in shock, caught off guard by the sudden disappearance of the black mist that should have covered his approach.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Augusta's eyes gleamed with contempt and murderous intent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Originally, Hana had planned to ambush Alexander first, but when that plan fell through, he targeted Augusta instead. Talk about rotten luck getting spotted twice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hana felt like he'd just swallowed a bitter pill.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"RAAAH!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Augusta's massive frame suddenly tensed. He dropped low, tucked his head, and squared his shoulders like a locomotive before charging straight at Hana.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're doomed!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hana roared, drawing his blade in a lightning-fast cross-slash.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Augusta was faster, grabbing both of Hana's wrists in an iron grip. They were locked in a brutal test of strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veins bulged on their foreheads as both men pushed with everything they had.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The outcome would be decisive&mdash;either Augusta would snap Hana's wrists like twigs, or Hana would slice Augusta into quarters right where he stood.</span></p><div class="pagination">
