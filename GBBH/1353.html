  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the grand Darwin Court, a large table was surrounded by several individuals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeffrey presided at the head, with Douglas and Zain to his left, and Alexander and Logan to his right.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeffrey said, "Alexander, Zain, it's thanks to your efforts that we were able to locate Princess Isolde. His Majesty will surely reward you generously."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander humbly replied, "Mr. Dewey, you're too kind. We were merely fulfilling our duty."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Those wicked Risunese may appear benign, but they are truly demons. They deserve no mercy!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Absolutely! They all deserve to perish!" Logan shouted in agreement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Douglas lifted his glass and declared, "Let's raise a toast to these two heroes!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zain chuckled and casually glanced at Alexander. "Even though you're young, your martial skills are remarkable. Defeating Arturo, a level-four warrior, was no small feat!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander could only smile awkwardly; it was a secret he couldn't let slip. As a level-three warrior, he had taken down a level-four master like Arturo, and it certainly made no sense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zain sensed that Alexander harbored a significant secret, but being a chivalrous man himself, he decided to look past it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, Alexander was a member of the Dominion Church and likely a martial arts prodigy. Zain laughed and said, "What I admire most are young heroes. If you ever need anything, just let me know, and I'll be more than happy to help."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After the meal, a sudden, powerful shout resonated from outside the hall. "The orders have arrived!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone quickly abandoned their banquet. Jeffrey commanded that the main gate be opened to welcome the official delivering the decree. All the lights were lit, and the officials donned their formal attire, bowing in the hall. Alexander and Logan followed suit, bowing behind the others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Two guards entered with an air of authority, taking positions on either side.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A senior guard strode in, holding a piece of paper, and announced, "Alexander Hawthorne, a member of the Dominion Church, has vanquished evil and slain wickedness. His Majesty is greatly pleased and will reward him generously, conferring upon him the title of Earl with jurisdiction over a three-mile area."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone bowed in respect. Alexander stepped forward to receive the order, and congratulations poured in from all sides.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It turned out that the guard announcing the order hadn't found Alexander at the Dominion Church, so upon learning he was at Darwin Court, he headed straight there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was Alexander's first significant reward. Holding the order in his hands, he couldn't help but think that the king was rather stingy. All he wanted was some money and a few houses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeffrey remarked, "Alexander, at just 16 years old, you're already an Earl. Don't disappoint His Majesty!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander wondered, "Is being an Earl really that impressive?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Douglas, noticing Alexander's uncertain expression, smiled and said, "While the title of Earl may not be very high, His Majesty has granted you governance over three miles, which is quite remarkable. Within that area, you'll be the one in charge!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, I'm the leader of a three-mile radius?" Alexander pondered, feeling a surge of excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Logan clapped Alexander on the shoulder, saying, "Congratulations, Alexander! You're now an official."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander squinted at Logan and joked, "Don't worry! I won't be selling sweet potatoes. If I ever do, you can bet I'll take you along!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Selling sweet potatoes? Everyone looked puzzled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander clarified, "What I mean is, I intend to serve the people wholeheartedly. If I fail, I might as well go home and sell sweet potatoes."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Very well said!" Jeffrey stroked his long beard, narrowing his eyes in agreement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the Dominion Church, Alexander was immersed in studying energy techniques in his bedroom. Logan had already returned to Emerald Manor, having copied the energy techniques alongside him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This technique could infinitely unlock one's potential, refine oneself, and achieve inner connection.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His muscles and bones felt as strong as fine steel, allowing him to sense the aura of battle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What was that aura? Alexander found himself puzzled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He sat cross-legged, practicing Muscle-Tendon Classic, gradually entering a state of complete focus. The golden energy in his left chest emitted a gentle warmth, spreading throughout his body, while the spiritual energy flowed steadily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander's mind was clear. He felt his body growing stronger, his muscles and bones becoming more resilient, and he couldn't help but feel elated.</span></p><div class="pagination">
