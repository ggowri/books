  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"1.1 million dollars! 1.5 million dollars! Two million dollars!" Chase glared at Rosalia, knowing that no matter how much he increased the price, he could not win Rosalia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In fact, two million dollars a month was the limit for Chase. In his view, women were not so valuable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I have been sincere enough. Do you think two million dollars are not enough? Don't be so arrogant!" Chase clenched his fists and walked towards Rosalia in a rage, completely ignoring Alexander and Ariella.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chase thought it must be Rosalia's credit that Ariella could escape the kidnapping and catch Gore. As for Alexander and Ariella, Chase didn't take them seriously at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just two million dollars. You are really stingy. You want my girl. Then why don't you ask her owner?" Alexander stepped forward with a smile and stood in front of Chase.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What? You are her owner?" Chase stared at Alexander in shock and jealousy. "You are such a loser. How could you own such a beauty? You are bragging." Chase's tone was full of contempt and chill.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander didn't say anything. He pulled Rosalia in his arms, put his hands on her bubble butt, and then kissed her rosy lips. It&nbsp;was&nbsp;not until Rosalia clung to Alexander breathlessly that Alexander stopped the deep kiss and let her go with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You... You..." Chase was trembling with anger, thinking Alexander was provoking him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chase took a deep breath and sneered, "How dare you! I'll kill you and throw you into the sea to feed the sharks."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Be careful, Alexander!" Ariella was a little nervous. After all, Chase was fierce.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander rolled his eyes at Chase contemptuously, "Humph, loser!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chase was furious. He laughed, "Brat, I'll definitely kill you today, or I will give up the position of the head of the Obsidian Gang."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, just do it." Alexander looked calm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chase waved his hand and shouted, "Wayne, this bastard is so bold. Kill him, and I guarantee that Gore's position will be yours."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, Chase." Wayne, a bruiser in a tight black vest with tattoos all over his shoulders, walked towards Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wayne crossed his fingers and clenched them, making some crisping sound. He said to Alexander, "You dared to provoke Chase. I'll send you to hell. You asked for it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wayne roared. His burly body expanded, and his muscles bulged, which burst his tight vest. His brawny arms became thicker than the average person's thigh, and his thighs were like pillars. The fierce presence he exuded was daunting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wayne was the first expert among Chase's subordinates, and he used to be the champion of the underground boxing circle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you for killing Gore, or I wouldn't get his position." Wayne pinched his knuckles and twisted his neck, making them crackle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wayne had been the champion of the underground boxing circle. When his enemies surrounded him, he got a shot and happened to meet Chase. Chase saved him, so Wayne was very loyal to Chase.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Chase usurped the position of the head of the Obsidian Gang, Wayne killed many members loyal to Ariella and helped Chase a lot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wayne had been suppressed because he was not in harmony with Gore, and he became the third in command. Now that Gore was dead, the opportunity to turn over had finally come.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Be a man. Don't rely on your woman!" Wayne looked at Alexander and Rosalia. Obviously, he was a little afraid of Rosalia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smiled, "Relax. She won't interfere in this fight."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Wayne saw Rosalia stepping back, he was overjoyed. He thought, "Without this woman's help, this bastard is no match for me at all!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
