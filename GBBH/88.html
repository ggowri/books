  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Sebastian stared at the grim notice of his impending doom, feeling as though lightning had struck him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What? I have only forty-eight hours left to live?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The weight of the news threatened to shatter him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He couldn't help but reflect on his earlier days in Loscity, filled with ambition and confidence. Now, here he was, facing a fate worse than death.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The thought of his son's ruined hands seemed trivial compared to his own mortality.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In a moment of sheer desperation, he cast aside his pride and dialed his cousin Guzman for help.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It didn't take long for Guzman to pick up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His voice, cold and indifferent, carried a hint of satisfaction. "Sebastian, did you wrap things up with Alexander already? Is he dead yet?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Sebastian felt a wave of despair wash over him as he recounted his harrowing situation, his voice cracking with emotion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">On the other end, there was a heavy silence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After what felt like an eternity, Guzman's voice broke through, sharp and commanding. "You're all useless! I'll have the black-robed sorcerers from the City of Sorcery handle this. Just buy yourself some time for a few days, and that's it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With that, Guzman hung up, leaving Sebastian both relieved and anxious.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The City of Sorcery, located in the mystical Catemacola of Mesco, was known as a haven for sorcerers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was a place so enigmatic that even the president of Mesco had sought refuge there.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Fine, I'll play along for now. I'll give him a few fake addresses to buy some time. By the time the sorcerer arrives in Loscity, I'll make sure Alexander pays for what he's done!" Sebastian thought, a wicked grin creeping onto his face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Quick, get the car ready! I need to see Alexander!" Sebastian shouted, his urgency palpable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Dylan tried to reason with him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mr. Sebastian Tate, your health isn't in good shape. You shouldn't be running around; it could worsen your condition."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Get lost! What do you know? You're all a bunch of quacks!" Sebastian snapped, shoving Dylan aside.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Someone! Take me to Alexander right now!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His teeth were clenched, and his expression was one of pure fury.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He knew he had to save himself first, and once the black-robed sorcerer arrived, he would take care of Alexander.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Sebastian had to swallow his pride and seek Alexander's mercy to survive.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Before long, they arrived at Alexander's lavish mansion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As Charlize heard the roar of engines outside, she immediately went on high alert. Several black luxury cars had pulled up, and she grabbed a shotgun before opening the door.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Sebastian was being carried out of the car by a couple of burly men, his face contorted in pain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Get Alexander out here! Mr. Sebastian Tate wants to see him!" one of the men barked, puffing out his chest.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Charlize smirked, using the butt of her shotgun to knock him off balance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Just a mutt barking orders. Who do you think you are? This is private property, so scram!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The man was about to retaliate when Sebastian, fueled by desperation, pulled out his gun and fired a shot at the reckless goon.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The silenced pistol made a dull sound, and the man crumpled to the ground, bleeding profusely, before being unceremoniously dragged away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Sebastian turned to Charlize, forcing a smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Ms. Collins, there's been a misunderstanding. I'm here to ask for Mr. Hawthorne's forgiveness. Could you please let him know I'd like to speak with him?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Charlize stood frozen, taken aback by the sudden humility of the president of the Brilliant Group.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"My boss isn't here, and you're not welcome. Now get lost!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Charlize aimed her gun at him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You..." Sebastian's anger flared, and his headache intensified.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Charlize had already chambered a round, her demeanor threatening.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Sebastian, realizing he had to maintain his composure to plead for Alexander's mercy, swallowed hard.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Let's go, to the Saint Group..." Sebastian muttered, his voice laced with frustration as he led his entourage away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As they left, Charlize couldn't help but think, "Wow, my boss is something else. I never expected Sebastian to beg for mercy so quickly."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At the Saint Group, Ava was deeply troubled. Though Sebastian had been thwarted by Alexander once, she knew he wouldn't rest until he had his revenge.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Rebecca, you're part of one of the four major families in Loscity. Is there any way you can ally with us at the Saint Group to deal with Sebastian together?" Ava implored.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Rebecca shook her head slowly, then let out a resigned sigh. "Ava, even though I'm the nominal heir, I don't have real power in the family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Sebastian's primary target is Alexander. My advice is to let this go. Trying to tackle him alone could end up being more trouble than it's worth. You'd be better off avoiding Alexander to prevent further problems."</p><div class="pagination">
