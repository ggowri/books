  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shadow, who'd have thought Alexander would turn Treasure Island around like this? Used to be chaotic as hell, but now it's practically a safe haven.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Augustine's end wasn't a fluke. We may deal in the underworld, but we don't need to be enemies of the people. In fact, we should keep the peace. Guzman never saw that and ended up a target for everyone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, Alexander's got the Brilliant Group running like a well-oiled machine!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The silver-haired old man nodded with a satisfied smile, clearly impressed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shadow stayed quiet for a moment, then asked, "Godfather, Mr. Anthony Hawthorne openly defied your orders and went after Miss Ashley. How do you want me to handle it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The old man's gaze shifted, snapping from weary to piercing in a heartbeat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His frail frame seemed to swell with strength, turning him from a withered old man into a beast ready to strike.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Shadow, seasoned as he was, felt his heart race.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Guess I'm getting old... not only is that snake SATAN coming for me, but my own son's stepping out of line," the old man sighed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sure, Anthony let Ashley go, but that doesn't mean he shouldn't pay a price. I heard the Red Umbrella Group's top research project is being handled by some old-timer...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If he's that old, he's just taking up space. And that research division of his has done nothing but stir up trouble. Let's have them both disappear. Consider it a little wake-up call for Anthony."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shadow dropped to one knee.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Understood, sir!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>.....</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the nightmare, Alexander was running for his life, clutching Ava as he stumbled through the darkness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thick fog surrounded them, drenching the air in an eerie, bone-chilling silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It felt like an endless maze of twisted forest, every path leading nowhere.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The monster thundered after them, plowing through even the thickest trees.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander, breath ragged, tightened his grip on Ava and pushed forward with all he </span><span>had.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Huff... huff..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They gasped for air, barely keeping ahead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He clutched his broken lightsaber, not daring to glance back. He knew it meant certain death if he did.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thud, thud, thud!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their frantic footsteps pounded through the forest, mingling with their panicked breaths.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Graaah</span><span>!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The monster's roar echoed from behind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thud!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava tripped, and Alexander barely caught her before she tumbled into a ravine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's right behind us!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava's scream sliced through the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Boom! Boom!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The ground trembled as a towering shadow emerged&mdash;hulking, with bristling black spines, and a twisted, hideous face topped with devilish horns.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each step of its thick, muscular legs sent shockwaves through the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shockingly, a small figure stood perched on the monster's shoulder, her skirt whipping wildly in the wind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Alexander recognized her, he froze, his whole body locking up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ashley! What are you doing here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ashley stood on the monster's shoulder, her gaze icy, her eyes flashing with an unrecognizable fury as though she didn't know him at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What... is this!?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Panic twisted Alexander's voice, his heartbeat hammering in his chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing his daughter like that made his legs feel like they were made of lead. He couldn't take another step.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Boom!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The monster took another massive step, sending the ground into violent tremors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alex, we have to run! We'll be crushed if we don't move now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava tugged him desperately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The colossal monster lunged at them, lifting one massive foot to stomp down with earth-shaking force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Its huge, dark foot loomed over them like a small mountain, hurtling down with a deadly whistle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ashley, it's me&mdash;your dad!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander shouted with everything he had, but the monster didn't hesitate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Help!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava's terrified eyes filled with tears, her face twisting in fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The enormous foot was right above them, about to crush them both.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ashley, no!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander bellowed as he woke with a start.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He sprang to his feet and raced to his daughter's room next door.</span></p><div class="pagination">
