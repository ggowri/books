  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava shot her a glance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Godfather's already claimed me. Does it matter whether I like it or not?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma caught the vivid excitement dancing in her eyes and grew anxious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Look, Ms. Blackburn, Alexander's got some tricks up his sleeve, sure. But he's not good enough for you. You should ask the Godfather to reconsider - pick a business tycoon or a political elite instead. A power couple would be much better."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava sipped her wine and shook her head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I see it differently. Alexander possesses mysterious powers but isn't arrogant; this is humility. He endures humiliation in the Fairfax family for love; this is sacrifice. He volunteers at the nursing home year-round; this is kindness and compassion."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Good luck finding another man like that these days!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma rolled her eyes. She knew Ava had totally fallen for this Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She snorted in disagreement. "Jane and Ryan walked all over him, and he didn't even do a thing. What a coward!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava laughed. "Really? You think so?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just watch. He'll definitely make those two jerks pay. Trust me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma shook her head hard. "Well, I </span><span>can</span><span>'</span><span>t get it at all!</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anticipation gleamed in Ava's eyes. "He's not someone people can push around. With his abilities, he'll make something of himself sooner or later."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma gestured at the VIPs around them with a sneer. "Make something of himself? Even if he worked his butt off for ten lifetimes, he still wouldn't match any of these people."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava's expression turned cold. "Emma, we do get along well, but stay out of my personal life. You should really learn to hold your tongue."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Blackburn, I'm just trying to help..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma trailed off, scared but still doubtful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava thought for a moment, then smirked. "I really despise that scumbag Ryan and Jane. Check if the Hawkins Group is actually one of our corporate partners."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without hesitation, Emma made some calls to check it out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a while, she replied, "Yes, Ms. Blackburn. The Hawkins family is indeed a long-term partner of us. They're invited to the ball too."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava said coolly, "Cancel all cooperation with the Hawkins family. And revoke Ryan's invitation."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma sighed internally. It was obvious that Ava's doing this all for Alexander. It meant she had really fallen hard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She could only nod and say, "Right away, Ms. Blackburn!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After making the call, her expression turned weird.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Blackburn, it can't be canceled... Alice said that Ryan is a key focus of the new chairman, so we can't cancel the partnership. The chairman specifically requested that they be invited to the ball."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What!?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava slammed her wine glass down, red liquid splashing across the table like dark blood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her face turned serious. Godfather hadn't revealed who the new chairman was. It remained a mystery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ryan's got connections with the new chairman?" Ava frowned. "If Alexander really wants to go up against him, he's screwed."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Blackburn," Emma cut in, "don't risk your standing with the chairman over someone like Alexander. I knew he wasn't a good guy. It's not worth it to offend the chairman for him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who knows if the new chairman is Mr. Augustine Hawthorne, or maybe even Mr. Anthony Hawthorne?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava's beautiful eyes flashed with a sharp glint, and then she murmured to herself, "If Alexander refuses to back down, what should I do..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Alexander lounged in his chair, legs crossed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alice stood before him respectfully, her voluptuous curves showcased </span><span>perfectly </span><span>in a tight off-shoulder dress.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander chuckled, "So Ava wants to help me handle Ryan?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alice nodded, her expression complex.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne, should we tell Ms. Blackburn you're the new chairman?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead of answering, Alexander rose and walked to the window, taking in the glittering cityscape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His tall frame radiated such mysterious power that even Alice, used to dealing with big shots, felt intimidated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Why do I feel his presence... overshadows even Godfather now?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">T</span><span style="font-style: italic;">he ruthless and cold Mr. Augustine Hawthorne and Mr. Anthony Hawthorne can't compete with that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Am I losing it?</span><span> She thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She shook her head to regain her senses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Alexander was oblivious. After becoming a Warrior, he had undergone an earth-shaking transformation without even realizing it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Keep my identity quiet for now. And watch Augustine and Anthony's movements."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Have you found out who was behind the last assassination attempt?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though calm and flat, his icy tone sent chills down Alice's spine.</span></p><div class="pagination">
