  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was a first for Jonah. No one had gotten the upper hand on him since he'd become a metahuman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead of being frustrated, he was pumped. He'd been itching for a challenge that could help him level up, and it looked like he'd finally found it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander had to admit he was a bit impressed. Jonah's power was no joke. He was almost as strong as Felix had been back in the day.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, Alexander, you've proved you're worth my time," Jonah called out. "Let's quit playing around and show what we've really got!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a battle cry that echoed through the air, Jonah charged forward at full speed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He swung his massive sword, sending a blinding arc of light straight at Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jonah knew that strike could slice clean through solid steel. He was betting everything on this attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander didn't even flinch. Instead of reaching for his Lightsabers, he met Jonah's sword with his bare hands. The clash rang out like steel on steel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His palms were wrapped in the Force, making them as tough as armor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jonah was going all out, throwing every ounce of power he had into his attacks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His sword became a blur of motion, creating a deadly web of light that threatened to slice Alexander to ribbons.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He moved like a ghost, his form flickering around Alexander in a deadly dance of steel and shadow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The air itself seemed to fill with sword strikes as Jonah unleashed his barrage, keeping Alexander trapped in the center of his assault.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone watching could barely follow what was happening.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They just saw Jonah's non-stop attacks and figured he must have the upper hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quentin, Ilona, and the others had backed up around the corner of the hallway. They weren't taking any chances getting close to this fight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The only thing they could see was the constant flash of Jonah's </span><span>sword</span><span>, growing brighter and more intense with each strike. His power seemed to be building by the second.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander had completely vanished from view behind the wall of flashing steel that filled the hallway. Nobody could tell if he was even still standing. All they could see was the deadly light show of Jonah's sword.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anxiety flashed across Quentin's face. He wanted nothing more than to rush in and stop this, but he knew better. With that </span><span>sword</span><span> </span><span>flashing around, charging in would be </span><span>suicide.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Ilona didn't dare to make a move, afraid of getting caught in the crossfire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But as a level-four metahuman, her enhanced vision picked up what Quentin had missed. Alexander wasn't hurt at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There wasn't a drop of blood on the ground, and Jonah's dead-serious expression told her everything she needed to know.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jonah was kicking himself now. He'd picked Alexander as a stepping stone to test his own limits, but man, had he read this wrong.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Alexander really lost his cool, Jonah knew he might not walk away from this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Here he was, going all out with his sword, throwing everything he had into each strike. But Alexander just stood there, calm as could be, blocking every single attack with one bare hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every time the sword met Alexander's </span><span>palm,</span><span> Jonah felt like he'd stuck his finger in an electrical socket.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What really got under his skin was Alexander's expression&mdash;totally relaxed, like this was just a game to him. It was driving Jonah crazy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Look, Jonah, you picked the wrong guy to mess with today," Alexander said with a hint of boredom. "I'm done wasting time here. Don't say I didn't warn you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Jonah could process what was happening, Alexander's hand shot out in a quick strike.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Force slammed into the </span><span>sword</span><span>, nearly ripping it from Jonah's grip. His hands went numb, tingling like they'd fallen asleep.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's power kept rising, </span><span>and </span><span>his energy so sharp it made everyone's skin crawl. The air itself seemed to crackle with tension.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Cut the talk and take this!" Jonah raised his broadsword with both hands, refusing to back down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brilliant meta-energy rippled along the </span><span>sword</span><span> </span><span>as he swung it down at Alexander's head with everything he had.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was his all-or-nothing shot&mdash;he'd burned all his bridges and had nowhere left to retreat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The desperation pushed Jonah to his absolute limits, and he could feel himself teetering on the edge of breaking through to level-five metahuman status.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This do-or-die strike had actually brought him closer than ever to that next level&mdash;he could practically taste the surge of power waiting just beyond his reach.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The realization made Jonah's eyes light up, and he poured even more speed into his attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You poor fool," Alexander shouted, finally drawing his Lightsaber.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The </span><span>sword</span><span> </span><span>that emerged wasn't particularly flashy, but it cut through the darkness like a beam of truth&mdash;and through Jonah's broadsword like it was made of paper.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Force exploded from the strike with apocalyptic power, arcing straight for Jonah's throat.</span></p><div class="pagination">
