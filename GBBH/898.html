He must be captured alive!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Catch him and make him kneel!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The orc generals fell one by one, but the remaining ones were not afraid at all and rushed forward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, Marcus was accidentally hugged by a senior orc general behind him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instantly, the orc generals rushed forward. They had massive bodies, and compared with them, Marcus was like a child.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But a group of orc generals could not suppress him. After Marcus twisted off the heads of three of the orc generals, he finally ran out of strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Many orc generals rushed forward, and they were tightly entangled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus twisted off the head of an orc general again, but at the same time, a sharp machete was inserted into his body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Son, remember this! There are only Warriors who die standing, no warriors who live kneeling!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus roared at Edgar, then grabbed two senior orc generals and rolled down from the fortress wall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a daze, Edgar heard the screams of the orc generals and the groans of his father.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dad..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Two tears of blood flowed from Edgar's eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He reached out and groped on the ground, trying to pick up his Lightsabers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Lightsabers was not his, but was left by Jabir. Jabir had just had a child, but orcs killed his wife and child.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Three days ago, he died together with a squad of orcs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although he reached the Lightsabers, Edgar didn't have a trace of the Force in his body to activate it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He gritted his teeth and tried desperately to activate the Lightsabers, but his chest felt extremely painful, and he went into shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were only a few Warriors left in the fortress, and they kept falling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The orcs suffered heavy losses, but they were still boundless, engulfing the entire fortress...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It had been quite a long time before the unconscious Edgar was kicked awake.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This guy is still alive!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>An orc found the dying Edgar and kicked him hard again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Edgar then vomited mouthfuls of blood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop playing. Just chop off his head. The captain has captured a beautiful woman with a great body, like a doll. If we go over quickly, maybe she is still alive and we can still have some fun."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Really? You didn't lie to me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The orc's eyes widened in surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I heard her name is Freya. Everyone is lining up. I don't think she will last long. Let's go over there quickly. Maybe we can still play with her once. If we go too late, she will be played to death."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A Warrior's woman is the most delicate flower. I must enjoy her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two orcs were so excited that their saliva was flying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Freya... They caught Freya..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Edgar suddenly raised his head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What a terrifying pair of eyes they were. His entire eyeball was blood red and the pupils could no longer be seen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He turned his head suddenly and looked in a specific direction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although they were thousands of feet apart and there was a wall blocking the way, his gaze penetrated everything, and he saw everything clearly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that familiar room, several orcs were surrounding a naked woman and caressing her... They were laughing obscenely...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was a long line of orcs waiting outside, each of them drooling at the sight of the woman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Freya didn't move at all, with no expression on her pretty face. She just let them bully her, with blood flowing from the corners of her mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, she seemed to sense something, turned her head, and looked in the direction of the fortress wall with a hint of a desperate smile on her face...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry. I'll stomp this guy to death, and then we'll get in line."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The orc raised his foot and stomped hard on Edgar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The orc was shocked. No matter how hard he tried, he couldn't step on it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A terrifying burning force burst out from Edgar's red eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two orcs screamed and were instantly burned into firemen, burning fiercely like two giant torches.</span></p><div class="pagination">
