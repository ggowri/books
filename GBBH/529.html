  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brittany reminded, "It must be Harry who called someone over."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander said disapprovingly, "Let's pay the bill."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He held Brittany and walked towards Harry in a grand manner.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harry said, "Damn it. Stop!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He swung the iron rod fiercely and was about to hit Alexander hard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He suddenly felt a sharp pain in his abdomen, and then was kicked by Alexander and flew backwards.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harry was like an outgoing cannonball, hitting a whole bunch of people and then crashing to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander did not stop and moved among the crowd like a ghost.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one could keep up with his speed. Every time Alexander appeared, a big man would fall down, wailing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brittany took the opportunity to smash everything in the surroundings with her </span><span>helmet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a short while, more than half of the dozens of people Harry called over were lying on the ground, wailing and rolling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The rest of the people were also frightened, leaving the two far away to watch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Useless! Is this the strength of your family?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander stepped on Harry's chest with a cold expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harry vomited blood and glared at Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Boy, don't be so proud. Tell me your name. Sooner or later, I will... Ah!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before he could finish his words, Harry screamed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander stepped on his sternum and ribs and collapsed them. A lot of blood was coming out of Harry's mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Facing the members of the Morris family who were in alliance with Felix, Alexander showed no mercy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harry was badly injured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smiled and said to Brittany, "Have you ever experienced the feeling of flying on land?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What? No..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brittany was confused.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smiled mysteriously, then picked up Brittany in public.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brittany blushed and had no intention of asking any questions. Instead, she put her arms around Alexander's neck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, Alexander, holding Brittany, disappeared at the door like lightning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone turned around to look, but Alexander had already disappeared into the night.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brittany felt the strong wind blowing towards her. Her eyes were difficult to open. It was obvious that Alexander's speed was extremely fast.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In just a few seconds, Alexander arrived at the underground parking lot opposite, put Brittany on the motorcycle, and touched her buttocks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brittany hugged Alexander coquettishly, unwilling to let go.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander couldn't help but press Brittany on the seat and lift up her legs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She said, "Don't... Someone will see us here..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brittany was so embarrassed that she quickly grabbed Alexander's arm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander looked around. The area was full of parked cars, and the location of the motorcycle happened to be an inconspicuous corner.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He chuckled. "Don't shout. Others won't know. Don't worry. I can control the time freely and won't make you too tired."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brittany exclaimed. Alexander's hands were already covering her breasts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The electric shock-like pleasure immediately spread throughout her body, and she no longer had the strength to resist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She said, "Alexander, didn't Felix go to the Kaylon entertainment center? I'll... I'll take you to find the leader of the Kaylon..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brittany was panting, entangled with Alexander like an octopus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, moans were heard from the corner of the parking lot, which were gentle and alluring.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kingsdon</span><span> was brightly lit and full of fun.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This bustling international city, with its bright lights and nightlife, was addictive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The bar was unremarkable and located in a remote alley.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Normally speaking, no one would patronize such a low-class bar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But what was strange was that there was a long queue outside the bar, and the majority of the customers were male.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From a distance, Alexander heard the men in the team whispering.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't know if Nancy will come today. I want to see her. Even if I have to go without food and water for a few days, I'm willing to meet her!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's hard to say. Whether Nancy comes or not depends entirely on her mood. If she's in a good mood, she'll even buy everyone a drink."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Last time, there was a lucky guy who got the drink that Nancy mixed herself. I was so envious of him."</span></p><div class="pagination">
