  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This young man is probably an amateur. I don't believe he can succeed."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, if it was so easy to find high-grade gems, we would have made a fortune long ago."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's right. He is doomed to lose."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing everyone's discussion, Olivia showed anxiety in her beautiful eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, you must win."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, Alexander selected a piece of ore. Through his All-seeing Eyes, he could see a strong light in the center of the ore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There must be a high-grade gem in it, even a top-grade gem.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander waved to the staff next to him and said, "I'll choose this one."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The staff member took a look at the sign on the stone and said in confusion, "The material of this ore is not good, and the chance of it containing a gemstone is extremely small, so its price is only five thousand dollars."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Olivia quickly persuaded, "Alexander, you'd better not choose this cheap ore. Generally, the chances of cutting out gemstones from expensive ores are higher. How about we choose an expensive one?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shut up!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan shouted viciously, "This is a bet between him and me. Don't interfere. Everyone saw that he chose this one, and he can't change. I am waiting for him to give me fifty million dollars."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't help laughing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You idiot. You chose a worthless piece of scrap ore. Do you want to cut out a high-grade gem from this ore? Impossible."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan laughed triumphantly. He was confident that he would win.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Olivia was so anxious that she was about to cry, but she didn't know how to help Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander glanced at Evan coldly and smiled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry, I won't change my mind. I'll choose this one. The price doesn't mean anything. The stone you just bought cost thirty million dollars, but what did you get in the end?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan was so angry that he trembled all over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I will buy it. Cut it open." Alexander waved to the staff member.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan sneered, "You treat a piece of scrap ore as a treasure. You are a bumpkin."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shut up! If you keep talking, I will beat you up."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was annoyed, and he stared at Evan with cold eyes, which made Evan feel deep fear in his heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan gritted his teeth and dared not speak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The staff member started cutting the stone with a cutting machine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The onlookers all shook their heads, not interested in this ore at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Haha, there are no gems in this kind of ore. Was this ore picked up from the roadside?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's possible. Sometimes, the organizers would pick up some stones and use them as ores."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This boy is doomed to lose. There's no way he can win."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The person who was cutting stones also looked sad.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had cut open many ores, so he could tell at a glance that this one did not contain any gems.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander suddenly stopped him and then drew a line on the ore with a pen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said, "Cut in this direction and stop after this. Then use a grinder. Start from this side and grind all around."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The staff member rolled his eyes speechlessly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Didn't Alexander make things difficult for him?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What do you mean? You know there is a gem inside, so you don't use a cutter to avoid damaging the gem?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone burst into laughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Haha, he is acting. I think he wants to delay time and try not to lose so quickly."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan kept mocking Alexander, "It's just a piece of scrap. Just cut it open. If there is a gem inside, I'll eat the stone."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander pointed at the line firmly. "Listen to me, start using the grinder after cutting here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The staff member was helpless. He thought there was no need to use a grinder, but since Alexander asked for it, he had to follow his request.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the grinder was turned on, the sound of violent friction was very harsh.</span></p><div class="pagination">
