  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Olivia gazed deeply into Alexander's </span><span>eyes,</span><span> her voice unwavering.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm here to repay a debt, and I truly care for you. As long as you don't find me repulsive, my body belongs solely to you. I want to be your woman!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her resolve was ironclad, unshakable by any force or circumstance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, she swallowed the dick once more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's hand roamed over her voluptuous figure, sliding down the crevice of her buttocks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Olivia's body sprang upward. She clutched Alexander's head fiercely to her chest, her legs tightening around him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander inhaled deeply, folding Olivia's legs to her chest and pressing himself upon her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>An hour later, the frenzy had subsided.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Olivia, now coy, nestled her flushed face against Alexander's chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, I will obey you in everything from now on."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's hand gently pressed upon the tender secret garden below Olivia's abdomen, using the Force to heal, his warm palm soothing the slightly swelling pussy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Olivia's eyes gradually closed, a sweet smile on her face as she drifted into sleep.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon returning home, Alexander found the master bedroom still lit, a familiar silhouette standing by the window, anxiously looking out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Ava!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's face lit up with joy as he quickened his pace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tonight, he was immersed in a flurry of activities. Beyond offering solace to Ava in their intimate moments, his impatience was piqued as he eagerly awaited to fuse the newly acquired top-grade gem into his Lightsaber.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next morning, Alexander drove to the hotel to pick up Olivia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Olivia trotted happily towards Alexander in high heels.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dressed in a black pencil skirt that accentuated her voluptuous form, with long flowing hair and delicate features, she exuded youthful charm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's have breakfast first," Alexander said, pulling Olivia towards the hotel restaurant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Olivia clung tightly to Alexander's arm, her short skirt revealing a pair of long, slender legs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander coughed, collecting himself, and refrained from lingering too long.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Last night, he had barely slept, not only consoling Ava and Rosalia but also melting the gem into his Lightsaber core.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Four of the seven gems were now united, with only the orange, green, and purple left to gather.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The hotel restaurant offered a diverse array of breakfast options.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From bread and butter to fried eggs and sausages, everything was available.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was peak breakfast time, with guests bustling about.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They found an empty table, and Alexander ordered two servings of spaghetti, two desserts, and two glasses of milk.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Olivia's eyes never left Alexander, filled with admiration and affection.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's wrong? Did I not wash my face properly this morning?" Alexander chuckled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, I just think you're really handsome, truly!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Really? Can you stare at me and feel full?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Pfft!" Olivia laughed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They chattered intimately while eating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, a man in his forties, well-groomed with slicked-back hair, dressed in a neatly pressed suit and polished shoes, approached.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Olivia, I've been looking for you for days. I didn't expect to find you here; you really had me worried sick," he said in a raspy voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that voice, Olivia's expression hardened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't need to turn around to know who this annoying man was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She told Alexander. "This guy, Cedric Blackwood, is one of my father's subordinates. When the Mafia came, he was the first to abandon my father and flee!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Olivia ignored him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cedric leaned in, giving Alexander a cold once-over before smiling at Olivia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've been searching for you all this time, fearing the Mafia might find you. How could I face your father otherwise?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you planning to go to the exchange? It's full of Mafia members; you mustn't go!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cedric's feigned concern was evident, his eyes ogling Olivia's ample chest and thighs, brimming with desire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander saw through Cedric's intentions; his lascivious gaze revealed his sinister motives.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Olivia slammed her hand on the table, berating him, "Cedric, what are you pretending for? When my father was surrounded, you were the first to run. Even if you had escaped, you could have at least reported it, but no, you hid away!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
