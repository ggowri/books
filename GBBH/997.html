  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm sorry. I'll hand over the cemetery to you, Mr. Hawthorne. Please, let the Vance family go," Axel pleaded, his once proud demeanor now shattered. He hung his head, defeated, speaking to Alexander with a mix of helplessness and despair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Asher's fists clenched at his sides, his rage bubbling over. But before he could explode, Axel shouted, "Kneel! Kneel and apologize! Are you deaf?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Asher's body quivered, his face contorting into a vicious snarl.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kneel! If you don't, you're no longer my grandson!" Axel roared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To salvage the legacy of the Vance family, he found himself compelled to seek out Alexander, begging for a sliver of opportunity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Asher's face flushed from blue to red. With a heavy plop, he dropped to his knees, but inside, his anger raged like wildfire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "Damn you, Alexander!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His teeth ground together, and his expression was darker than a storm cloud.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smirked coldly. It was clear Asher still hadn't learned his lesson.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that very moment, Ryder, who had been quivering like a leaf in the wind nearby, couldn't bear it any longer. He spun on his heel to escape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even the mighty Vance family had thrown in the towel, and Ryder knew all too well that he was next in line to face the repercussions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Trying to run? Not a chance," Alexander sneered. With a casual flick of his foot, a small stone launched forward like a bullet, piercing Ryder's left thigh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The rock hit the ground, bounced, and stabbed into the other leg.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ryder screamed and fell to the ground, blood pouring from two gaping wounds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But for Alexander, this was just the beginning. He winked at Augusta.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ryder had ridden on the Vance family's coattails for too long, thinking he was untouchable. Not only had he tried to desecrate the cemetery, but he'd also pushed Lily to the ground. Alexander wasn't going to let him off easy. It was a calculated </span><span>spectacle designed to etch fear into the hearts of onlookers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Augusta marched over, grabbed Ryder by the neck, and dragged him like a sack of potatoes to the nearest tombstone. With a rough heave, he threw Ryder to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ouch! Please, I'm begging you. Spare me..." Ryder pleaded in desperation. "Please, show some kindness. I was wrong, terribly wrong..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "Were they actually going to kill me right here, out in the open? It's downright barbaric!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A sea of faces turned ashen; their expressions contorted into masks of horror and disgust.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Oliver's eyes stretched wide, his throat bobbing with a hard swallow. As the chief of police in </span><span>Loscity</span><span>, he knew he should take command of the situation. Yet, an unspoken dread anchored him to the spot, his courage faltering at the brink of action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If the chief didn't act, neither would his men. They all pretended they didn't see a thing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne, I beg you! I was blind! Please, spare my life!" Ryder cried, dragging his broken body across the ground until he reached Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander looked down at him with eyes as cold as ice. Nothing but disgust filled his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry, your crimes aren't worthy of death yet. I won't kill you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At his words, Ryder exhaled in relief. But Alexander wasn't finished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander shifted the conversation with a somber tone. "But remember, you'll be spending your entire life atoning for your sins," he said. "From this moment forward, you're bound to this disability forever."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a simple wave of his hand, an invisible Force surged into Ryder's body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah!" Ryder's scream echoed as the wound in his leg expanded, nearly splitting his entire thigh open. He fainted on the spot, blood pooling beneath him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Axel and Asher knew that Alexander was using Ryder as a pawn in his cruel game, a stark warning aimed squarely at them. Alexander's ruthlessness was no mere rumor. They shivered uncontrollably, the cold reality setting in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Behind Alexander, Lily tugged gently at his sleeve.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her emotions had been a rollercoaster throughout the ordeal. Seeing the brutal punishment, part of her felt vindicated, but the other part couldn't bear the sight of such cruelty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander," she whispered with caution, "since they've apologized and are willing to hand over the cemetery, can't you let them go this once?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander turned slightly, giving her a reassuring pat on the hand. But when he faced the Vance family again, his eyes were as cold as winter frost.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"First," he declared, "you'll hand over the cemetery. Second, you'll cough up 100 million dollars in compensation. And third, you'll kneel right here until the sun rises tomorrow. Agree to these three conditions, and I might just consider letting your company off the hook."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Asher's face twisted with fury, his muscles tensing as he prepared to leap at Alexander. But Axel held him down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, I agree," Axel replied, gritting his teeth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A deathly silence enveloped the air. Gavin and the others stood as if carved from stone, and their faces were a gallery of shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even in the absence of their compliance, Alexander had the means to dismantle the Vance family single-handedly. Yet, he decided to bind them to him with half the profits from the magic powder.</span></p><div class="pagination">
