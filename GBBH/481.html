  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, I'm sorry. My mom didn't mean to get upset; she was tricked too."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava's big eyes filled with anxiety.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander chuckled softly, playfully pushing her onto the couch. He leaned in closer, kissing her and enjoying the moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava was moaning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava was dressed casually and didn't wear a bra. Her nipples were slightly protruding and visible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why don't you take off your top?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander teased with a grin and kneaded her breasts with his hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava's cheeks flushed deeper, but she didn't protest. She sat up, unbuttoning her top, revealing more of herself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her fair and soft breast was exposed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's gaze lingered, making her shyly hold onto his neck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What are you staring at?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, how could I not? You look great."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He effortlessly lifted her and headed to the bedroom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once there, Ava lay back on the bed, playfully lifting her legs, wearing only a pair of delicate panties.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Alexander leaned in, his warm breath sent shivers down her spine, and she felt excitement coursing through her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as she anticipated his next move, he suddenly paused, pulling out a large envelope and spilling its contents onto the bed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What... what is this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava was bewildered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When she recognized the face in the photos as her mother's, her cheeks burned with embarrassment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, Alexander opened a video on his phone, revealing Victor confessing to his wrongdoings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That scoundrel! He's inhuman!" Ava exclaimed, her blood boiling with anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry, I've already made sure he's been expelled from </span><span>Tijuanea</span><span> and will never return," Alexander reassured her with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava nodded, grateful as she hugged him tightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Alexander picked up another photo.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was of Lynn, striking a pose that showcased her curves, glancing flirtatiously at the camera.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wow, your mom does know how to attract attention," he said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava's face flushed again, a surprising sensation stirring within her, as if his words hit a sensitive spot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you have a thing for my mom?" she asked, playfully grabbing his crotch at him </span><span>while glaring.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander laughed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Not at all! That would be a bit much, don't you think?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava was about to respond when he leaned in closer and entered her body, leaving her breathless...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Lynn was anxiously trying to reach Victor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After several unanswered calls, she couldn't wait any longer and hurried to Ava's room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing muffled sounds and soft gasps from inside, her face turned crimson.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Those two really have energy!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She muttered before retreating back to her room, her mind involuntarily drifting to the last time she had spied on them, the memory of Alexander's strong physique lingering in her thoughts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ugh, stop it! He's your daughter's boyfriend!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lynn chided herself, temporarily forgetting about Victor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Two hours later, Ava walked into Lynn's room, carrying the video, some revealing photos, and Victor's notebook.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander sat in the living room, relaxed and confident, casually humming to himself while enjoying a smoke.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew with the evidence in hand, Lynn would surely see through Victor's facade.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Taking the opportunity, he retrieved that top-tier gemstone, infusing it into the energy core of his lightsaber's hilt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Whoosh!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The blue gemstone melded seamlessly, the magic circle glowing brightly as the Force around him intensified.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perfect!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Pumped with excitement, Alexander clenched his fists in triumph.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Next, he turned his attention to the mysterious bracelet, consisting of nineteen yellow beads.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The beads were not made of gemstones, jade, gold, or silver. They were made from a unique, slightly resilient material.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He took one yellow bead and carefully attached it to the magic circle at the hilt of his lightsaber.</span></p><div class="pagination">
