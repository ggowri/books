  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The gunfight lasted just over ten minutes, and several senior executives who had the greatest hope of succeeding in the position of president were killed in the fight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Others even committed murder and arson to avenge personal vendettas.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For a moment, the Glory Association was engulfed in flames and chaos.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The current chaotic situation was such that even if Jagger were to come back to life, he would not be able to stop it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's heart was filled with joy and excitement as he finally succeeded in making them kill each other.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>More than half of the people in the Glory Association had been killed and the others were also injured. Only then did Alexander calmly call Alyssa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Jagger is dead. They are fighting fiercely. Act now! Don't miss this great opportunity. Come in directly!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was silence on the other end of the phone for a while, and Alyssa was obviously stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a while, she agreed in surprise, "Okay, we'll attack right away!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After hanging up the phone, Alyssa did not hesitate to bring half of the elite members of the Axe, a total of more than one hundred people, fully armed, driving more than a dozen cars, and rushed towards the Glory Association with great momentum.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Glory Association was already in chaos, and there was no way they could resist the Axe who were attacking like a ferocious beast.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For the Glory Association, it was a devastating disaster.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without any obstruction, the Axe's convoy forced its way into the Glory Association.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>First, there was a burst of random gunfire, killing a few diehards, and the others immediately fled in panic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The people of the Glory Association never dreamed that the Axe would suddenly launch a sneak attack and kill them at their weakest and most critical moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The remaining members of the Glory Association had no choice but to surrender to the Axe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was better to live a miserable life than to die. Besides, the Axe was stronger than the Glory Association. If they resisted stubbornly, they would die.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the help of Alexander, the Axe easily occupied the Glory Association and incorporated the remaining members of the Glory Association.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You are amazing!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elisa was so excited that she could hardly control herself. If there weren't so many people present, she wanted to take off all her clothes and offer her body to Alexander immediately because Elisa felt that she had nothing to repay Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smiled calmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alyssa asked cautiously, "What should we do next?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The boss of the Axe was now completely led by Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander said confidently, "Don't worry, this is just the beginning. Wait for my good news. I will go to Southern Mining now and kill Barton.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then you should go and annex Southern Mining. With the territory and people of the Glory Association and Southern Mining, the Axe will already be the largest force in Mandale Town."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alyssa was shocked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What? You're going to kill the boss of Southern Mining now? But the Glory Association has made too much noise, I'm afraid Southern Mining has already been prepared."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander waved his hand nonchalantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hurry up and deal with the Glory Association. I'm going to find Barton first. Wait for my call anytime."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying that, Alexander </span><span>drove</span><span> away quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alyssa was so excited that she trembled all over and quickly ordered her men.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Everyone, hurry up! First detain them all, leave some people to guard them, and the others form a team and go to Southern Mining at any time."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When the order was issued, everyone was shocked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In addition to annexing the Glory Association tonight, were they going to annex Southern Mining as well?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was incredible!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Axe members worked hard to clean up the mess while most of them prepared to attack again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander drove his BMW and arrived at the headquarters of Southern Mining at lightning speed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although the fight of the Glory Association was fierce, gunfights often occurred in Mandale Town, so they did not arouse the vigilance of Southern Mining.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the boss of Southern Mining, Barton was accustomed to enjoying a good life and had long lost his sense of crisis.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought he was already a powerful force in Mandale Town and had joined forces </span><span>with Paxton. With Mafia as their backing, no one dared to hurt them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, Alexander sneaked into Barton's bedroom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A fat man with a round head and big ears was lying on the bed, snoring and sleeping soundly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What a fool!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander appeared in front of Barton silently, and without any nonsense, he raised his hand and fired a shot, blowing Barton's head off.</span></p><div class="pagination">
