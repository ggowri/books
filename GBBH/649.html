  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It concerned everyone's lives and the future of the Axe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rubbing her temples, Alyssa sighed softly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay, the meeting is over now. Everyone goes back and stores up energy. Remember to be vigilant and don't let anyone take advantage of you. Stanley, take action as soon as possible and win over other gangs besides the Mafia."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alyssa sounded exhausted as if there was no hope at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under her leadership, the Axe went from being unknown to rising in Mandale Town; she led her brothers and sisters to gain what they had now under the rain of blood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Never had she thought that she would be like a loser and give up her interests to survive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alyssa felt deeply humiliated and swore that she would avenge herself and make the Mafia pay back tenfold or even a hundredfold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The atmosphere in the conference room was extremely solemn, and a deep sense of powerlessness enveloped everyone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the face of the absolute gap of strength, feeling helpless was the only thing they could do.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With serious expressions, the top leaders of the Axe prepared to leave in heavy steps.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, they heard footsteps from the corridor, and then the door of the conference room was pushed; Alexander walked in with a swagger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Excuse me, everyone. Sorry to bother you. Maybe I'm not welcomed here, but I personally treat the Axe as my friend, so here's a little piece of advice," he said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who are you!?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone was shocked. This meeting was about the future of the Axe Gang, and they didn't expect a stranger to break in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next second, several people pulled out their pistols or daggers and surrounded Alexander aggressively.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment they saw his inappropriate movements, they would tear him apart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Bianchi, may I?" Alexander looked at the surprised Alyssa and smiled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Put down your guns! This is my distinguished guest, and also the guest of the Axe."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alyssa quickly demanded everyone to put down their guns.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Distinguished guest?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite their confusion, after hearing their boss' words, those people finally slowly </span><span>put down their weapons.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, they didn't turn friendly to him. This distinguished guest was too unruly and barged in without permission. He deserved to die.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Wang, how did you get in?" Alyssa asked doubtfully, wondering why he appeared here silently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This building was the meeting building of the Axe and was heavily guarded, especially at the entrance of the meeting room, where there were seven or eight guards and secret sentries.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Normally, no one could sneak in here quietly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the guards outside didn't alert her to his coming at all, and Alexander walked in. Alyssa was really shocked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smiled and said, "You looked a little weird after you answered the phone, so I came to take a look. I heard what you just said. The Mafia has joined forces with other gangs in Mandalay to deal with you. In fact, I should be the fuse of this matter, and of course, I can't stand idly by."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a brief pause, Alexander confidently assured them, "Don't worry, I will do my best to help you through this difficult time and break the Mafia's alliance."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After hearing what Alexander said, everyone present, including Alyssa, was a little speechless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The walls of the conference room were made of steel plates and had a high level of sound absorption treatment. People outside couldn't hear any sound from inside. They all wondered how this man heard their conversation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, he arrogantly announced that he would help the Axe by breaking the Mafia's league. They doubted whether he was talking in his dream.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, they had no idea that Paxton was like an ant that could be smashed by Alexander as long as he wanted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only Alyssa was surprised and looked at him with expectations.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She knew Alexander's capability better than others. After all, he disabled Ian and successfully dodged the assassination while carrying two people.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But even with his strength, she doubted whether he could really take care of the Mafia for her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne, can you tell me your plan?" Alyssa asked tentatively.</span></p><div class="pagination">
