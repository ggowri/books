  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Asher stormed back to his residence, seething with anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Bang!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He kicked over the table with a loud crash.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Prepare the men! Tomorrow morning, we're heading to West Cemetery, and we're digging up the grave of Alexander's family!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>One of his subordinates hesitated and reminded him, "But what if the Lawson family sides with Alexander? Plus, Alexander is skilled, and his influence in Loscity is strong."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Heh..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Asher sneered wickedly, "Don't worry. I've arranged for support from the military, and I've already spoken with the commissioner of the Loscity police department, Oliver.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"When the time comes, if Alexander dares show up with his gang, they'll all be eliminated, leaving no one alive."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Brilliant, Mr. Vance! Absolutely brilliant! With the military and police backing us, Alexander, that gangster, won't be able to cause any trouble. He'll have no choice but to surrender."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His subordinates immediately flattered him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Asher cursed venomously, "Damn it. I'll personally cripple him when the time comes. Let's see if he dares to fight me for a woman again."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The night passed quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Early the next morning, the usually deserted West Cemetery was bustling with activity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dozens of black sedans lined the parking lot, parked neatly in a row, exuding an imposing aura.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, the cars were empty. Clearly, their passengers had already disembarked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Asher arrived at West Cemetery with an old man, along with a group of burly men, all radiating a menacing air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The old man was Axel Vance, Asher's grandpa, the patriarch of the Vance family. He had flown in on a private jet overnight. Today, their goal was to dig up Alexander's mother's grave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Grandson, are you ready?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Axel asked Asher.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Asher replied with a sinister smile, "Don't worry, Grandpa. Most of our men are already in position, a fully reinforced company. Commissioner Oliver has also been notified, and his men are on the way."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Excellent. This plot is ideal and will greatly benefit the Vance family's future prosperity. When my time comes, I must be buried here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Axel nodded with great satisfaction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Asher, meanwhile, was already envisioning Alexander bowing, begging for mercy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ryder, accompanied by a dozen men carrying shovels, approached Asher's group with a sycophantic grin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Axel Vance, this way, please. Watch your step.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Asher Vance, be careful with the stairs."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ryder fawned over them like a lapdog.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Axel and Asher walked with their heads held high, radiating arrogance. They didn't even spare Ryder a glance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They had long been accustomed to being flattered. To them, Ryder was nothing more than a lowly servant, not worth their attention.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Don't waste time. Go dig the grave, quickly!" Axel ordered excitedly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Don't worry, Mr. Axel Vance. The grave is just ahead, and we will be there soon. Please walk carefully."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ryder eagerly led the way like a dog, practically wagging his tail with enthusiasm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this time, Asher scanned the area, noticing Alexander was nowhere in sight. He smirked mockingly, "Haha, that coward Alexander must be too afraid to show up."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing this, everyone laughed derisively.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"There it is. That's Alexander's mother's grave."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ryder pointed to a weathered, rough tombstone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Everyone, get ready and start digging the grave immediately!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The dozen men accompanying Ryder grabbed their shovels and surrounded the grave, eager to impress the Vance family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Stop! What do you want to do?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A furious voice suddenly rang out, and a figure rushed forward to block them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ryder thought it was Alexander, but when he turned to look, it was Lennox.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Lennox's face was flushed with rage as he shouted, "What do you think you're doing? What right do you have to dig up the dead? The deceased have already found peace, and you're... you're condemning yourselves to hell with this!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before Asher could respond, Ryder pointed at Lennox and cursed, "Lennox, you lunatic! Don't you know the cemetery has been purchased by Mr. Asher Vance? Do you still think you're still the director?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You are no longer the director. I am! Get out of here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Slap!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Lennox's hand struck Ryder's face with a forceful slap, leaving him dazzled and nearly toppling to the ground.</span></p><div class="pagination">
