  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Vance family was no joke. As one of the most powerful families in </span><span>Kingsdon</span><span>, their influence and strength were undeniable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Vance family is going to pay for this tenfold," Betty snarled through gritted teeth, her pretty face twisted with cold fury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Philip hesitated, glancing at her. "So... are we not going to counterattack?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Betty furrowed her </span><span>brows,</span><span> Alexander's orders echoing in her mind. After a moment of silence, she let out a long sigh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Not yet. We wait. Let them puff up with pride and overconfidence. If we let them think they're winning, they'll come straight to our doorstep. And when they do, not a single one of them will leave alive."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Philip opened his mouth as if to argue but quickly closed it. His heart was heavy with unease.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"When has the Ultimate Alliance ever been pushed this far?" he thought. "Are the Vance family really this untouchable?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His frustration boiled over. "Why don't we just gather all our forces and crush them now? If we strike first, we can wipe them out before they dig their claws any deeper!" he growled, his teeth clenched so tightly the words barely escaped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Betty took a deep breath, keeping her tone measured. "Philip, calm down. Trust the boss. He's not leading us astray. The plan is to let them think they're winning, let them destroy a few of our bars, nightclubs, or warehouses if they must. It'll only make their defeat more satisfying when the time comes."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Philip </span><span>frowned,</span><span> his frustration clear. "It's not that I don't trust you or the boss, but if we keep giving ground, other gangs will think we're weak. They'll see the Ultimate </span><span>Alliance as prey. We'll turn into a carcass with every scavenger dog looking for a bite."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Betty tightened her grip on her wine glass, her knuckles whitening. She spoke softly but firmly. "I didn't expect the Vance family to move so soon after their failure with the Brilliant Group. But the boss is resolute. We wait. They'll come to us."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Philip fell silent, his face pale and tense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry. The boss knows what he's doing," Betty reassured him, exhaling deeply to steady herself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The hall fell quiet, the air heavy with tension.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bang!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The door burst open, splintering as a group of heavily armed men stormed in, their weapons at the ready. They swiftly encircled Betty and her crew.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The intruders were imposing, their broad shoulders and stern expressions radiating menace. On their uniforms, embroidered in vivid red, was a single word: "Vance."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, this is the so-called Ultimate Alliance of </span><span>Loscity</span><span>? Pathetic. You're nothing but trash," Asher mocked, sauntering in with an arrogant swagger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The armed men saluted him before stepping aside, clearing a path as he approached.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Betty sneered. "Asher, you've got guts coming here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At her words, dozens of Ultimate Alliance elites emerged from the back, quickly forming a protective wall around her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Outside the hall, the Vance forces surrounded the building in a sea of black uniforms and loaded firearms. But Betty's confidence didn't waver.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The standoff crackled with tension, an unspoken battle hanging in the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Asher," Betty snapped, her eyes blazing, "you think you can just march into our headquarters and make demands? Do you really think you can steal the formula for the magic powder?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Asher's greedy eyes roved over her, and a slimy grin spread across his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Rowe, you're a sharp one. Surrender now, and I might just let you live. I don't know where Alexander is hiding, but even if he comes for you, it'll be too late.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Join me, become my woman, and I'll make sure you live a life of wealth and luxury. What do you say?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The lecherous gleam in his eyes made Betty's skin crawl.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She spat on the floor in front of him. "In your dreams."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Asher's face darkened, and he growled, "You think this is just about the formula? You couldn't be more wrong. I'm here to crush the Ultimate Alliance and Alexander with it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you don't surrender, you'll be the bait that lures him straight into my trap!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Betty's icy glare could have frozen fire as she fought to suppress her simmering rage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Asher's already here," she thought. "But where is Alexander? Why hasn't he shown up yet?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Asher," Betty said aloud, her voice like steel, "this is the Ultimate Alliance's headquarters, not some playground for the Vance family. If you think we'll surrender, you'll have to prove you've got what it takes to bring us down."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her words were resolute, and fire burned in her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had pledged herself entirely to Alexander&mdash;his loyal subordinate, his unwavering partner, and his devoted woman. For him, she would fight to the death before even considering surrender.</span></p><div class="pagination">
