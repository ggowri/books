  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The trees and plants touched by the venom emitted black smoke, withering instantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even the hard cement ground showed deep pits with signs of burning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Alexander was too fast. The moment the black snake opened its mouth to spray venom, he had already retreated several meters back, hiding behind a large tree.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing the potency of the snake's venom, Alexander became cautious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just a single drop could cause serious harm, even with the Force protecting him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The dark wizard was indeed formidable&mdash;not only skilled but wielding such terrifying creatures.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Drake seemed to have aged ten years in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His wrinkled old face cracked like a dried-out wasteland, with deep blood-streaked lines appearing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed the black snake's venom took a heavy toll on his energy as well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's lips curled into a cold smile as he flicked more pebbles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a hissing screech, two more black snakes were hit, bleeding and thrashing on the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Using his speed, Alexander launched a guerrilla assault. Each time Drake paused, Alexander would strike with Force-powered pebbles, killing a few more snakes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Furious, Drake commanded the snakes to spit venom in retaliation, but not a single drop touched Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a few rounds, the dozens of strange black snakes were reduced to only a handful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Drake himself was nearly spent, his entire body trembling uncontrollably.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander still looked relaxed. He had only used a fraction of his Force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When the final black snake was killed, Drake collapsed to his knees, gasping for air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This can't be! I'm a dark wizard... how could I lose to you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Black blood gushed from Drake's mouth, staining his chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander! Are you really going to kill me? Think carefully&mdash;I'm a dark wizard of the City of Sorcery. If they find out, you'll face endless pursuit."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander looked at him with cold disdain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You took Guzman's order to kill me. You should have known the price of failure. If it were me on my knees now, would you let me live?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Drake's face twisted with hatred. He suddenly tore off his robe, revealing his emaciated body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His skeletal frame was covered in twisted scars, like dried tree bark.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he chanted a strange spell, the scars on his body began to move, transforming into monstrous faces, as if they were about to crawl out of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Still trying tricks when you're at death's door?" Alexander glared at him, not foolish enough to let him complete his sorcery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He threw a handful of Force-infused pebbles. Bang, bang, bang!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Poor Drake was hit as if he'd been shot by a machine gun, his body bursting into a bloody pulp, riddled with holes straight through.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Black blood oozed out, filling the air with a foul stench.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Drake lay on the ground, unable to move, spewing black blood from his mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In each mouthful of black blood, small, worm-like black snakes squirmed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had nurtured these black snakes in his body, linked to him physically and spiritually.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each snake's death inflicted severe pain on Drake.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lying in his own black blood, he was barely breathing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander walked over, intending to check if Drake had anything useful on him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he approached, he suddenly paused, sneering. "Damn wizard, trying to have a black snake latch onto me, huh?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Drake suddenly lifted his head to glare venomously at Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the black pool beside him, several snakes began writhing again, crawling desperately toward Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without hesitation, Alexander used the Force to ignite them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A burst of Force engulfed the black blood, and flames roared up instantly.</span></p><div class="pagination">
