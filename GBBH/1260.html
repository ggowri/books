  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander kept his eyes locked on the figure. He took a deep breath, channeled the Force, and hurled his Lightsabers with explosive power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The glowing blades streaked through the air like lightning, instantly appearing behind the stranger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though the figure stood nearly 220 yards away, Alexander's Lightsabers closed the distance in a heartbeat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only then did the Lightsabers make </span><span>its</span><span> signature sound, tearing through the air with a piercing shriek.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The stranger was agile, but Alexander's attack came with such ferocity that by the time he noticed, it was too late to dodge completely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He managed to twist away, barely avoiding a fatal blow. The Lightsabers sliced through one of his arms, sending blood spraying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander rushed forward and, with a gesture, called his Lightsabers back to his hand through the Force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before the man in black could scramble to his feet, Alexander was already there, pinning him down with a boot to the chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The beast tide had fallen into chaos. Though some beasts still attacked Louvian Port, many had fle</span><span>d</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Karson and his people, who had nearly lost all hope, were overcome with joy. They knew Alexander must have turned the tide somehow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite their lingering anxiety, they could finally see the light of victory ahead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tell me," Alexander demanded in an icy voice. "Was Yinson behind this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The mysterious figure's cloak fell away, revealing a face as gaunt as a skeleton.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Heh</span><span>.</span><span>" He fixed Alexander with a grotesque smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander stomped down hard, instantly breaking two of the man's ribs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But instead of screaming, </span><span>he just</span><span> let out an eerie laugh. Even with broken ribs piercing his chest cavity and blood pouring from his mouth, he showed no sign of pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's brow furrowed. This had to be one of the Sakra Society's test subjects&mdash;probably engineered to control mutant beasts. These subjects had lost their ability to feel pain, and likely any human emotions at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man suddenly let out a bestial howl, lunging like a wolf to bite Alexander's leg.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander reacted with lightning speed. He unleashed the Force in a violent burst, hitting the man like a sledgehammer to the chest and sending him flying backward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the man wouldn't give up. He struggled to his feet and charged again like a rabid dog.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander frowned. This clearly wasn't a rational human anymore. Yinson had turned him into a monster.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a swift motion, Alexander swung his Lightsaber and severed the man's head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The head rolled away, </span><span>but </span><span>that twisted smile still frozen on its face. The headless body collapsed, blood gushing like a fountain from the neck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment </span><span>he</span><span> fell dead, all the mutant beasts turned tail and fled, scattering into the darkness. Their earlier bloodthirsty rage had vanished completely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then came the thundering sound of engines.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dozens of military helicopters appeared on the horizon, racing toward Louvian Port.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Headlights pierced the darkness in the distance as at least a hundred military vehicles approached the port.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A heavy silence fell over the survivors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For a moment, all they could hear was each other's heavy breathing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, someone broke into a cheer. "We've got rescue coming! We're gonna live!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Karson grabbed Norah's hand, tears of joy streaming down his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We made it! We actually won!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hell yeah!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>People erupted in celebration, waving their arms and jumping up and down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They hugged each other, almost delirious with relief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But as their cheers died down and they took in the devastating battlefield before them, silence fell once again. Some quietly wiped away tears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sure, the rescue had finally arrived. But the cost was unbearable. Only half of their original thousand remained.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They'd be lucky if a few thousand residents survived in Louvian. That was the price paid in blood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fiona dropped her gun, her face blank, all traces of joy vanishing from her expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her heart felt like it was being crushed by a boulder as she stumbled toward the crevice where Oswald had disappeared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crack was still there, impossibly deep and dark, but there wasn't even a shadow of Oswald to be seen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fiona stood there silently, tears streaming down her face uncontrollably.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She looked like a shell of herself. Her devastation and despair were a stark contrast to everyone else's excitement and joy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oswald..." she whispered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at the blood spattered on the ground and the broken rope, Fiona finally broke down into gut-wrenching sobs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her cries cut through the celebration, drawing everyone's attention. The joyful atmosphere quickly died down as tears welled up in their eyes.</span></p><div class="pagination">
