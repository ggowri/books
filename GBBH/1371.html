  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vegeta stood to the side and bowed respectfully toward Alexander. "Mr. Hawthorne, Mr. Wetherall is truly a capable man. Everything in the manor is well-organized and running smoothly."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander took a sip of tea. "Vegeta, how are your people?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A look of gratitude crossed Vegeta's face. "Thanks to you, they're all settled in at the manor, living peacefully. I took the liberty of selecting a hundred strong men from among them to serve as guards."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Good!" Alexander nodded approvingly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If we don't want to be pushed around, we need our own forces. Your people are all battle-hardened warriors. Having them as guards is hardly a waste of their skills. Once we've built up an elite force of a thousand, you and Nova will take command as captains, and they can serve as squad leaders." He paused for a moment before adding in a measured tone, "If any of them prove to be loyal and reliable, I might even teach them some martial arts."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vegeta and Nova exchanged glances, then bowed deeply. "Thank you, Mr. Hawthorne!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Logan frowned slightly. "Alexander, we only have about 800 households, a little over 4,000 people. Should we find a way to bring in more? The manor has enough space to house tens of thousands. That would also make recruiting soldiers easier."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander nodded in agreement. "You're right. When we have time, we'll take another trip to the slave market and see if there are any suitable candidates."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, as the group discussed manor affairs, deep in the birch forest west of Kean Manor, a burly man stood watching from a distance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A black scarf was wrapped around his head, and he wore a short brown combat tunic. His large hands and feet, along with his fierce, tiger-like eyes, gave him an imposing presence. He stared intently at Kean Manor, murmuring to himself, "I've been waiting for you for so long... and you finally showed up."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he turned and disappeared into the depths of the forest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That night, under a sky filled with scattered stars, a force of several hundred men advanced toward Kean Manor from the western mountains.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the front of the group was the same burly man, riding a magnificent white stallion. Its coat was pure as snow, without a single blemish.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He held the reins in one hand and a gleaming nine-ringed saber in the other.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Behind him were fifty to sixty elite cavalrymen clad in steel chainmail, each carrying a torch and a steel saber. Their warhorses were also equipped with powerful crossbows.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Following the riders, over three hundred foot soldiers marched in silence, clad in fine leather armor. They carried long spears with red tassels, and among them, several men hauled crude wooden ladders.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both men and horses were trained for stealth. The grass was stuffed in their mouths, and metal bits were removed to prevent noise. The entire force moved in eerie silence, the only sounds being the faint rustle of footsteps and the occasional snort of a warhorse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These were elite soldiers, hardened warriors who had seen countless battles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Half an hour later, the group reached the birch forest outside Kean Manor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A young rider from the elite cavalry spurred his horse forward and whispered to the burly man, "Father, should we raise the battle flag?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man nodded, glancing at the young rider. In a low voice, he said, "Be careful. The target this time is only a level-three warrior, but he once survived a fight against someone nearly at level five. He could be tricky. Though, from what I've heard, he's already crippled... maybe I'm overthinking it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Turning his horse around, he lifted his nine-ringed saber, signaling the troops to halt. Then, in a deep voice, he ordered, "Storm Kean Manor. Leave no one alive! Fifty coins for every man!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The promise of coins sent a jolt through the ranks, and the soldiers swallowed hard in anticipation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The burly man fixed his gaze on the manor ahead. As the young rider raised a large black banner emblazoned with the word "Tiger," he gave the signal. The army surged forward, charging toward Kean Manor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At a distance of about 620 miles from the manor, Josh noticed the tall manor walls lined with burning torches. There were sentries standing guard, seemingly armed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He scoffed. Probably just for show. His Tiger Gang had raided enough manors to know the difference.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At 560 miles, a sharp, urgent bell rang out from Wetherall Manor, piercing the quiet night and echoing for miles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Josh cursed under his breath. Looks like they had to move fast. If the Darwin garrison arrived, things would get complicated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He dug his heels into his horse's flanks, and the stallion let out a sharp whinny before surging forward like an arrow released from a bow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At 430 miles, flames erupted from a small signal tower on the manor walls. Smoke spiraled into the sky like a fiery tornado.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The young flag bearer felt a pang of unease. Was this really just a simple manor? A warning bell? A signal tower?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At 310 miles, more figures appeared on the manor walls. Two Hrodvik men, one tall and one stout, along with two white men, one of average build and the other a towering giant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At 120 miles, Josh leaped from his horse. A fiery red aura of protective energy flared around him as he gripped his nine-ringed saber, soaring toward the manor walls like a hunting falcon.</span></p><div class="pagination">
