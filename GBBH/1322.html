  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ladies and gentlemen, hear me out! Iron Vanguard is the second-largest escort agency in the continent. After you enter the Outer Court, you can join us. The monthly salary starts at a hundred coins. Reach level-two warrior, and it jumps to a thousand. Hit level three, and you'll be making two thousand dollars a month..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Nonsense! We, Four Seas Agency, are the number one! Join us, and we'll double whatever they're offering!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Four Seas... don't push your luck..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Listen up, everyone! Those who reach level-one warriors can enter the Royal Guards. Level-two warriors become captains, level-three warriors serve as commanders, and level-four..." Meanwhile, a few short men dressed in Risunese attire were bowing at everyone they saw, shouting in heavily accented Hrodvik. "We are merchants from the Oceanic Federation, offering positions to young talents. Join our Chamber of Commerce, and the monthly salary is at least 2,200 coins..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone kept their distance from them. "My goodness, how come there are Risunese pirates?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Those are not pirates. They are just Risunese merchants in our land!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who in their right mind would go to that godforsaken place? Anyone who does is asking for trouble!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander couldn't help but sigh. National unity remained unshakable as long as a country was prosperous and its people lived in peace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, the grand vermillion gates of the Outer Court slowly swung open.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>More than a hundred people came out from inside, including guards, novices, and resident priests from the management hall. The group set up dozens of long tables under the steps, with paper, ink, and brushes ready on the tables.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The leading middle-aged priest glanced at the people outside and roared, "The Dominion Church's Outer Court lay disciples selection begins now! Register your place of origin, sign the life-and-death waiver, and enter in order. No cutting in line, no disturbances!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander said to Logan, "There are too many people here. You go back and wait for my good news."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, Alex! I'm heading back to the manor. I'll have drinks ready for you!" Logan didn't stand on ceremony and made his way back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, deep within the Dominion Church's Outer Court, three men overseeing the selection sat in the grand hall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the left were two middle-aged priests clad in crimson robes. One held a palm-size bible, his expression unreadable. He was Declan of the Hina Sect, known among the common folk as the reincarnation of the Dragon-Subduing Saint.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beside Declan was Huxley, who was built like a mountain. He had broad hands and massive feet. He gripped a ceremonial ring in one hand. He was also a priest of the Hina Sect, said to be the return of the Tiger-Taming Saint.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To their right sat a man with a square face, thick eyebrows, and piercing eyes. A long beard draped down his chin. He wore a black suit with a purple court robe and a golden badge at his waist. He was none other than the Minister of Defense, Fermin Schneier, who was appointed by the Emperor to oversee the assessment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fermin was a renowned general of his time, rising to the position of Minister of Defense. He was gallant and chivalrous in his youth, fiercely intolerant of injustice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When the Noah Empire launched their Crusades, putting the nation in peril, Fermin resolutely abandoned his scholar career for a suit of armor, rushing to the battlefield. At Swallow Gate, he offered a strategy to Quinton, inflicting a great defeat on the allied forces of the Noah Empire. His loyalty, bravery, and resourcefulness were awe-inspiring, shaking the world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Father Declan, how many of these candidates do you think will make it as Outer Court disciples this time?" Fermin asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Becoming an Outer Court disciple of the Dominion Church is no easy feat. I'd wager barely one in a hundred will make the cut," Declan replied, shaking head with a faint smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Entering the Outer Court is merely the starting point of one's martial path," Huxley added, twirling his ceremonial ring with a hearty laugh. "Reaching level-five warrior and even ascending to the divine transformation stage is as arduous as moving mountains and draining seas!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The three examiners chatted idly while outside; the waiting crowd, whether high-ranking officials or tycoons wealthy enough to rival nations, dared not break order. They obediently lined up, registering their place of origin one by one before stepping into the Outer Court to await the assessment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander followed the crowd into the Outer Court, weaving through a long, winding corridor that stretched for miles. The passage was exquisitely crafted, leading to a grand and imposing hall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The hall spanned thousands of feet in length and width, capable of accommodating tens of thousands of people.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, it was packed wall to wall, shoulder to shoulder, buzzing with discussion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking ahead, one could vaguely see a vermilion-arched doorway deep within the hall, seemingly exuding a vibe of ferocity, ruthlessness, and dominance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone in the hall was fixated on that doorway. They were all level-one warriors, their senses razor-sharp. It was obvious to them that whatever lay beyond that door was the true battleground for selection.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's behind that vermillion gateway?" Alexander wondered, his heart tightening. "Could it be the legendary Thunderclap Bronze Men said to rival even level-three warrior?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Silence!" A middle-aged monastic soldier roared, and the hall instantly fell silent, the atmosphere becoming heavy and tense.</span></p><div class="pagination">
