  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Stop! I will kill whoever dares to cause trouble at the Brilliant Group!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A furious roar sounded from the crowd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The crowd parted like the tide, and a group of massive men surrounded Oscar, who was walking toward them with an imposing presence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"That's Oscar Stewart, the leader of The Kaylon's branch in Loscity," someone whispered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ah!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Suddenly, a scream rang out. One of the people talking was kicked to the ground by Fairchild.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Fairchild's men rushed forward, beating the unlucky soul mercilessly, the scream echoing through the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Savage Tiger Clan's arrogance and brutality were on full display.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'm here to ask Mr. Hawthorne to heal me. Anyone who opposes Mr. Hawthorne is asking for trouble with Savage Tiger Clan," Fairchild said, his eyes cold as he fixed his gaze on Skyla.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Just then, a clear and melodic voice interrupted the tension.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Who dares to challenge Alexander? I'll shoot him dead!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Rebecca's voice rang out as she arrived with the men of the Hansen family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon, half of Loscity's top elites arrived with their subordinates, surrounding the Vanderbilt family members.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Among the crowd were billionaires, influential figures, and top-tier gangsters.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Some had come to offer help. And others, like Fairchild, had come seeking Alexander's medical skills.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Fairchild had already tried to see Alexander before, but Alexander had ignored him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Now, Fairchild saw an opportunity to get Alexander's attention.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the blink of an eye, over a dozen powerful figures and their thousands of followers had surrounded the Vanderbilt family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ultimate Alliance, led by Betty, also arrived, forming an impenetrable circle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was clear that no matter how powerful Skyla was, she could not leave there easily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Vanderbilt family had been accustomed to being untouchable in Capital Region. They never imagined they would face such overwhelming odds, and now they were trembling in fear, shaking like helpless sheep surrounded by a pack of hungry wolves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If it weren't for the fact that they were in public, the Vanderbilt family might have already been wiped out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone knew that Alexander was a man of his word. Anyone who helped him would be rewarded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As the creator of magic powders and beauty ointments, a simple would from Alexander could bring huge profits.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Besides, Oscar, Rebecca, and the others would always stand by Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Arlene's face turned pale. She quietly distanced herself from Skyla.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although Skyla's face was also grim, she remained composed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She looked haughtily at the powerful figures around her and shouted, "I'm from the Vanderbilt family. Anyone who is against me will be punished! How could he, a grown man, be afraid of a woman like me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Fairchild sneered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Skyla, this is Loscity, not Capital Region. You have no room to be reckless here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You'd better stop talking. Once I take care of you, Mr. Hawthorne will surely look at me differently. Maybe he'll finally help me with my illness."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A chilling and murderous intent filled the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing that the situation was escalating, even though Skyla was confident in her poison, she knew that if everyone charged at once, she was done for.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Suddenly, an unexpected event occurred.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Fairchild, who had been so menacing just moments ago, suddenly started coughing violently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He spat out a mouthful of blood and then collapsed as a deflated balloon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Torres!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Torres, what's happening to you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His men rushed forward, lifting him in a panic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Some tried to administer medicine, while others quickly called for an ambulance. The scene was chaotic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Fairchild was too agitated. He was already in the late stages of cancer, so..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Such a pity, he was still in his prime, but cancer took him. He's beyond saving."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I've heard Alexander is a genius doctor. If he helps, there might be a chance."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>People murmured in confusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The ambulance arrived soon after.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At that moment, Fairchild suddenly spat another mouthful of blood, his body twitching uncontrollably.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The doctors, sweating profusely, shouted urgently, "Quick! Give him adrenaline. His heart's stopped!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The crowd gasped in shock. No one had thought that the leader of Harmocia's strongest gang would die just like this in Loscity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The doctors were exhausted and their faces were full of despair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Despite all their efforts, Fairchild's body showed no signs of life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It looked like he had died.</span></p><div class="pagination">
