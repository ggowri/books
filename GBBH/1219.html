  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the surface, Jonah claimed he was here to get justice for Gael. But his real agenda? He saw Alexander as nothing more than a stepping stone - someone he could use to climb higher up the ladder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Too bad Jonah was being way too optimistic. Alexander wasn't the kind of guy they could just push around.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The call to assemble echoed through the area as everyone geared up for the raid.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had fifty metahumans, including Jonah and Ilona, backed by a hundred special ops troops.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander stood at the center of the crowd, his piercing gaze landing on Jonah.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quentin had already filled him in about Jonah's little crusade to defend Gael's honor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The massive sword strapped to Jonah's shoulder was hard to miss, and he was practically radiating killer vibes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he caught Alexander staring him down, a chill ran down his spine, and his hair stood on end.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just one look from Alexander had him breaking into a cold sweat</span><span>&mdash;</span><span>the pressure was intense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jonah's eyes narrowed to slits, a deadly glint flickering behind them. He wanted to use Alexander as a test of strength, and the tougher Alexander turned out to be, the better.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jonah let out a dark chuckle as he fired up his powers. The crushing pressure he'd been feeling suddenly lifted, leaving him feeling light as a feather.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Huh, this guy has actually got some real skills</span><span>&mdash;</span><span>almost reminds me of Felix back in the day," Alexander murmured, mildly impressed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he quickly brushed off the comparison. After all, even Felix had met his end at Alexander's hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Besides, Alexander was an Advanced Warrior now. He'd come a long way since those days.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sure, Jonah might be tough compared to the average fighter, but Alexander was playing in a whole different league.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, Quentin raised his arm, and the room went dead quiet. All eyes locked onto him, waiting for his words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the military, orders were orders. Alexander had to admit that Quentin knew how to run a tight ship.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Everyone, I'm sure you all understand how crucial tonight's raid is. I'll be leading the team personally, along with Mr. Hawthorne, Colonel Jonah, and Colonel Ilona.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This operation is critical to our future. Success is the only option, and that means following orders to the letter."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After wrapping up his speech, Quentin fixed Jonah and Ilona with a stern look before scanning the entire group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The room fell dead silent</span><span>&mdash;</span><span>you could feel the tension in the air with the upcoming battle looming over them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone except Alexander seemed to be feeling the weight of what was coming.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It made sense</span><span>&mdash;</span><span>Sakra Society had developed some serious enhancement drugs from the Immortality Serum, creating test subjects with crazy abilities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Trying to snatch the pure Immortality Serum from their secret base wasn't going to be a walk in the park. They were in for one hell of a fight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't for nothing that the command had put together an assault team with fifty metahumans.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If everyone's ready, let's move out," Quentin said, turning on his heel and heading for the exit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The team fell in line behind him, making their way to the helicopters for the mountain drop.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was the dead of night, with thick clouds rolling across the sky, occasionally revealing glimpses of the crescent moon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A fleet of transport choppers thundered through the air, skimming over the dense forest canopy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They quickly reached their target zone, and one by one, the assault team members started rappelling down from the open bay doors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The landing went smoothly enough, except for a few guys who twisted their ankles on touchdown.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quentin and Alexander led the group, pushing hard toward the summit at top speed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll go clear out their sentries," Alexander said coolly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thanks, Alexander. I'm counting on you," Quentin agreed without hesitation. If anyone could sneak up to the base and spot their hidden lookouts, it was Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As everyone watched with a mix of awe and tension, they caught glimpses of Alexander's figure darting through the woods about </span><span>fifty yards</span><span> out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was approaching the outer perimeter of the Sakra Society's secret base. There would definitely be hidden sentries posted around, and he'd need to take them all out quietly if he wanted to catch the main force off guard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"General Thompson, please let me go too." Jonah stepped forward eagerly. He was itching for a chance to go head-to-head with Alexander, to see who </span><span>really was</span><span> </span><span>the better operative.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The way Alexander had vanished into thin air had gotten under Jonah's skin. Finally, here was someone who might actually give him a real challenge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quentin hesitated for a moment before giving a nod.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, Jonah wasn't just good. He was ranked number one among all fifty metahumans in their unit.</span></p><div class="pagination">
