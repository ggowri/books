  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As they passed a store, Norma suddenly stopped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Wait a second, I forgot to grab my swimsuit. I'm going to buy one."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She walked into the store, leaving Alexander to wait outside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A few minutes later, she returned, holding a shopping bag with a sexy bikini, along with beach pants and slippers for Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They made their way toward the yacht docks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A group of young men was hanging out by a yacht, surrounded by a crowd of bikini-clad women.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As soon as the men saw Norma, they stopped flirting and stared at her in shock. One of them, a muscular guy with a crew cut, walked over confidently, ignoring Alexander completely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Hey, shawty, how's it going? May I know your name?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Norma's smile instantly faded, replaced by a cold stare. She ignored him completely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The man froze for a moment, then his anger flared. But he kept his tone polite, trying to mask his frustration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Gorgeous, are you going out on the water? I just bought a luxury yacht&mdash;worth over ten million dollars. I've got a barbecue and fine wine ready. If you join me on the yacht, I'll give you a hundred thousand dollars. How about it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Norma's fury boiled over. "Do you take me for a prostitute? I have a yacht. Get lost."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She turned to leave, but the man blocked her path.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"How dare you ignore my invitation?" he shouted, his voice rising with irritation. "Do you know who I am?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At that, Alexander spoke coldly. "Are you deaf? My girl told you to leave."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The man finally looked at Alexander, sizing him up with a sneer. "And who the hell are you? You'd better get lost now. Your woman is mine."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Without warning, Alexander shoved him, sending the man crashing to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Luckily, the sand cushioned his fall, but he still landed heavily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Damn, you can fight!" the man spat, clearly furious. He got up, forced a smile, and said, "Alright, I'll make you an offer. One million dollars. Let your girl come with us, and you can pick two of these bitches to join you. How's that sound?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He gestured toward the dozen women standing nearby, thinking Alexander would jump at the offer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Fuck off," Alexander muttered, irritation clear in his voice. This guy was beyond ridiculous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The man's companions, furious now, began closing in around Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A fat man stepped forward, shouting, "Do you know who Mr. Hunter is? He's the heir to the Hunter family in Kylaville! He invited you to join our yacht party, and you refuse? Are you trying to get yourself killed?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander's patience snapped. "What a bunch of idiots. Fuck off."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With a casual wave of his hand, Alexander unleashed a burst of Force Control, a powerful shockwave that sent the group of men flying back into the sand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They tumbled across the beach, their mouths and noses full of sand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What the hell? What's with the wind all of a sudden?" one of them grumbled, brushing sand from his face. They were embarrassed and furious, but more determined than ever to take revenge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Damn you! What did you just do?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Come on, let's beat him up!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You'd better apologize and hand over your woman. If not, we'll break every bone in your body!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As their taunts grew more vicious, Matteo Hunter, standing at the front of the group, glared at Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You want me to leave? No, it's you who needs to get lost. Your woman belongs on my yacht, and if she doesn't come with me, I'll tie you up and throw you in the sea for the sharks."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Matteo's words were venomous. Despite knowing Alexander could fight, he was unwilling to let someone like Norma slip away, especially with the backing of the powerful Hunter family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He knew that with enough bodyguards, they could easily deal with Alexander.</span></p><div class="pagination">
