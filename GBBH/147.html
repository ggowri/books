  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hugh was no amateur; he recognized that Alexander's grip was anything but ordinary.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the speed of Alexander's move left him no time to change tactics.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just moments ago, Hugh had been brimming with confidence. Now, he had to throw all caution to the wind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Summoning every ounce of strength, he felt like he was pushing himself to the absolute limit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two hands clashed violently, and a series of sickening cracks echoed in the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hugh's fingers shattered upon impact, his hand contorting grotesquely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Agonizing pain surged through him, and he instinctively clutched his mangled hand, stumbling back in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander, relentless, pressed forward, landing a forceful palm strike right on Hugh's chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hugh barely let out a grunt before he collapsed, unconscious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sight left Sebastian completely dumbfounded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The so-called top fighter of </span><span>Loscity</span><span> was taken down in mere moments by Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stepping closer to Sebastian, Alexander said coldly, "Sebastian, still not ready to talk? Where's Guzman hiding?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian tilted his chin defiantly. "Go ahead, kill me. I won't betray Guzman!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was trying to exude a sense of bravery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Such loyalty, even in the face of death," Alexander replied with a cynical laugh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He then added, "But let's see how you handle something worse than dying."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander slapped his palm against Sebastian's forehead, and the Force surged into him like a swarm of needles piercing his brain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian stifled a groan. The acute agony racing through him felt unlike anything he had endured before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was as if a legion of daggers had taken residence in his skull, rapidly spreading pain throughout his body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every muscle, every bone, felt like it was being put through the wringer of the harshest torture.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The agony seemed to have settled deep within his soul, tormenting him mercilessly like a relentless shadow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian desperately wanted to scream, but an invisible weight seemed to crush his throat, rendering him unable to voice a single word.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He crumpled to the floor, curling into himself as if trying to protect his very soul from the onslaught of pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander eyed him with utter indifference. This was a man who had committed countless sins and had previously plotted his demise. He felt no sympathy for someone like Sebastian; the torment Sebastian was dishing out was far more fitting than he deserved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Most people feared death because of potential pain, but Sebastian was now </span><span>experiencing suffering that made the prospect of dying seem merciful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Such an unending torment would be unbearable even for the demons of hell!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A few excruciating minutes later, Sebastian's body was convulsing, foam bubbling at his lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was on the brink of breaking. With a rough kick to the side, Alexander withdrew his Force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian lay on the ground, gasping for air, drenched in cold sweat, creating a puddle underneath him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ready to spill your guts? Do you still want to play the tough guy? Trust me, you won't be dying anytime soon unless I let you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A smile graced Alexander's lips, but it was anything but kind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You... you're a monster! An outright monster!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Panic filled Sebastian's eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had never encountered anything like the torment Alexander had unleashed on him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The suffering Sebastian endured now exceeded anything he experienced in the hospital by tenfold, a hundredfold; it felt as if his soul had descended into the very depths of hell, where even the torments there would pale in comparison to this anguish.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Still holding on to that stubbornness, huh?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander raised his hand again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Desperation flooded Sebastian's heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you truly want to be loyal to Guzman?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's patience was wearing thin as he seized Sebastian by the throat, dragging him along like a ragdoll.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No! Please, don't!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian was painfully aware of the consequences of keeping silent; he feared the torture could drive him to madness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Speak!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's voice boomed like thunder rumbling overhead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian's breath came in rapid bursts, his chest heaving.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, alright! I'll tell you! Guzman is crafty, and though he trusts me, I can't always pinpoint his location.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Especially after coming to </span><span>Loscity</span><span>, we only communicate by phone..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before he could finish, a fierce glare from Alexander cut him off. "Don't even think about pulling a fast one!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian waved his hands frantically; desperation etched in his mien.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No! Don't kill me! I know where he spends the most time. Guzman has invested heavily in a secret base out on the water... It's on an island just about 350 miles from </span><span>Tijuan</span><span>e</span><span>a</span><span> in Mexico..."</span></p><div class="pagination">
