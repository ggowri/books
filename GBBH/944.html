  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Daddy, I can't... please, no more. I've already come three times, I almost couldn't keep quiet... just finish, please!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cloe was crying, practically begging&mdash;she just couldn't handle any more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was close too. He gripped her hips hard, pushing for one last burst of intensity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a final surge, Alexander let go, and Cloe let out a high-pitched whimper before collapsing entirely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Alexander hadn't been holding her, she would've crumpled onto the floor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a few minutes of rest, Cloe managed to pull herself together, regaining her composed, elegant CEO demeanor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two of them headed into the auction hall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The room was already packed with over a hundred people, and more guests were constantly arriving.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander and Cloe quietly took seats in the back, staying low-key to observe the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A young woman in the front rows turned her head, her eyes widening in surprise when she saw Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was the same woman from earlier&mdash;the one Alexander had saved. One of the Ghost.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The woman looked excited as she approached Alexander, giving him a slight bow,</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you for saving me this morning. My name is Cynthia Bridges, it's great to see you again!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, she discreetly waved her hand, releasing a fine, colorless powder onto Alexander's leg.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, sure."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander gave a cold smile, watching her every move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Whatever that powder was, probably some drug or poison, it wouldn't work on him&mdash;not with his Force shielding him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Alexander's indifferent response, Cynthia awkwardly returned to her seat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Two seats over from her sat a stern-faced middle-aged man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had a square jaw and an expression like the whole world owed him money.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man exchanged a quick glance with Cynthia before turning to look at Alexander, pretending it was casual.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander could sense the man's murderous intent&mdash;definitely one of Cynthia's associates, clearly a seasoned killer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The middle-aged man smirked, pulling out his phone to type a message.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cynthia was also busy on her phone&mdash;it was obvious they were plotting something.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Heh..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander couldn't help but smile, his eyes clear and amused. To him, they were nothing more than ants.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The higher-ups in the Ghost must really underestimate him if they thought these two could take him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, an auction staff member approached them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He froze for a second when he saw Cloe, clearly shocked to see the CEO attending the auction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cloe leaned in and whispered a few words to him, and he quickly handed over an auction catalog.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Go do your job. Pretend you don't know me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The staff member nodded quickly and walked away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>More and more people were entering the auction hall, and the room, which could fit five hundred, was now more than half full.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, the middle-aged man next to Cynthia kept glaring at Alexander like a hawk.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cloe frowned slightly, a hint of concern in her eyes. The Ghost was no joke&mdash;it represented the interests of some of the most powerful people in the world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If they were targeting Alexander, there was no way they'd send just two small-time operatives.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sir, should I call in some backup?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cloe looked to Alexander, waiting for his decision.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smiled. "No need to worry. I've got this."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He took Cloe's hand and led her forward a few rows, sitting right next to Cynthia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both Cloe, Cynthia, and the middle-aged man were stunned, clearly unsure of what Alexander was planning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Bridges, you keep trying to get close to me, even tried to poison me. What exactly does the Ghost want from me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander suddenly asked, his voice calm and direct.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cynthia nearly jumped out of her seat, her face a mix of shock and confusion. She hadn't expected her cover to be blown so easily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The middle-aged man's eyes went wide, his face full of hostility, ready to make a move at any moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cynthia took a deep breath, trying to stay composed, then sneered,</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, I'll admit you're impressive. But let me give you some advice&mdash;play smart. Hand over the formula for the magic powder and beauty ointments, and give up Treasure Island and Devil Island."</span></p><div class="pagination">
