  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Impossible! This is fake! It's all fake, you liars! You're all liars!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Silas screamed at the top of his lungs, panic evident in his expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He knew Atlas was a well-known lawyer in Newbrook, someone who wouldn't make a move unless he had full confidence in his position.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Atlas shoved the copy of the agreement into Silas' hand with an icy glare.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You better take a good look. We're taking over Silver Shield Security now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Silas' head spun. His hands trembled as he glanced at the document, and the realization hit him like a freight train. His face contorted with disbelief and panic, his eyes widening in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Liars! You're all liars! Don't think you can fool me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With a growl, Silas tore the document into shreds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You think you can just take over Silver Shield? I'll kill you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Like a madman, he lunged at Alexander, claws outstretched.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Get lost!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander casually kicked Silas away, sending him flying across the floor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You liars... you'll never get Silver Shield Security!" Silas spat blood, struggling to get up but failing miserably.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"We don't need to waste time on this idiot. Let's go."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander dismissed Silas with a shrug, stepping over him and leading the way into the building.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Spit!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As they passed by Silas, Alvin spat on him in contempt, and Silas nearly fainted from rage and humiliation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Good deeds bring good rewards, bad deeds bring bad ones," Emma muttered, her eyes filled with disdain as she gave Silas one last glare.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He lay there like a deflated balloon, unmoving.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Maxine, her face expressionless, ignored Silas entirely. Her gaze, however, was fixed intently on Alexander's retreating back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The previous night, she had mustered the courage to knock on his door, only to be shut out. That rejection had left her with a lingering bitterness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With Atlas' help, Alexander quickly took control of Silver Shield Security, assuming the role of chairman with full control.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alvin was appointed as CEO.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Silas, upon hearing the news, felt his heart drop. Blood sprayed from his mouth in a violent gush.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He refused to accept it. Silver Shield Security had been the pride of the Nicholson family, and now it was being stolen by outsiders.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Liars! Get out here, all of you!" Silas screamed, attempting to storm into the building, but was stopped by a group of security guards.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Stop! What do you think you're doing? You're no longer vice president. The chairman has ordered that no one from the Nicholson family is allowed inside."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The guards, showing no mercy, shoved Silas back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the past, when the Nicholson family had been at the peak of their power, they treated the guards like mere servants&mdash;calling on them as if they were nothing more than lapdogs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Now, however, those same guards had no respect left for them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You bastard! Let me in, or I'll fire you all... you damn dogs! You're nothing but dogs!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Get out!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The head of security shouted, shoving Silas harshly to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What... how dare you? You're just a security guard! How dare you lay a hand on me?" Silas stammered in disbelief, and his pride was shattered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ha! You think you're still vice president? Your family's done for. You're lower than a dog now, so get lost. If you don't, we'll throw you out ourselves."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The head of security's words were sharp, dripping with scorn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Silas, now livid, felt his blood boil. The humiliation was too much.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In his fury, everything went black, and he collapsed unconscious on the spot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Meanwhile, Alvin and Alexander entered the research and development lab.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everywhere they walked, employees of Silver Shield Security showed deep respect, bowing their heads and stepping aside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Silver Shield Security mainly manufactures and sells surveillance cameras, alarm systems, night-vision equipment, protective helmets, tactical gear, bulletproof vests, long-range communication devices, and stun guns," Alvin proudly explained as he led Alexander through the lab. "All of our products have passed military-grade tests. Our clients range from the military to civilian sectors, and our quality is unmatched."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander's heart leaped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This was exactly the kind of acquisition he had been looking for.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Earlier, he had stockpiled weapons, ammunition, and military-grade equipment worth hundreds of billions of dollars on Treasure Island and Devil Island.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, without the ability to maintain and produce more, it was a hollow investment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He needed the production capacity to sustain his strength in the long term, especially if the world was heading toward disaster.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander's eyes gleamed as he turned to Alvin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'd like to see a sample of your All-purpose Bullet-resistant Jacket. I might have a few suggestions for improvements."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alvin paused, taken aback. Was this mysterious Alexander not only skilled in combat and medicine, but also an expert in developing security products?</span></p><div class="pagination">
