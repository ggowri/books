  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite the Vance family's power, </span><span>Loscity</span><span> was still under the control of the Ultimate Alliance. While she recognized the Vance family's strength, Ava couldn't help but think that it wouldn't be so easy for them to overpower Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We should still be cautious," Ava said. "The Vance family is influential in </span><span>Kingsdon</span><span>."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's gaze hardened for a moment, his voice cool and confident.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If we're strong enough, who cares about the Vance family? I'll crush anyone who stands in my way."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words carried the weight of someone who had already decided their fate, and Ava felt a surge of reassurance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm holding a big memorial for my mother the day after tomorrow," Alexander said, turning to Lily. "If any of the relatives want to join, they're welcome."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now that he was successful, Alexander had no problem helping any relatives who were worth his time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily nodded </span><span>eagerly,</span><span> her voice filled with determination. "Right, the more people, the better. We'll make sure to protect your mother's grave."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry, Lily."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They stood for a moment by the grave before leaving the cemetery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the car, Alexander gave Augusta strict orders to keep the cemetery under constant guard, ensuring Ryder wouldn't try anything else.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Back at the villa, Alexander and Ava got to work, planning how to handle the Vance family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, Alexander's phone buzzed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He glanced at it and smiled knowingly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's General Thompson. He wants me to negotiate with the Vance family and avoid conflict. Apparently, the old man, Axel, from the Vance family is a senior member of the Ghost.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Ghost is behind the recent chaos on Treasure Island, and Axel is one of the masterminds."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava frowned, her worry clear. "Ryder must have already reported to the Vance family. </span><span>Are we really going to face off with them the day after tomorrow?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander </span><span>chuckled,</span><span> his voice laced with confidence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>So</span><span> what if he's in the Ghost? I know people who are just as powerful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll get Gavin to pull some strings, bring in the real power players. We'll sweeten the deal, and the Vance family won't know what hit them."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava paused, then smiled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Gavin's practically second only to the president in </span><span>Avalora</span><span>. One word from him and the Vance family would be nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But are you sure he would go that far for us? Offending the Vance family isn't a small risk."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was unshaken.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry. I'm the only one who can heal his injuries. Without me, he's finished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And I've already told Augusta to keep the grave protected. No one's touching it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava sighed with relief. With </span><span>Loscity</span><span> in their corner and Gavin and other top-tier allies on their side, the Vance family wouldn't stand a chance even if they brought everything they had.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, I'll head to the office and get everything set up. We're going to make sure the Vance family regrets this," she said, leaning over to kiss him quickly before rushing out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, in a luxury hotel suite, Ryder stood stiffly, his face pale as he faced the young man sitting with a cold expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Vance... I'm sorry, I... I didn't complete your order," Ryder stammered, his voice trembling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Asher snorted derisively before kicking Ryder to the floor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Useless. Get out of my sight!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ryder scrambled away, breathing a sigh of relief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Asher picked up his phone and dialed the head of the </span><span>Loscity</span><span> police, Oliver.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Oliver had been lounging in his office when the phone rang. The sight of Asher's name on the screen made him spring to his feet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, Asher was from the Vance family, the top-tier power in </span><span>Kingsdon</span><span>. Even the governor had to give him face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Vance, how can I assist you?" Oliver said, his voice dripping with respect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I need a favor from you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What kind of favor, Mr. Vance?" Oliver asked eagerly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Vance family's favor could be the key to his rise in the ranks. He couldn't afford to pass this opportunity up.</span></p><div class="pagination">
