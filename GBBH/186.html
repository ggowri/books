  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't rush it, guys. Here, let's have a drink first," Alexander said with a grin, raising his glass.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The three clinked their glasses together and downed their drinks in one go.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they sipped and chatted, the hours crept closer to midnight, yet there was still no sign of Ian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just when Alexander was beginning to think Ian wouldn't show, an excited voice crackled in his earpiece.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Boss, Ian's here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instantly alert, Alexander turned his gaze toward the entrance of the bar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The door swung open, and a group of people surged in, surrounding a balding middle-aged man&mdash;none other than Ian himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dressed in a gray suit and adorned with a chunky gold chain and a flashy watch, Ian strutted in, his arm draped around a stunning woman in revealing attire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ten of his henchmen flanked him, their watchful eyes scanning the crowd for any </span><span>threats.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ian's sharp gaze darted around, and after a quick sweep of the bar, he relaxed slightly, a smile creeping onto his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He playfully groped the woman, and together, they sauntered down the corridor that led to the back office.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Boss, you were right! Ian really showed up," Augusta said, his impatience palpable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marvin was practically itching to spring into action. If it weren't for Alexander holding him back, he would have charged in already.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those lackeys didn't stand a chance against him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Alexander's attention was fixed on the woman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A frown creased his brow as he recognized her. He mused, "That's Lillian Fairfax, Jane's cousin. Not exactly a good girl; she's in the nightlife scene at this age? I can't believe she's mixed up with Ian."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Boss, can we make our move now?" Augusta asked, his excitement bubbling over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Not just yet. We've got them hooked; there's no way they'll slip away. Let's wait until they're all inside," Alexander replied with a cold smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He watched Ian and Lillian disappear into the corridor, followed closely by Ian's thugs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander remained calm, biding his time for a few more minutes to ensure no more of Ian's men were entering.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, he exchanged glances with Augusta and Marvin, giving them the signal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a shared thrill, they sprang to their feet and made their way toward the back of the bar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they approached the corridor, two burly bouncers blocked their path.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One of them, a bald man with a fierce glare, barked, "Are you blind? No loitering allowed here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tell Ian someone's here to settle a score," Alexander replied, his tone steady and unfazed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The bald man hesitated, sizing Alexander up. His right hand instinctively moved toward the gun hidden at his waist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander caught the movement and couldn't help but smirk.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a flash, Augusta and Marvin lunged forward, each grabbing a bouncer by the neck and twisting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a sickening crack, both men collapsed, their bodies discarded into the stairwell.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is what they call </span><span>Loscity's</span><span> fourth largest gang? They think their lair is a lion's den, but really, they're just trash." Alexander scoffed, stepping past the fallen bodies with confidence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Augusta and Marvin quickly fell in line behind him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the end of the corridor was a lavish private room that looked like an office but held more secrets within.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The interior was as opulent as a five-star hotel, decked out with expensive carpets and handcrafted wooden furniture.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ian lounged on a plush </span><span>sofa,</span><span> Lillian nestled against him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her ample boobs were barely contained by her outfit, her short skirt revealing long, </span><span>flawless legs&mdash;half of her backside was visible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ian slid his hand beneath Lillian's skirt, eliciting a burst of giggles from her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Standing nearby were Ian's henchmen, their expressions stone-cold, as if they didn't care about the debauchery unfolding before them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These were the elite of the Fraternity; Ian wouldn't be so relaxed if they weren't.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lillian leaned in close, whispering something in Ian's ear that made him laugh heartily, completely unaware of the storm brewing just outside his door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a resounding crash, the door burst open, and in strode Alexander and his two companions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ian's initial shock quickly subsided when he saw it was just the three of them. He remained unfazed, even keeping his hand inside Lillian's skirt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're Alexander, huh? What do you want with me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ian recognized him and immediately adopted an air of smug superiority.</span></p><div class="pagination">
