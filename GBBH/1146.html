  <div class="container"><p style="text-align:left;">At that moment, the portly Travis Stark chimed in, &quot;Mr. Chapman probably just wants to play it safe. After all, Stephen is known as the top fighter in Sakra Society. But no matter his strength, I could take him down easily.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">As he spoke, he snapped his fingers, conjuring a small flame that danced between them.</p><p style="text-align:left;">The Flame power shifted as Cesar and Dariel&#x27;s expressions grew serious.</p><p style="text-align:left;">A metahuman wielding level-three Flame power was indeed awesome, compounded by Travis&#x27; credentials as a wrestling champion.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Seeing their serious faces only inflated Travis&#x27; ego, and a grin spread across his chubby cheeks.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Alexander replied coolly, &quot;You&#x27;re quite arrogant for someone with only level-three fire power. I wonder what someone with level-nine power would be.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Travis erupted in fury, slamming the table as he prepared to confront Alexander.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Karson stepped in quickly, soothing them. &quot;You&#x27;re all my guests, so let&#x27;s keep the peace for my sake. Despite his age, Alex is incredibly skilled. I have to admit he might even be better than me.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;So, with Alex joining us, I&#x27;m sure we can defeat Stephen.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">The room fell silent as Cesar, Travis, and Dariel exchanged looks, clearly doubting Karson&#x27;s words and blaming Alexander&#x27;s youth for his bravado.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Karson cleared his throat and began to introduce the three men to Alexander.</p><p style="text-align:left;">He gestured to Cesar, saying, &quot;This is Mr. Cesar Dussel, a martial arts expert of the highest caliber.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Then, he pointed at Dariel, &quot;This is Mr. Dariel Garvey. He&#x27;s not only gifted with supernatural power but is also a champion boxer, having knocked out opponents 30 times in a row.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;And this is Mr. Travis Stark,&quot; Karson continued. &quot;He&#x27;s a three-time gold medalist in wrestling and holds level-three fire power. Truly unbeatable!&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">All three were indeed impressive, and it was rare to encounter such strength in one place. Karson clearly put a lot of effort into gathering them here.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Karson then smiled, gesturing towards Alexander. &quot;Alex is a bit unassuming, but I want to introduce him properly to avoid any misunderstandings.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;This is Mr. Alexander Hawthorne from Loscity, the creator of the magic powder.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">The trio was visibly taken aback, their gazes fixed on Alexander.</p><p style="text-align:left;">They were well aware of the magic powder and had heard of Alexander&#x27;s accomplishments, yet they were shocked to see someone so young associated with it.</p><p style="text-align:left;">The experts fell silent. While they weren&#x27;t overly enthusiastic about Alexander, their attitude shifted to a more respectful stance compared to their earlier demeanor.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Alexander maintained his composure. &quot;Mr. Chapman, you&#x27;re too kind. There&#x27;s no need for such introductions. I&#x27;m confident they won&#x27;t be able to deal with Stephen.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">The words ignited a fire within the three experts.</p><p style="text-align:left;">As a martial artist respected wherever Cesar went, he&#x27;d never encountered a youth as audacious as Alexander.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Mr. Hawthorne, what makes you think we can&#x27;t handle Stephen?&quot; Cesar scoffed, his hand slamming down on the table in front of Alexander.</p><p style="text-align:left;">In an instant, his palm sank deep into the wood like a branding iron, creating a clear imprint as he withdrew his hand, leaving a gaping hole behind.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Cesar&#x27;s move shocked everyone except Alexander.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Mr. Chapman, it&#x27;s not that I want to be kind, but he is too full of himself.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Who does he think we can&#x27;t deal with Stephen? If it weren&#x27;t for your sake, I would have already knocked some sense into him!&quot; Cesar growled, his eyes glaring daggers at Alexander, filled with intent to harm.</p><p style="text-align:left;">While Karson was a skilled fighter, he couldn&#x27;t help but be impressed by Cesar&#x27;s power.</p><p style="text-align:left;">The clean cut of the palm print was not only piercing but also smooth, as if someone had polished it meticulously.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Impressive, Cesar! I have no doubt you could take down Stephen on your own,&quot; Karson said confidently.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Cesar puffed up with pride while Dariel rolled his eyes, and Travis also appeared unimpressed.</p><div class="pagination">
