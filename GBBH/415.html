  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Augusta had already taken action, hitting the bald guy and the skinny guy with his huge fists behind their heads, respectively.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a thud, the two men fell silently to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>William was even more decisive as he pulled out his silenced pistol and fired two shots.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was supposed to be a gunman. After his power improved, the speed of his gun was comparable to that of a super cowboy in the movie, and his bullets never missed their targets.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The remaining two were immediately shot in the shoulder, covering their shoulders and about to scream, but they were pinched by Augusta's neck and fainted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The four guys who had been so cheerful just a few moments before all fell to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Augusta hurriedly tied them up and dragged them to the secluded woods to torture them severely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To stay alive, they had to transfer all the money in their accounts to Augusta, which added up to over a million dollars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Augusta hadn't been on Treasure Island long, but he had already made almost ten million dollars by doing this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After the transfer, Augusta searched the four men and found four bottles of Level 2 power elixir, and of course, it was diluted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sir, spare our lives! We've already done what you asked, so shouldn't you let us go?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The bald man kept pleading.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The other three looked at Augusta expectantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Augusta sneered, walked over to them calmly, and tied them together with a rope.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What do you want? Sir, you swore you'd let us go..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The bald man was anxious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Augusta said expressionlessly, "I didn't say I wouldn't let you go, but I didn't tell you what I would do."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The four heard the first half of the sentence with a sudden burst of relief, but the second half made them feel like they had fallen into hell.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let them go! It's up to them whether will survive or not."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Augusta waved her hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A few henchmen yanked the four men, who were bundled up into a ball, and threw them straight over the cliff into the sea.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>William watched it all with a grin on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We didn't break our promise, and it's up to their destiny whether they live or not."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ha-ha-ha!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Augusta smiled and patted William on the shoulder. Then, he gave him two bottles of Level 2 power elixir.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two excitedly poured it all into their mouths and sat cross-legged as Alexander had taught them to meditate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander taught them Warrior's way of meditating on a whim, and he wondered if it would work on ordinary people.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a period of experimentation, both Augusta and William found it useful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They boosted their strength faster, and even if they took more Level 2 power elixir, there were no so-called side effects.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Of course, it would be almost impossible for them to cultivate the Force and become a Warrior if they tried to rely on this meditation method.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After just over ten minutes, Augusta suddenly opened his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes in the darkness were filled with amazement as he felt that his physical qualities had improved a lot more. Although no mutant abilities had appeared, his power had increased again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Augusta took hundreds of thousands of dollars out of the money he had just grabbed and distributed it to his men.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone was excited and looking forward to the next action at once.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come on. Let's continue!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two led a patrol around the Red Umbrella Group as they kept robbing and killing their enemies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The people missing from the Red Umbrella Group were increasing in number, and they could never find the enemy, so they had to blame it all on poor security.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They organized a security team in the manner of the Brilliant Group and started patrolling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But it was ineffective, and instead, several patrols went missing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Augusta and William became increasingly powerful through their battles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Red Umbrella Group had set up traps twice, and hundreds of people surrounded them or were killed by the two of them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the contrary, the Red Umbrella Group lost dozens of people, and they were furious at once.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Treasure Island was an important location for the Red Umbrella Group, and they were researching power elixir on the island, so they couldn't afford to lose it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But as the balance of power tipped, the Red Umbrella Group was at a disadvantage on the island.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With each passing day, Augusta and William were stronger than the day before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They walked like real ghosts on Treasure Island, capturing and killing the people of the Red Umbrella Group and taking their deposits and power elixir.</span></p><div class="pagination">
