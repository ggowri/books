Then they charged at Alexander, howling like wild animals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What followed was a symphony of screams and splashes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One by one, Alexander backhanded them into the pool like they were nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ouch! How dare you attack me? I'll call the </span><span>guy</span><span>s of the Ultimate Alliance over right away. You are doomed..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Waylon struggled to climb out of the water, trying to threaten Alexander fiercely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before he could finish his words, Alexander stepped on his hand and crushed it hard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Poor Waylon shrieked and plopped into the pool again, his right hand disabled.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After gulping down a bellyful of water, he was finally pulled out by his lackeys.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Alexander had already left with Lynn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Waylon roared awkwardly, "I will teach them a lesson and destroy them... I must take revenge on them!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Indeed, revenge is a must!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You must not let that shameless couple off."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The lackeys nodded repeatedly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Back at home, Alexander and Lynn found Ava reclining on the sofa and watching TV instead of falling asleep.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey! Why are you back so soon?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava</span><span> was a bit surprised</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Notic</span><span>ing that Alexander and Lynn were not very high-spirited, she wondered if they had a fight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, Lynn angrily recounted their encounter with Waylon just now. She had planned to spend some time alone with Alexander, but unexpectedly, they ran into such an annoying killjoy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So that's the case. I thought you had a fight," Ava smiled, feeling relieved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If there was a conflict between Lynn and Alexander, she would be in a dilemma.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's eyes fell on Ava, who was dressed in a long silky white nightgown. From the slit neckline, he saw the deep cleavage created by her huge breasts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her tender, well-proportioned, and </span><span>smooth</span><span> legs were revealed from the open hem.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was elegant and graceful, exuding an incomparable sexy aura.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feeling</span><span> Alexander's gaze, she chuckled charmingly and stretched out her foot to rub his calf.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Take it easy. Don't be angry. You're already home..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lynn and Ava sat on either side of Alexander. He hugged them and immediately smelt their alluring fragrance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't help but take a deep breath, feeling very satisfied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Naturally, he placed his hands on each of their breasts, kneading and admiring them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their breasts were so big that his hands couldn't cover them. His five fingers on each hand were deeply embedded in their soft, bouncy breasts. It felt so wonderful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lynn and Ava blushed scarlet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come on. </span><span>Let</span><span>'</span><span>s go</span><span> upstairs."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander wrapped his arms on their waists, picked up the pretty mother and daughter, and rushed towards the bedroom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While kissing, they entered the bathroom. Lynn and Ava both clung to him, enjoying the water falling over them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He lifted Lynn and placed her on his thighs. With his right arm around her slender waist, he stroked her buttocks with his left hand and kissed her neck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She groaned softly, her delicate face flushing extremely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was still unaccustomed to having sex with Alexander in front of Ava.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Smiling sweetly, Ava turned her upper body around, embraced him, and kissed him on the face, neck, and back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He enjoyed the kiss with Lynn while admiring her sexy and attractive figure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though already middle-aged, she was plump and well-proportioned with an amazing touch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her attractive breasts were still full and elastic, perfectly hemispherical, not at all like those of women whose breasts sagged and deformed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander asked Lynn to pivot around and face him with her back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, he held her soft buttocks and watched with his own eyes how his penis entered her wet, seductive vagina.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lynn raised her head and screamed. She threw back her arms and seized Alexander's legs, shaking violently.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And </span><span>Ava kept running her hands over his body and caressing him...</span></p><div class="pagination">
