  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mary nodded thoughtfully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"According to our intel, Alexander is on the hunt for some top-tier gems. The Kaylon auction is just around the corner. We'll catch him off guard."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Houtte</span><span> couldn't help but </span><span>stare at</span><span> Mary's ample boobs, grinning </span><span>with desire</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's do it then. I'm dying to see if Alexander really has any skills!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mary shot him a warning glare. "Keep your eyes to yourself, or I'll have them popped out!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, she turned on her heel and got into her car, eager to put distance between herself and such a sleazy man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Moore, are we really going to partner with the Cripples?" her young, attractive assistant asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mary narrowed her eyes, contemplating her next move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Find out </span><span>where </span><span>Alexander</span><span> is </span><span>and bring him back to me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The assistant blinked in surprise but quickly nodded in agreement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, </span><span>Alice</span><span> stood by the grand floor-to-ceiling window, watching as </span><span>Houtte</span><span> and Mary went their separate ways.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She scoffed, "You think you can </span><span>have</span><span> the magic powder formula? Dream on."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alice</span><span> selected a villa and sent the details over to Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[This is part of the Saint Group's </span><span>properties</span><span>, located in one of </span><span>Loscity's</span><span> finest neighborhoods&mdash;on par with Beverly Hills. By the way, it seems the Cripples and the Blood Gang are making some moves.]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Alexander received </span><span>Alice</span><span>'s message, he frowned slightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hadn't expected the Cripples and the Blood Gang to be so greedy. </span><span>He</span><span> had barely started partnership</span><span> </span><span>with</span><span> them</span><span>, and already they were itching to get their hands on the formula.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Money truly was the root of all evil; it turned people into demons.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The magic powder generated profits of hundreds of millions globally each year.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander realized he had been naive. In the face of such enormous </span><span>profits</span><span>, normal people might turn on their own </span><span>families</span><span>, let alone gangs like the Cripples and the Blood Gang.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His old Toyota was totaled, so he hailed a cab to check out the villa </span><span>Alice</span><span> had mentioned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He planned to bring Lily over once Ashley was discharged. Living together would make things livelier, and Ashley wouldn't feel so lonely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grand Hyatt Estates was one of the five wealthiest districts in </span><span>Loscity</span><span>. Nestled by the sea, it boasted stunning views and top-notch security.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unless one was a resident or had permission, outsiders couldn't </span><span>get</span><span> in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Lily and Ashley living there, plus Augusta and their crew providing </span><span>secret</span><span> protection, safety wouldn't be an issue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the taxi pulled up to the entrance of Grand Hyatt Estates, Alexander stepped out, only to be nearly blindsided by a roaring blue Ferrari that sped past him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It slammed to a halt in front of the security booth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A few guards immediately perked up, grinning as they recognized the vehicle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Ulysses, welcome back!" they called out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inside the car was a young man in his twenties with a stunning woman in the passenger seat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The woman was striking, her makeup bold and alluring, wearing a tight black crop top that accentuated her bosom and tiny denim shorts that showcased her long, flawless </span><span>legs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander squinted, realizing the driver was Xavier Ulysses, a former high school classmate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Xavier had come from a wealthy family and had a reputation for bullying others&mdash;Alexander had been one of his targets.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Xavier held the steering wheel with one hand while the other rested casually on the woman's thigh, looking at the guards with an air of superiority.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What are you guys doing standing around? Do you not see some shady character lurking about? Get your act together!" he sneered, casting a disdainful glance at Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The head of security immediately turned to Alexander, barking, "Who do you think you are?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This isn't a place for just anyone to gawk at. Get lost!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Xavier was the son of the renowned gem dealer Julia Ulysses, which explained why he could afford a villa in Grand Hyatt Estates.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Xavier filed any complaints, the security team could </span><span>lose their</span><span> job.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's expression remained icy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is this how you treat a resident?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The head of security hesitated for a moment, then quickly backtracked. "Mr. Ulysses, please don't take this the wrong way. This guy claims he's a resident here, and we need to verify."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Pfft! Like he could ever be a resident here!" Xavier scoffed</span><span> with</span><span> a smirk</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He turned to Alexander, his voice dripping with mockery. "Oh, Alexander, you really think I wouldn't recognize you? I heard you're out of a job now, and that your wife got snatched away&mdash;true or not?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His laughter echoed with cruel delight.</span><span> </span><span>Xavier slammed the gas pedal, </span><span>starting</span><span> the engine as he sped into the community, leaving behind a cloud of noxious exhaust that hung in the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander stood there, </span><span>coldly </span><span>watching the Ferrari disappear down the road. He felt a simmering anger rise within him. Today's humiliation wouldn't be forgotten.</span><span> </span><span>Xavier would pay for this.</span></p><div class="pagination">
