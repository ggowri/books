  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking outside through the iron gate, there were prison cells everywhere, all with black iron bars, so densely packed together, that it was like a prison.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were also fully armed patrol guards at the end of the corridor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lynne saw many cells filled with women or men like her, all with expressionless faces, like zombies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone was as weak as she was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lynne suddenly saw a familiar-looking woman in the cell opposite. She was Lynne's former colleague who also worked as a shopping guide before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She later saved enough money, left Treasure Island, and went home.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lynne once fantasized about being able to earn enough money and go home to live a normal life like her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't expect she was locked up here!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The woman also saw Lynne and a gleam of light flashed in her eyes immediately, then dimmed in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I also wanted to go home before, but I was taken to hell by the devil. Everything is over, you can never go back..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She sang the ballad crazily. The tune was weird and scary, and Lynne was frightened out of her wits.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was a legend on the island that once you got to Treasure Island, you should never think about leaving, otherwise you would live a life worse than death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thought that she might never be able to leave here again made her feel cold all over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She's new here and very beautiful. Take her to see the warden right away."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A bald man in black clothes called Peter appeared at the door of the cell, followed by several strong men.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They all opened their eyes wide and stared greedily at Lynne's plump body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lynne was so frightened that she even forgot to cover herself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, Lynne was handcuffed and dragged out of the cell.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Peter grabbed her chin and threatened grimly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You should have understood your fate. I hope you can be sensible and serve the warden well. Anyone who dares to disobey will be stripped naked and thrown into the sea to feed the sharks!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you understand?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The terrifying threats and the saliva flying everywhere frightened Lynne so much that her face turned pale and her whole body trembled uncontrollably.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Very good, you are a smart woman. You will have to serve us like a dog from now on."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Peter became excited.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No! I'm not a dog, I'm a human. Please, I want to see Mr. Milton, I won't leave Treasure Island, I won't go back..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lynne cried and screamed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now that you're here, do you still want to go back?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone burst into laughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Take her away!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Peter waved his hand indifferently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lynne was grabbed by two big men and dragged away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She struggled desperately, naked, and one could easily imagine how charming she was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, the terrifying singing was still coming from the cell opposite.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I also wanted to go home before, but I was taken to hell by the devil. Everything is over, you can never go back..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Alexander walked out of the trading center, he did not go to the hotel opposite immediately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He walked around the area and still felt someone staring at him in the dark.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was obvious that either John was monitoring him, or there was someone else.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>John and Robert had both shown a certain degree of trust in him just now, so it was unlikely to be them, it could only be someone else.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Who could it be?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Could it be someone from the Red Umbrella Group?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander remained calm, pretending not to notice anything, and walked into the hotel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne, you finally contacted me. Are you safe?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alice finally received Alexander's satellite video call and immediately breathed a sigh of relief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Most of the day had passed and she had been on the yacht, feeling extremely tormented.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing that Alexander was unharmed, Alice patted her chest excitedly. Her plump breasts moved seductively, making Alexander swallow hard a few times involuntarily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alice also noticed Alexander's actions, so she proudly raised her chest and threw a wink at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's going well for now. I bought a batch of meteorites on the island and they will be shipped to </span><span>Loscity</span><span> soon. Find someone to receive them. Don't expose my identity."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander ordered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay, please rest assured, leave everything to me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When it came to business, Alice also became serious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander did not mention the potential potion, not because he did not trust Alice, but because the fewer people who knew about it for the time being, the better.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After chatting with Alice for a few words, Alexander hung up the video.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't wait to study the potential potion.</span></p><div class="pagination">
