  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, Simon felt a sharp pain in his abdomen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He slowly lowered his head and watched as Logan pounded a fist into his stomach, followed by a second one.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Simon screamed miserably and fell to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Logan, what do you mean?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Simon's eyes widened in anger, and he tried to bite Logan severely a few times, but all his strength was taken away by the two punches.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Logan looked serious and said coldly, "Simon, you've provoked someone you shouldn't have."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You! He..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Simon looked over at Alexander, his eyes filled with horror.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander waved his hand. "Take him back for interrogation, and I want to know why he did it today."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, Mr. Hawthorne!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Logan responded loudly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was a deafening silence. A moment ago, they had been good friends, and Jane had even </span><span>thought</span><span> Logan would surely help Simon out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't expect the situation to reverse in an instant at all, and Simon was tied up and taken away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander looked at Jane indifferently and warned, "I hope you behave yourself. If you do it again, don't blame me for being rude!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that said, Alexander left with holding Ashley in his right hand and Ava in his left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane glared at Alexander, gritting her teeth as if she were a witch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they returned home, Ava still looked worried.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is definitely not that simple. There is a conspiracy in the Red Umbrella Group."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander nodded approvingly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry. Now that Simon is in our hands, he will confess honestly soon."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ashley was exhausted from suffering for so long and slept well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava suddenly stumbled and fell into Alexander's arms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander thought Ava wanted to hug him, but he didn't realize Ava was burning up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You have a fever!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He exclaimed as Ava's delicate face </span><span>was flushed,</span><span> her eyes slightly closed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander touched Ava's forehead again and confirmed that she had a high fever.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava was soaking wet from playing in the water for half a day. Also, she had gone through a scare, so she had caught a cold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Silly girl, you had such a bad fever, but you didn't tell me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lie down first, and I'll help bring down your fever."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander helped Ava gently lie down on the bed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava agreed in a daze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her voice was like the faint purr of a kitten, incredibly charming.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her bright and large eyes were even more flattering because she was weak and feeble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why didn't you tell me earlier if you weren't feeling well? Are you being silly?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander healed her while caring for her and casting the Force with his hands. He massaged Ava's body as a steady stream of the Force penetrated into her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmm..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava shivered all over as her sensitive parts were cupped by Alexander's big hands and kneaded with special skills.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, Ava couldn't help but feel a wave of warmth coursing through her entire body as if she had been electrocuted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I thought I'd be fine after a while, but I didn't expect a fever..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava was a bit embarrassed, and she looked pitiful and aggrieved, making Alexander throb.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wrapped her arms around Alexander's waist, and it was getting tighter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had a perfect body that Alexander could touch and taste as much as he wanted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander immediately had his normal reaction, but he took a deep breath and suppressed his desire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava was already this sick, and she needed to rest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't move around. When I'm done healing you, your fever will be gone after sleeping properly."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander kept touching Ava's body with his big hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava moaned continuously from the stimulation, her perfect body making Alexander so desperate for more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was simply a mesmerizing siren!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The most primal desires surged up in Alexander's heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava wrapped her arms around Alexander and kissed him, and she bit his lips a few times.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her lips were sensual, smooth, and soft with a hint of sweetness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander felt a soft and hot body snuggle up to his as if he had traveled to the hot equator, where the temperature was rising...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ava, no. You need to rest!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava blushed as she was moved to tears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Good girl, you should get some rest. We'll do it when you're better."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smiled and quietly left the room after kneading her delicate breasts a few times.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He made his way to the study, having things on his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What was the Red Umbrella Group up to?</span></p><div class="pagination">
