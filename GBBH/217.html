  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander quickly agreed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry. I will help you even if you don't tell me. I will let your mother become the head of the Ulysses family."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Xavier was confused.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had never thought that Alexander had such great ability. They had just been expelled and was about to lose Phoenix Gemstone Establishment. He begged Alexander in anxiety.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said, "Alexander, Aiden has the support of the Kaylon. Can we defeat them?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Xavier reminded Alexander cautiously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smiled, "Leave everything to me. When your mother becomes the head of the Ulysses family, I will ask her to help me collect some gems."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Xavier assured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, no matter when, as long as you need us, we will do our best."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander patted Xavier's shoulder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay, tell your mother that she can prepare to become the head of the Ulysses family and take over the Ulysses family's assets."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Xavier said, "Alexander, are you... Are you serious?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Xavier widened his eyes, still unable to believe it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander said, "I always keep my word and always do what I say."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you, Alexander!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Xavier became excited but still skeptical.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander returned to the villa. Charlize saw that he looked unhappy, so she quickly made a cup of coffee and brought it to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What happened?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander sighed and smiled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I never thought that there would be such shameless people in the world besides the </span><span>Fairfax family. Aiden and Angelica opened my eyes."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aiden? Is he the one who started out as a </span><span>jewellery</span><span> maker?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Charlize asked curiously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander exclaimed, "Do you know him?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Charlize nodded. "Yes. I was his bodyguard once before. He tried to tease me, but I beat him up."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander couldn't help laughing and looked at Charlize's sexy body with admiration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was wearing a short leather skirt today, revealing a large area of breasts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Below her waist was a round butt. Her beautiful legs wearing crystal black stockings were very attractive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Charlize sensed Alexander's gaze and turned around shyly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"m I sexy?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander couldn't help but blush and felt a little embarrassed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander had known that Charlize was interested in him, but he would never take the initiative when he had a girlfriend.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, Charlize turned and closed the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why did you close the door?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander couldn't help but get nervous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Charlize did not answer, but naturally took off her leather skirt, revealing a large area of her body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were only two small flesh-colored breast stickers on her breasts, which trembled with her movements.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was wearing tight black panties made of sheer silk mesh, which excited Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Charlize, what are you doing? Get dressed. I'm warning you. If you dare to mess around again, I won't want you to be my subordinate anymore!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander shouted loudly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Charlize froze, obviously frightened by Alexander's words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the next second, she threw Alexander onto the sofa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, he held the soft and fragrant beauty in his arms. The soft and elastic body made Alexander unable to control his reaction as a man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Charlize felt something hard pressing against her. She giggled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>So</span><span> you wanted it too. Don't be embarrassed. I volunteered. There are too few men like you. I just like you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She stared at Alexander with seductive eyes, then touched Alexander's pants.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was helpless and thought he had done nothing wrong.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Charlize had a very good figure and appearance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because of regular exercise, her body was elastic and flexible. Some difficult moves were easy for her, which was good for men.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Charlize had made herself naked, revealing her delicate skin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She knelt in front of Alexander. And her buttocks becoming even sexier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why don't you move..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Charlize turned her head and looked at Alexander.</span></p><div class="pagination">
