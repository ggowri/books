  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the rooftop was empty, except for the four of them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Noah's face was covered in sweat, and he forced a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Johnny, don't scare me. We're still a few hundred meters away. How could he spot us? It's not like he's got eagle eyes..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adrian, standing beside him, wore a serious expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't scare yourself. I think he noticed something else and stopped to check. Maybe it's the uneven terrain and the bushes blocking our view."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Johnny kept his gun up, eyes wide open, scanning the surroundings intently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, an intense sense of danger kept growing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Noah snapped out of it too, tossing his sniper rifle aside and grabbing a submachine gun.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Johnny, there are four of us together. Even if Alexander tries something, we have nothing to fear. I'm more worried he won't show up!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes gleamed with both murderous intent and greed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The General hasn't given the order yet, but if we catch Alexander early, we're sure to get promoted."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adrian nodded repeatedly. "Right, let's take the initiative and grab Alexander's people."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were the elite team, well-equipped, and carrying out an ambush. Taking down Alexander was not a concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Johnny remained silent, cold sweat breaking out on his forehead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shut up! We've been targeted for a while now..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What!?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The group immediately felt chills, cold sweat covering their backs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, two small red dots appeared on Johnny's and Noah's chests.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn! Snipers!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were shocked, but none dared to move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Whoever managed to lock onto them silently, right under their noses, had to be as skilled as them, if not better.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On a nearby building, William and Charlize both sneered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If those two fools made even the slightest move, they wouldn't hesitate to shoot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, Johnny sensed a shadow flash behind him and turned immediately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's you! How did you get up here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He glared at Alexander, who had appeared like a ghost, his face turning grim.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All four stared wide-eyed, unable to believe Alexander had appeared silently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Alexander had opened fire a moment earlier, they'd all be dead by now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you Schroder's people? Trying to kill me or capture me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's tone was as cold as ice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Johnny was flustered, momentarily unsure how to respond, just staring at Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander, with his hands behind his back, smiled casually.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Schroder invited me to the banquet just to steal my magic powder formula. If I don't agree, you'll make your move, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Johnny suddenly shouted, cutting off Alexander's words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As expected of an elite team Johnny, he pretended to be intimidated by Alexander but had been planning an ambush all along.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He rolled quickly to dodge the sniper's aim, using Alexander's body as cover, and pulled the trigger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bang! Bang! Bang!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Three bullets shot straight toward Alexander's chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His movements were fast enough that Charlize, who had been targeting him, couldn't get a clear shot. He used Alexander to block her line of sight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn bastard!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Charlize cursed viciously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, William and Noah fired almost simultaneously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Noah also rolled, unleashing a hail of bullets from his submachine gun at Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But his thigh was hit by William, leaving a bowl-sized wound with blood gushing out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ignoring the wound, Noah emptied his magazine in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dozens of bullets covered Alexander's entire body, leaving him nowhere to hide!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The bullets rained down on Alexander at such close range that no one thought he could survive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Johnny's face twisted into a grim yet pleased smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adrian and another teammate didn't idle either; both drew their combat knives simultaneously, charging at Alexander at full speed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Getting close to Alexander was the only way to force the hidden snipers to hold fire, afraid of hitting their own.</span></p><div class="pagination">
