Get out of here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Everyone, get out of the way. Do you know who this is? This is Mr. Lauren. Do you know the Lauren family? That's a family you can never offend."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man in black drove the hotel staff out, cursing them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A young man wearing a designer suit walked in with a swagger, surrounded by a group of big men in black.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He held his head high, looking superior, and glanced at everyone with contempt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hoson's</span><span> men clashed with these men in black, but they were outnumbered and were roughly pushed aside, and some were even knocked to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who the hell is this guy? He's so arrogant that he even dares to hit Mr. Farrow's men!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Farrow didn't respond. It seems like these people are hard to offend."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shut up! Keep your voice down. Don't you want to live?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Someone nearby covered his colleague's mouth to stop him from talking nonsense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's Kris, the son of Johnathan from the Lauren family. The Lauren family is much more powerful than Mr. Farrow, and even more ruthless. If you dare to gossip about him again, you will bear the consequences!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, everyone in the hotel trembled and hid aside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone looked at Kris with fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the past few years, Johnathan, the fastest-rising and most successful boss in </span><span>Kingsdon</span><span>, was the number one figure, and </span><span>Hoson</span><span> could only rank behind him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Johnathan was not only powerful but also ruthless and unafraid of the consequences.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Many industries in </span><span>Kingsdon</span><span> had been swallowed up by the Lauren family, and his network of relationships was very complicated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for why Johnathan and </span><span>Hoson</span><span> rose so quickly, legend had it that it was first the Brilliant Group that helped them, and later the Morris family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Considering Johnathan's strength, even </span><span>Hoson</span><span> didn't dare to confront him head-on, and no one dared to provoke him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kris suddenly went crazy, grabbed a bottle of wine and smashed it, then yelled while holding the half-broken bottle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Where is the envoy from the Brilliant Group? Get out here! I want to see who dares to command my family!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hoson</span><span> was about to call someone over but was stopped by Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm here, Kris, come over here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's voice was very calm, but it was heard very clearly by everyone, just like thunder echoing in their ears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hoson</span><span> was so frightened that his body trembled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Humph! You're smart."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kris snorted coldly and strode into the restaurant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dozens of his men followed behind him, like a group of ferocious hyenas, surrounding the place without any escape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kris waved the half-broken wine bottle with arrogance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Johnathan asked Kris to bring people to the hotel for investigation, but he arrogantly provoked others and did not take the envoy of the Brilliant Group seriously at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, a heavy and cold aura spread out, instantly making Kris' body stiffen, with cold sweat all over his back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Kris still didn't take it seriously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had long been accustomed to looking down on others, thinking that he was the eldest son of the Lauren family and no one dared to offend him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who is it? Get out here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kris strode forward, still shouting wildly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He turned a corner and saw Alexander and Brittany. </span><span>Hoson</span><span> was standing obediently beside them, staring at him grimly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kris looked at Alexander unceremoniously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was good-looking, but he was dressed very casually and looked no different from anyone else on the street.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kris suddenly became even more arrogant, and he raised his head involuntarily, his eyes full of contempt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you the messenger sent by the Brilliant Group? The Lauren family has already left the Brilliant Group. Who are you to summon us?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I am now warning you. Don't make self-righteous demands on the Lauren family anymore. The Lauren family is already wealthy in </span><span>Kingsdon</span><span> and will no longer obey orders blindly."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hoson</span><span> couldn't help laughing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is the Lauren family a wealthy family? Aren't you just a gangster like me? I think it's nothing."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kris was furious and pointed at </span><span>Hoson</span><span> and cursed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you say that again, I'll kill you!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
