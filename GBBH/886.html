Cyrus made no further sound.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Edmund swallowed hard, shocked at how quickly his brother had fallen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were masters of </span><span>ghostcraft</span><span>, capable of absorbing the souls left behind by the dead and converting them into their own strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This ability not only increased their power and speed but also significantly boosted their defense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even when Alexander's kukri dagger struck earlier, it hadn't breached their defenses. But Alexander was simply too strong.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Ahhh</span><span>!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Still stunned, Edmund suddenly felt searing pain in his arm.

He wore a black samurai uniform, with two katanas strapped diagonally across his back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His footsteps were so light they resembled a hunting lynx, silent and calculated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he hadn't revealed himself, Marvin and Shadow might never have noticed him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A ninja like this in a forest was lethal!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marvin and Shadow took deep breaths and tightened their grips on their weapons.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The forest was thick with an ominous sense of danger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Rumble!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thunder rumbled in the sky as dark clouds rolled in, signaling an impending storm.</span></p><div class="pagination">
