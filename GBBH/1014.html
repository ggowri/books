  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander chuckled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Asher, now are you scared? First, you brought my uncle in and caused trouble at the Brilliant Group. Then you attacked Ultimate Alliance's headquarters... Did you really think I would let you go so easily?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Betty rushed to Alexander's side and cautiously said, "Alexander, he's the Vance family's young master. Are you really going to kill him? Couldn't this cause some trouble?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander didn't reply to Betty. Instead, he turned back to Asher with playful smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You can't escape. Neither you nor Axel will get away. Once you're dead, your relatives will fight over the power. They'll even thank me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"So, do you really think the Vance family will avenge you two and come after me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Asher couldn't find his voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His face turned pale, and his hope shattered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander continued with calm but chilling voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You've repeatedly tried to steal my women. So you have to bear the consequences."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Asher trembled at his words, his body shaking as fear clawed at his insides.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"No! Please... I'm sorry, I swear I won't do it again. I made a mistake!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Asher's voice broke, his pleas coming out in panicked sobs, his mind unraveling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander smiled. "I know. Axel is still waiting for your reply at the hotel. I've already sent someone to find him. You'll have news soon."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Suddenly, Alexander's phone buzzed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Look! I told you there would be news."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He pulled out the phone, answered the video call, and held it in front of Asher.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The screen revealed an old face. It was Axel, bloodied and battered, gasping for air, lying on the floor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The moment Axel saw Asher's face on the screen, he cried out in relief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Asher! Help me! Save me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Asher's face went ashen. He was too far gone to help anyone now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Shut up!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A cold voice came from the phone. It was Augusta, his foot crushing Axel's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Axel screamed in agony, his cries of pain growing louder as he begged for mercy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Asher clutched his head, howling like a wild animal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Alright, I've given you two one last chance to see each other. Now, you can rest easily."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander smiled. Before Asher could beg again, Alexander kicked him straight in the groin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Asher let out a muffled scream.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Asher's mouth opened in shock, his eyes bulging as if he were a fish stranded on land, unable to make a sound.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The men nearby flinched, suddenly feeling a phantom ache in their groins.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Asher collapsed, motionless on the ground, blood pooling around him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander waved his hand dismissively. "Drag them out and bury them."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Once the haze of shock cleared, his men sprang into action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Some gathered the bodies, others cleaned up the bloodstains, and the remaining Vance family members were rounded up, handcuffed, and gagged with tape. They would be dealt with at the cemetery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander and Betty moved into the office.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Alexander, I missed you so much!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Betty suddenly threw herself into his arms, holding him tightly as though trying to merge with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander, feeling her soft and inviting curves pressing against him, couldn't help but feel a surge of desire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Betty's scent was intoxicating, and her feminine allure was irresistible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander wrapped his arms around her, his hands naturally landing on her full and soft hips, caressing them gently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Betty responded with a playful pout, wrapping herself around him like ivy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Without another word, they collapsed onto the couch... The office was filled with the sound of passionate moans and the crisp sound of bodies colliding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Only when the first light of dawn broke did Alexander leave the office, heading to his car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He glanced at his phone. Keith had sent him several messages, but he had been too busy dealing with Asher to check them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "Could Keith have found Hazel?"</span></p><div class="pagination">
