  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lara</span><span> quickly pulled away from Alexander, feeling a bit embarrassed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Charlize's eyes met hers, and in an instant, </span><span>Lara</span><span> noticed the jealousy and envy in </span><span>Charlize's gaze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lara</span><span> gave a little huff, then boldly kissed Alexander on the cheek, as if staking her claim.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Charlize rolled her eyes and whispered in Alexander's ear, "Boss, Sebastian and Evan are at Spring Bar..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander nodded, waved goodbye to </span><span>Lara</span><span>, and left the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He'd noticed the rivalry between Charlize and </span><span>Lara</span><span> but figured it was best not to get involved in such matters.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, being </span><span>strong enough</span><span>, he would always be surrounded by women.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was nearing 4 a.m., and everything was still.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A few sleepy security guards stood by the entrance of Spring Bar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The bar had passed its prime hours. Most patrons had left, leaving just a few couples cozied up in their booths.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander slipped in through the back entrance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Augusta and Marvin were tasked with secretly guarding Ava and Ashley, while Logan was keeping an eye on Sebastian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Boss, Sebastian and Evan are in that VIP room at the end of the hall," Logan said, pointing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander patted him on the shoulder. "Good job."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Logan perked up. "Thank you, boss. It's no trouble at all."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stand guard outside. Let no one near!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, boss!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Alexander strode confidently into the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The VIP room reeked of smoke, alcohol, perfume, and the lingering scent of recent intimacy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who's there?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Alexander stepped inside, a burly bald man shot up, pushing a woman aside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dressed in martial attire, his face showed fierce determination. His fists clenched, showing hardened knuckles&mdash;a clear sign of a skilled fighter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian lounged on the couch, holding a half-empty bottle, completely dazed from the drink.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan lay passed out beside two naked women, enjoying himself after finally recovering from an injury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander cast a scornful look at the bald man and said coldly, "If you want to live, get out now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The bald man's face froze. Only one person could be this cocky&mdash;that Alexander Sebastian mentioned before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What about Drake and his apprentice?" the bald man asked cautiously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander chuckled. "If I'm here, what do you think happened to them?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The bald man scowled, hurriedly shaking Sebastian's shoulder. "Mr. Tate, wake up! There's trouble!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amused, Alexander simply watched.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian eventually opened his eyes, still groggy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Tate, Drake's in trouble! Alexander's here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?" Sebastian jolted </span><span>awake,</span><span> his eyes wide in terror.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he saw Alexander at the door, he almost fainted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander... you're alive? Did something happen to Drake? It can't be..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If even the dark wizard Drake couldn't stop Alexander, Sebastian had no idea what to do next.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Drake had mentioned that their current state of health was only temporary. Unless they killed Alexander, they would never be truly free.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian quickly pulled out his phone to contact Drake.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But no matter how many times he tried, there was no answer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He then tried calling Jimbo, but again, no response&mdash;no calls, no messages back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander didn't interfere, simply watching him with a chillingly amused gaze, as if looking at a dead man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Turning around, Sebastian shouted at the bald man, "Mr. Manning, that's Alexander! You've already taken my 30 million dollars. Now it's time for you to earn it. Kill him, and I'll add another 50 million!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Master Liu, he is Wang Peng. You have already received 30 million US dollars from me. Now it's time for you to contribute."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill him and I'll give you another 50 million!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
