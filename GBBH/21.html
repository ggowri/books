  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander's aura turned lethal as he thought with a dark resolve, "You dared to challenge me, so now, I must respond with a ferocity that leaves no room for mercy."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the suite perched on the 30th floor of the Mayflower Hotel, a middle-aged man with a visage as stern as stone peered through the scope of a sniper rifle, his sights set on Alexander.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His name was William Pierce, a retired special force operative, a veteran of the Afhan War, where he had sniped and vanquished over a dozen terrorists.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Upon his return, William had enlisted as an assassin on the Dark Web, earning the moniker "Beast." He had successfully executed more than twenty contracts, each rewarded handsomely.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Today's assignment was the most lucrative he had ever accepted, a bounty of five million dollars.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With this kill, he could finally retire.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">William gripped the Barrett sniper rifle with a fervor. His heart was racing with anticipation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This weapon was his beloved; the souls it had claimed seemed to imbue it with an otherworldly aura.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As the crosshairs aligned with Alexander, an inexplicable sense of danger washed over him. Alexander knew he was the target, not Ava.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He knew it was another assassin sent by his rivals!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The air crackled with imminent peril.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander caught the faint click of a trigger being eased back, and in that instant, the Force within him surged like a tidal wave. His muscles coiled tightly, poised like a rocket on the brink of ignition.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A bullet, nearly invisible to the naked eye, hurtled towards Alexander, aimed at his head.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander, attuned to the Force, tracked its trajectory with preternatural precision.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The bullet, intended for him, could pierce the chest of a young boy standing behind him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The Barrett, renowned among sniper rifles for its lethal precision, fired bullets that streaked through the air like bolts of lightning.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Despite Alexander's premonition of danger, there was no time for hesitation. He could only pull Ava into a protective embrace, pushing the boy down in the process.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The entire ordeal unfolded in mere seconds, too fast for Ava to comprehend.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What's happening? What's going on?" she stammered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her eyes were wide with terror as she sensed the gravity of the situation from Alexander's expression.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Bang!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The bullet missed its mark, effortlessly drilling through the concrete floor.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava was paralyzed with fear at the sight of the deep crater in the ground, a chilling reminder of the high-powered sniper's bullet that had just missed her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Before she could process the danger, Alexander had already whisked her behind the cover of a nearby van.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Another shot rang out, leaving a second deep scar on the ground.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was only then that the distant sound of gunfire reached their ears, carried by the wind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Someone's trying to kill me!?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava's face paled. She mistakenly believed she was the intended target.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If not for Alexander, she would have met her demise.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Gratitude flooded her heart, and she clung to Alexander with all her might.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The third shot shattered the car window but harmed neither of them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Finally, others noticed the chaos. Their screams of terror pierced the air as they fled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Help! Someone's shooting!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Call the police!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">By now, Alexander and Ava were completely shielded by the vehicle, so William had lost his opportunity to strike.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Damn it! I was too careless! No wonder this guy's worth five million dollars. He's not just skilled; he's got the luck of the devil..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">William seethed, rapidly dismantling his rifle and packing it away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He slung his backpack over his shoulder and swiftly exited the room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His murderous aura dissipated with his departure.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander felt a wave of relief wash over him, finally able to breathe freely.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava spotted droplets of crimson on the ground.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander had been injured while shielding her. Even a graze from a sniper's bullet could be fatal.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava's eyes welled with anxious tears as she embraced Alexander tightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"How are you? Are you okay?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Seeing Alexander's reassuring smile, Ava began to wail uncontrollably.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As Alexander had dodged the first shot, he had been grazed by the bullet while trying to save the child, but the Force had shielded him, making the injury less severe than it could have been.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava held Alexander close, and her ample bosom was pressed against him, soft and inviting.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The subtle fragrance of her body enveloped Alexander, who instantly had a boner.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava immediately felt the hardness pressing against her. Her face flushed with a mix of embarrassment and irritation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You're injured, and you're still excited? What are you thinking about at a time like this?"</p><div class="pagination">
