  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright! I'll give you a billion as compensation..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At last, Felix made up his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, Barry was a level-three metahuman and a martial arts expert, and this was the Morris family's territory.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he refused, the Morris family would turn on him, and he'd be done for. He couldn't expect any courtesy from them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hahaha..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barry burst into loud laughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Very well! From now on, you're a valued guest of the Morris family. Come on in."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For the first time, he gestured for him to enter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you, Mr. Morris. Here's to a successful partnership."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix's expression softened a bit as he followed Barry toward the massive estate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But inside, he was still seething with fury and resentment. All of this was because of that bastard, Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Desperate for an outlet for his rage, Felix felt his killing intent rising. He quickly activated his powers to suppress his anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His head cleared a bit; now wasn't the time to confront the Morris family. He needed to wait until they and Alexander were at each other's throats to reap the benefits.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, Diego sensed something, paused, and looked back at Felix.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A strange gleam flickered in his deep-set eyes, as if he could read Felix's thoughts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix shuddered slightly and forced a casual smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He grew wary; though Diego wasn't a metahuman, he was a seasoned martial artist with decades of experience.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That piercing presence and gaze made Felix's blood run cold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thankfully, Diego just glanced at him before turning away and following Barry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix took a deep breath to steady himself, then followed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, the group entered the grand estate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was like a palace. The pavilions, towers, all exuded an antique charm and rich history.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Exquisite, costly decor and lush greenery were everywhere.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barry led Felix through twists and turns until they reached a small courtyard, Barry's residence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix was quietly shocked, realizing that many powerful figures were hidden throughout the estate. The Morris family's strength ran far deeper than it seemed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barry casually sat on the leather sofa while Diego and Joyce stood respectfully on either side of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix sat beside Barry, observing the room's incredible luxury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Care for a cigar?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barry opened an ornate cigar box, pulled out a cigar, and handed it to Felix.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, he placed one in his own mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joyce leaned forward, her low neckline generously displaying her figure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She picked up a solid gold, diamond-encrusted lighter and lit Barry's cigar with care.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barry chuckled, casually running his hand over Joyce's thigh, making her let out a soft sound.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diego stood there motionless, clearly used to the display.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix, however, was growing restless; he knew Alexander was likely on his way to </span><span>Kingsdon</span><span>, perhaps even there already.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Morris, may I ask what the plan is?" he asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Phew..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barry blew out a large smoke ring, glanced at Felix, and said, "You injected Alexander's daughter with an unproven genetic serum. That grudge is unbreakable, and he's already on his way here. Don't worry. He hates you enough to seek you out. We'll just wait for him to walk right into our trap!... By the way, the Kaylon just opened a new casino on the coast. I want to unwind there."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Kaylon's new casino?" Felix paused, then grew furious at Barry's attitude.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He just pressed his lips together without saying a word, keeping silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barry smiled with confidence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Heh, you must have people watching the airport. The Morris family has its own intel network; the moment Alexander arrives in </span><span>Kingsdon</span><span>, we'll have eyes on him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My son is gone, so obviously I'm in a bad mood. I'll gamble a bit first; we'll wait for him to walk into our trap."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix sneered, thinking, "Your bad mood makes you want to gamble? How does throwing money away help with that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix had already learned that, aside from his known son, Raven, Barry had a few illegitimate sons in secret.</span></p><div class="pagination">
