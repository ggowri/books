  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who do you think you are, kid? Sticking your nose where it doesn't belong? You're asking for trouble!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A big guy yelled as he charged at Alexander, swinging a heavy punch at his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Pathetic."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander scoffed, kicking out without much effort.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The big guy might've swung first, but Alexander was faster.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His kick sent the man flying, and he landed right next to another thug, who was already groaning in pain, clutching his stomach.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two remaining thugs were terrified, realizing they were way out of their depth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One kick, and their buddy was down&mdash;this guy was definitely no ordinary guy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shing!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They both pulled knives from their belts, the blades glinting as they unsheathed them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They waved them around, trying to look tough while threatening Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kid, you better back off if you know what's good for you. Get </span><span>outta</span><span> here, or you're not </span><span>gonna</span><span> live long!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, beat it while you still can! Otherwise, this knife's going in clean, coming out bloody!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander just smirked at the two who were shouting, and instead of backing off, he started walking toward them, step by step.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One step. Two steps. Three steps&mdash;getting closer and closer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The tension was thick, pressing down on them like a weight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two thugs watched in horror as Alexander kept advancing, their faces paling and their hearts pounding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stay back! Don't come any closer!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One of them couldn't take the pressure any longer. He yelled and lunged forward, stabbing at Alexander's chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander, with a look of disdain, grabbed his wrist and twisted it hard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A loud crack echoed down the alley, followed by the thug's scream as his hand twisted into an unnatural shape, looking like a claw.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The last thug turned and ran for it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander couldn't be bothered to chase him. Instead, he kicked a knife lying on the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wham!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The knife flew through the air like an arrow, piercing the thug's chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He let out a scream, collapsing to the ground with a gaping wound, blood pouring out like a fountain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In no time, Alexander had taken care of all four thugs. Only then did he turn his attention to the young woman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was attractive, but compared to the women Alexander had been around, she didn't quite measure up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The woman's coat had already been ripped off by the thugs, and she was left in just a tight-fitting undershirt that had been pulled halfway up, her pale stomach exposed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her face was flushed with fear and embarrassment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander asked, "</span><span>You</span><span> okay?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The woman stammered, "I... I'm alright. Thank you for saving me..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander asked her what had happened, and she explained.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It turned out this was her first time on Treasure Island, here for an auction. She'd had a bit too much to drink last night at a bar and ended up running into some trouble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"When's this auction happening?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander asked, his interest piqued.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's today," she replied quickly. "I heard the Brilliant Group is looking for a pharmaceutical production line, and my factory recently went under. The production line is still top-notch, so I came here to try and auction it off."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander nodded and then turned to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wait! Please!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The woman called out to </span><span>him,</span><span> her voice anxious. "Can I hire you as my bodyguard?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bodyguard?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander chuckled, waving her off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Treasure Island's got strict laws. Just don't wander around alone, and you'll be fine."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, the sound of hurried footsteps grew louder, getting closer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A heavily armed patrol unit rushed over, guns drawn the moment they saw the men on the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hands in the air!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is Treasure Island. You can't just kill people here like it's nothing."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander looked at the patrol officers with interest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were all big, well-built, radiating a hardened aura&mdash;clearly battle-tested.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The captain, in particular, had something unusual about him&mdash;he was a metahuman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's All-seeing Eyes could detect a strange energy circulating in his body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hands in the air!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The captain shouted at Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The woman beside him was terrified, trembling as she had no idea what to do.</span></p><div class="pagination">
