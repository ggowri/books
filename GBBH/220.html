  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julia looked at Kevin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Young man, there are always people better than you. Don't think you are invincible."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kevin said impatiently, "You're bragging. Hurry up and call the people you invited.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Humph, there is no one in </span><span>Loscity</span><span> who can beat Kevin!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angelica chimed in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander stood out from the crowd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said, "Kevin, I will fight you on behalf of Julia."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aiden looked angry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander laughed and said, "What? Are you scared?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angelica started cursing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You bastard! My dad invited you to dinner yesterday and gave you gem. How dare you help Julia? You are so ungrateful and shameless."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander glanced at her and said sarcastically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You are the ones who have no shame. Don't you want to take the gem back?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As long as you beat me, I will return the gem to you and compensate you ten million dollars. How about that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angelica said, "Okay! It's a deal. But I don't think you have so much money."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She looked down on Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kevin injured his ankle yesterday, and he originally suspected that Alexander was responsible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the victory made him lose his mind. Now he was ambitious and had the arrogance to beat anyone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kevin pointed at Alexander arrogantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop talking nonsense. I'll teach you a lesson today."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angelica clapped her hands excitedly. "Yes! Kevin, break both of his legs to help me get revenge."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kevin said, "Yes, I want him to spend the rest of his life in a wheelchair."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Murderous intent flashed in Kevin's eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aiden also nodded. "Okay, this is a life-and-death fight. There are no restrictive rules. Everyone is on the ring voluntarily, no matter if they die or get injured."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander didn't want to speak and went straight to Kevin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Xavier asked worriedly, "Mom, will Alexander win?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julia, however, was full of confidence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She said, "Xavier, you don't know his strength. He's one of </span><span>Loscity's</span><span> best fighters."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Xavier stared at Alexander nervously, wanting to say something but stopping himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was not as well-informed as Julia, so he didn't know what Alexander had done.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julia only knew that Alexander had a strong background, was backed by the president of the Saint Group, and had once defeated Joseph of the Cripples.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Very few people at the scene recognized Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Isn't that guy Alexander? The one who's been famous lately."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, it's him. I heard that he broke Joseph's hand on the spot. Why does he come here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't let him hear us. He controls magic powder now, and all the major families and companies have to respect him. He is a big shot in </span><span>Loscity</span><span>."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Nonsense! He can't develop magic powder. Ava must have given him the formula. Without Ava, he is nothing."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Several people were talking with envy and jealousy, as well as the gloating feeling of wanting to see Alexander get beaten up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander said, "You just said you were going to break my legs?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander looked at Kevin coldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hit Kevin in the ankle with a stone, yesterday. Alexander didn't use much force, or Kevin would have been badly hurt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kevin had a look of disdain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said, "Are you scared? Apologize immediately, and I will consider letting you go."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aiden shouted to Kevin, "Kevin, stop talking nonsense. Destroy him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angelica echoed, "Kevin, don't be soft-hearted. Beat him up!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kevin said, "You should not offend my girlfriend! Come on!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kevin roared angrily and tried to grab Alexander's throat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's expression became even colder when he saw Kevin's move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was motionless, as if he was frightened by Kevin. And there was a sudden commotion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kevin felt that he had a sure win.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the next second, Kevin's confident shot missed the mark.</span></p><div class="pagination">
