  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix paused, a strange light glinting in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Andrew gave Jane a hard shove. "Jane, have you lost it? This is Mr. Vanderbilt, the Red Umbrella Group's chairman!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Belinda quickly reached out to feel Jane's forehead, apologizing to Felix, "Mr. Vanderbilt, I'm so sorry. My daughter's been running a high fever and isn't thinking straight."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane stepped back, giving them a displeased glare.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom, Dad, what are you doing? I'm not crazy! After all the setbacks we've had, have we learned nothing?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix suddenly burst into laughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Fairfax, are you getting ideas? I never considered making </span><span>you</span><span> my woman. You're just... not qualified!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane's face darkened even more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Vanderbilt, if that's the case, please leave."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Felix remained calm and said, "Ms. Fairfax, you and Alexander have a daughter named Ashley, right?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"All I need is for Ashley to participate in a research project. If you agree, I'll send you one billion dollars in cash immediately. Plus, I'll make the Fairfax family a supplier for the Red Umbrella Group, with guaranteed annual profits of at least five billion. How does that sound?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Fairfax family was stunned, not expecting such a proposition from Felix.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Andrew asked excitedly, "Mr. Vanderbilt, are you serious?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix nodded with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My word is as good as gold. We can draw up a partnership agreement. As long as Ashley participates in the project, I'll keep my promise."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Good! This is great!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Andrew clapped his hands in excitement, quickly urging Jane, "Jane, what are you waiting for? This is an incredible opportunity! All Ashley has to do is join the research, and we'll not only get one billion right away, but also at least five billion a year from now on! That's a fortune!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Belinda was also visibly thrilled, her body shaking with excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Jane, why aren't you saying anything? Hurry up and agree to Mr. Vanderbilt's offer. This is a golden opportunity."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane stayed silent for a while before finally speaking up, "Mr. Vanderbilt, what exactly is this research project, and why does it need a four-year-old girl? Are you planning to experiment on her?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix gave a mysterious smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Fairfax, it's a matter of corporate confidentiality, so I can't share the details."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Andrew couldn't help but give Jane a strong shove, snapping angrily, "I'm Ashley's grandfather, and I've agreed to this. Don't worry, Mr. Vanderbilt. I'll make sure Ashley joins. Let's sign the agreement."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Excellent!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix, satisfied, gestured for someone to bring the agreement over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane was still hesitant, sensing that this matter was far from simple.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though she wasn't as devoted to her daughter as Alexander, Ashley was still her child, and Jane felt something for her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Jane, sign it already! The Red Umbrella Group is such a big company, offering us one billion plus a solid contract. Are you really worried Ashley will get hurt?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Andrew kept pushing her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Belinda urged her as well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Honey, if Mr. Vanderbilt is willing to sign a contract, it can't be anything bad. Ashley is just joining a research project, not facing any danger. What are you afraid of?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix pulled out a crisp check, filled in one billion, and pushed it toward Jane with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing the long string of numbers on the check, Jane felt a surge of excitement. After hesitating again and again, she finally gritted her teeth and signed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Very good!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix, highly pleased, put away the agreement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Fairfax, please have Ashley at the Red Umbrella research facility within a week. If you fail to do so, the contract stipulates a ten-billion-dollar penalty."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane cautiously asked, "Mr. Vanderbilt, could you give me some hint about this research project?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix chuckled slyly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A genetic research project, but I can't reveal much for now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Genetic research?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane's face was blank as she watched Felix and his entourage stride away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clutching the one-billion check, Jane couldn't help wondering if she had made another mistake.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inside the van, Calvin and his men were on their phones while the bald man kept watch on Lily's villa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Keep a close eye on things. Don't let anything slip. Once this is done, we'll get a huge reward," Calvin reminded him with a grin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After talking for a while with no response, he instantly flew into a rage.</span></p><div class="pagination">
