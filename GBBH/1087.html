  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander hurried forward and took the lead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Emma followed him closely behind, and the two trekked in the mountain one after the other.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Follow me. Watch out for snakes."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander broke off a thick tree branch and held it in his hand to clear a path, looking for the herbs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before long, he collected the two needed herbs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Not bad, not bad. If we find three more herbs, we can go back."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Emma looked at the two herbs with great curiosity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Alex, can these herbs really cure Alvin?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander said confidently, "Yes, of course. In fact, this is a prescription for detoxifying poison. It can eliminate the potion from Alvin's body."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ah, poison?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Emma was surprised and quickly grabbed Alexander's hand with fright.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Alex, you are awesome. You know everything."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She looked at Alexander's handsome face, and her face turned red.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander couldn't help but glance at Emma's sensual body, but he gently shook off her hand and said, "Hurry up. There are three more herbs to be found."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He pretended not to notice the expectation and desire in Emma's charming eyes, focusing on looking for the herbs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander went up to a tree full of small red fruits and picked a few of them, saying with a smile, "This fruit is sweet and good for the skin. The fruit juice can heal the pimple on your face."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Is it that magical?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Emma widened her eyes in surprise and admired Alexander even more. She felt that this man was an encyclopedia and knew everything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If you don't believe me, try it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As Alexander ate the fruit, he peeled the skin of a fruit and handed it to Emma.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Alex, thank you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Emma squeezed the white juice from the fruit and applied it to the pimple.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The juice was cool, and Emma felt good. It was great.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Women wanted to be beautiful. Besides, Alexander taught her this. Emma was delighted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She said to Alexander coyly, "Alex, after you find all the herbs, I'll treat you to dinner, okay?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander didn't say a word as if he was too focused on finding the herbs to hear her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Emma felt instantly disappointed, but at the same time, she became more determined to get Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She had always been very proud of her charm. Countless men had accosted and pursued her, but Alexander was not fascinated by her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Emma thought more highly of Alexander, at the sight of whom she couldn't help but have all kinds of fantasies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When thinking of those lustful scenes, Emma felt her heart beating faster and turned red.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This man was young and handsome. He was a good fighter and had medical skills as well as pursuing perfection.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander sensed the burning gaze behind him and could only smile bitterly. He didn't want to gradually degenerate and become a Corrupted Warrior.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After trekking for a while, Emma couldn't help but take out her cell phone and use it as a mirror to look at her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ah, it's healed."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She was shocked. It was miraculous. The red pimple was almost healed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander smiled and didn't take such a trifle to heart at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Alexander collected two more herbs. There was only one herb left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They had entered the dense forest, and there was no one around.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When Alexander saw that Emma was exhausted and out of breath, he stopped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Are you tired? Let's take a break."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Okay."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Emma wiped the sweat from her forehead and said awkwardly, "I'll take a pee. Please wait for me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander said, "Okay. Hurry up. We have to find the last herb. It will be difficult after it gets dark."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Emma walked carefully to the bushes next to her. Before long, the sound of dripping water was heard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Of course, Alexander knew what Emma was doing. He couldn't help licking his lips. It would be a lie to say that he was not attracted by this mature and beautiful woman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ah! Help!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Suddenly, a scream was heard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander immediately jumped up and rushed into the bushes like an arrow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He saw Emma squatting on the ground with her pants taken off, revealing her fair and plump buttocks. The beautiful sight quickened Alexander's heartbeat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Emma screamed with a pale face, "Snake! A snake bit me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"A snake?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander saw a small snake with patterns all over its body slithering into the bushes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He immediately swung up the tree trunk and hit the poisonous snake hard on the head.</span></p><div class="pagination">
