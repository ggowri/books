  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The immense force pinned her to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blood gushed from Adara's mouth continuously. She tried to scream for help, but only inarticulate sounds escaped her throat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Guzman yanked the scepter out and viciously stabbed down again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adara was beyond help. The strength in her body dissipated swiftly, her mouth moving soundlessly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, Guzman felt a warm, strange energy flow through the scepter and into his body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adara's life force nourished Guzman's depleted physique, invigorating his spirit and filling him with power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Guzman was ecstatic. This was really a treasure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adara's body withered rapidly, like a desiccated grape, turning into an empty husk in the blink of an eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Guzman folded the corpse, now brittle like old tree bark, and hid it deep within the cave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, feigning nonchalance, he lay on the blanket, savoring the brimming vitality within him while caressing the magical short stick.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He noticed words etched at the base: Ancestral Witch's Cane.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was a staff left by ancient wizards. The scepter was carved with tiny script as dense as flies' heads.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Guzman had initially thought they were mere patterns. They were, in fact, recorded witchcraft.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Overjoyed, he immediately began to meditate according to the inscriptions. With his eyes closed, he appeared to be sleeping but was, in fact, meditating and digesting the life force provided by Adara.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Ancestral Witch's Cane was indeed a treasure!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Guzman opened his eyes, his body had fully recovered, even stronger than before, and he had learned simple curse witchcraft.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, his confidence was unshakable, and all his negative emotions vanished without a trace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Guzman's eyes were filled with hatred. What he had to do now was wait for those female demons to take the bait, to die one by one under the scepter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Adara? Is Adara here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alyosha strode into the cave, glanced around suspiciously, and fixed her gaze on Guzman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Guzman didn't move, his eyes slightly closed, seemingly fast asleep.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alyosha immediately let her guard down. She approached Guzman and kicked him hard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't sleep, lazybones! Have you seen Adara?" Alyosha demanded harshly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah! Don't hit me... Alyosha, don't hit me. I haven't seen Adara..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Guzman jolted awake, pleading with Alyosha, his face full of fear and terror.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Didn't Adara come? She told me she was coming to find you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Guzman's cowardly demeanor, Alyosha relaxed her vigilance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Where did she go?" Alyosha frowned in confusion, muttering to herself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Guzman wouldn't be a match for Adara even if he tried something," Alyosha reassured herself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She circled the area. The blood Adara had spilled earlier had been absorbed by the Ancestral Witch's Cane, leaving no trace of wrongdoing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alyosha, actually, I like you the most..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Guzman knelt on the ground, gently caressing Alyosha's calf, gradually moving upwards.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alyosha was initially stunned, then her cheeks flushed with excitement under Guzman's touch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Guzman, your behavior is strange today. You weren't like this before..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alyosha, you are the most beautiful. You never appear alone, so how could I tell you before?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Guzman spoke with deep affection, "Alyosha, how about we leave here together? I just want to be with you. I think you feel the same way, don't you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To lower Alyosha's guard, Guzman feigned flattery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They all admired Guzman's handsome appearance. Otherwise, they would have killed him long ago. Naturally, Alyosha was swayed by his sweet words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You want to elope with me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alyosha felt something was off but was still excited. She felt shy for the first time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Guzman embraced her from behind, gently positioning her to lie face </span><span>down on the rock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alyosha became aroused, wriggling her hips in anticipation of Guzman.</span></p><div class="pagination">
