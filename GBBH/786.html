  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander was surprised. The white wizard was indeed powerful and was not dead yet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Please don't kill me! Please..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Half of Rock's face showed an expression of fear. His mouth was still moving, and he was begging for mercy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"When you teamed up with Felix to harm my daughter, and when you fought with me for the Treasure Island, did you ever think of today?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander looked at Rock with contempt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He stabbed out his Lightsaber.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Under everyone's shocked gaze, Rock's two halves of the body were split into four.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Rock was still not dead. He kept blinking and moving his mouth. "You can't kill me. You can't kill me..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander smiled in disdain, "I can't kill you, but I can burn you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He waved his hand, and pale flames instantly took over Rock's body with a sizzling sound.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Rock screamed miserably and cursed Alexander with all kinds of vicious words. But then, he begged for mercy desperately, but to no avail.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After a while, his corpse, along with the black gas, disappeared without a trace under the Force Burning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everybody present fell silent. All the wizards stared at it in a daze, with indescribable shock and fear in their hearts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Rock was worthy of being a white wizard. Not only was his attack sharp, but he was also immortal. It was beyond human cognition.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Alexander was even more terrifying. He just burned Rock to death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this time, Alexander calmly picked up the Ancient Grimoire that had fallen on the ground, flipped through it briefly, and put it away with great satisfaction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He finally collected the Ancestral Witch's Cane, the Ancient Grimoire, and the Spirit Bead Bracelet, all of which were treasures left behind by that ancient wizard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander believed that when the three treasures were put together, he would unlock many secrets.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>There was a dead silence!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hundreds of wizards turned pale and clenched their fists. Their breathing became rapid.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If they hadn't seen it with their eyes, they would never believe that Alexander killed a white wizard in just a few moves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was something that was really happening right before their eyes, but it seemed like a fairy tale.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Including Monica, no one in the City of Sorcery could understand what the glowing saber in Alexander's hand was that could ignore all witchcraft.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As far as they understood, all sabers and even guns were subject to witchcraft.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But this mysterious Lightsaber was utterly immune to witchcraft.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander shrugged, spread his hands, and said, "That's all he had. You can't blame me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The hall was still deathly silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Rock's death made all wizards feel fear, including Monica.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Monica's wrinkled old face showed a ferocious expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She roared at Alexander, "How dare you kill Rock on the day of our celebration! Alexander, I will kill your women, your child, and everyone related to you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander became furious at her words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His daughter and family were the ones he wanted to protect with his life. Monica dared to threaten him with them. Alexander decided to kill her no matter what the cost to avoid future troubles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Lightsaber in his hand flashed, and he hurled it towards Monica.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The dazzling light made a sound of tearing the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Monica was roaring madly, and her roar stopped abruptly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ugh! You..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She felt a sharp pain in her chest, and her blood spurted out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Monica froze. As if someone had cast a spell on her, she just stood there motionless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hundreds of wizards around were in an uproar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing their shocked eyes, Monica moved her lips, unable to believe what had happened to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She lowered her head very slowly, and she suddenly widened her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Monica saw a bloody hole in her chest, which went from the front chest to the back. The scorching heat burned the wound. Otherwise, she would have died long ago.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Lightsaber that Alexander had just thrown was deeply embedded in the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Monica couldn't believe it. Alexander was so fast that she couldn't react at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She covered her chest with her hands. The Lightsaber had melted half of her heart, and the remaining half was burned black.</span></p><div class="pagination">
