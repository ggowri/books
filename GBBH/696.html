  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their combat exoskeletons could withstand ordinary gunfire, but now the left chest pieces were utterly shattered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>William was using armor-piercing rounds capable of penetrating light armor. Enhanced by vampire powers, these shots could even punch through a main battle tank's plating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as three bodies hit the ground, more gunshots rang out in quick succession.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Red Umbrella Group's first elite squad hadn't even reached the blood mist before losing over a dozen men.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>William lurking in the blood mist with firearm power marksmanship was absolutely unstoppable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His shooting and reloading speed was incredible, and his vampire-enhanced bullets not only packed an extra punch but could curve through the air to track their targets.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite being an elite force equipped with top-tier combat </span><span>exoskeletons,</span><span> they were reduced to mere shooting practice for William's deadly accuracy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What the hell? This is impossible!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix and Rock were stunned, their jaws practically on the floor. If they hadn't seen it with their own eyes, they wouldn't have believed it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even the remaining members of the first elite squad were dumbfounded. When they finally snapped out of it, more than half turned tail and ran.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one wanted to die. No amount of money from the Red Umbrella Group was worth their lives.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>William took three more unhurried shots.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Three more enemies fell, and the red mist quickly spread to engulf their bodies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The freshly killed bodies' blood was still warm as the vampire bats devoured it, leaving the corpses to fade within seconds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gorged on blood, the bats grew massive, their claws razor-sharp, and their resilience doubled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No! Please don't kill me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One lucky survivor hadn't been killed instantly, and armor-piercing rounds had torn away his left arm and the flesh from the left side of his chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Terror filled his face. Despite wearing a state-of-the-art combat exoskeleton, he'd been reduced to such a pitiful state.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Go to hell!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>William sneered as he pulled the trigger, blowing the man's head clean off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The vampire bats swarmed the body, reducing the skilled fighter to a dried husk in seconds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the blink of an eye, the Red Umbrella Group's first elite squad, sixty members strong, had been decimated. Only five escaped, while William picked off all the rest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>William gasped for air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even with his current abilities, executing dozens of rapid-fire sniper shots had taken its toll.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What the hell are we dealing with? A vampire with firearm powers? That's impossible!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix couldn't believe his eyes, his fists clenching so hard they might shatter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His top-tier elite squad, built with over twenty billion dollars of investment and </span><span>endless effort, had been destroyed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He fixed Hana with an icy stare and snarled through gritted teeth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hana, I shared the formula for the power elixir and partnered with the Sakra Society because you swore up and down you could provide massive support.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But look what's happened now my first elite squad is completely wiped out. Why didn't your third unit coordinate the attack?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your leadership failure cost me my elite squad!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not only was Felix furious, but Rock was also glaring at Hana. His voice dripped with venom as he said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hana, you're the Sakra Society's envoy, representing their honor. Aren't you warriors supposed to care about honor above all else?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Standing beside Felix, they were clearly trying to force Hana onto the battlefield.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hana was so angry he nearly coughed up blood, his chest heaving with rage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You bastards! No need to pressure me. Since I represent the Sakra Society, I'll lead the third unit with full force when the time is right."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He cursed while taking deep breaths, struggling to contain his fury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is just their first trump card. Are you both really going to turn on me now? I sense they haven't shown their full strength yet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"However, I can tell that mysterious presence in the blood mist has weakened. I'll take care of them myself!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix's expression instantly changed as he smiled and flattered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"How noble of you, Mr. Salem! Don't worry, in less than ten minutes the magic formation will be fully activated. Then I'll have unlimited power enough to kill everyone on their side."</span></p><div class="pagination">
