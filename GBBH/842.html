  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ha ha ha!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marvin couldn't hold back and burst out laughing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander suppressed his laughter and whispered, "Well, have you measured it? How many inches?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Keith's face flushed deeper, too embarrassed to answer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander managed to stifle his smile and, with a serious face, pressed further, "Don't be shy, just say it. How long?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I... I've measured it... only twelve inches... so I don't pass. The minimum is sixteen, and eighteen is considered excellent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Boss, I shouldn't go in. I'm sure I won't pass again."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Keith looked utterly defeated, sighing heavily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander covered his mouth, a slight twitch betraying his amusement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Medically speaking, twelve inches isn't extremely short. Don't worry. I have a way to help. You can go ahead with the interview confidently."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With that, he channeled the Force into Keith's body, allowing it to modify him from within.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The human body is made up of bones, muscles, blood vessels, nerves, and internal organs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The male anatomy is primarily composed of spongy tissue, and the Force could infiltrate it, aiding it to expand to more than double its usual size when stimulated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The effect was temporary, but Alexander believed it would show results quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This Force in Keith's body would not only increase size but also allow him to control duration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Whether it was lasting two to three minutes or enduring for dozens, Keith would be in control.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But there was a cost; Keith's body wasn't as strong as Alexander's.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Prolonged use of this Force would gradually damage Keith's body, shortening his lifespan by about ten years.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander didn't mention this side effect for now, planning to tell Keith later.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If he refused, Alexander could withdraw the Force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yet Alexander knew no man would give up such an enhancement after experiencing its benefits.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Trading ten years of life for doubled length and time control was a deal most men would accept without hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Keith not only overcame his physical shortcomings, but the Force within him transformed his entire demeanor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Previously, Keith's face was pale, his eyes lifeless, with dark circles prominent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Now, Keith was full of energy, standing tall and looking far more presentable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Keith didn't know what Alexander had done, but he felt a mysterious warm current moving through his body, filling him with boundless strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Especially between his legs, which felt significantly larger than usual.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Boss, thank you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Keith's face was a mix of shock, excitement, and gratitude.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Boss, you're my savior. I'll be the best undercover agent. I'll face anything, no matter how tough."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He had already been loyal to Alexander; now he was unwaveringly devoted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander gave a slight smile. "Enough talking, let's go."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Just then, Shirley led them to the entrance of a large hall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Over here, fill out these forms first."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She handed three forms to Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Wait, not you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Shirley snatched the form from Keith's hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You've applied before and failed the physical requirements! Why are you here wasting time again? Do you want me to beat you?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Get out before I have to use force!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Shirley pulled out her baton again, glaring fiercely at Keith.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Keith's expression shifted, and he said firmly, "Don't worry, this time I'll pass. I'm over eighteen inches now&mdash;definitely excellent."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Pfft! Do you think you're an earthworm? That thing doesn't just grow to eighteen inches because you say so! Get lost!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Shirley scoffed, raising her baton.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I am over eighteen inches now. If you don't believe me, test it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Keith stood tall, full of confidence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Shirley's expression changed as she asked, "Did you get some enhancement surgery? We only hire natural applicants; no surgery allowed."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander spoke up, "Since he claims to be over eighteen inches, why not let him try? It won't waste much time."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A sharp glint flashed in Alexander's eyes, and Shirley, influenced by the Force Control, paused before murmuring, "Alright, come in."</span></p><div class="pagination">
