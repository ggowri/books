  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander tore up all of Ariella's clothes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was exposed to him in her scanty bikini.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A blush spread from Ariella's face to her neck. She was shy. Her plump and attractive body trembled slightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander," she groaned. Instead of struggling, she seemed to seduce Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He took a deep breath and finally suppressed his burning desire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Above Ariella's body was a large black shadow, which quickly covered her shoulders, her full breasts, her abdomen, her hips, and her thighs. It was terrifying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, hug me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, Ariella struggled to pounce on Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He immediately held her. "Stay still. I will detoxicate you right now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"S-Stop lying. You just want me. Anyway, I'm dying now. I'm willing to have sex with you before my death..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ariella, the heir to the Obsidian Gang, was still a virgin despite having been in a relationship.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had a crush on Alexander, and when he helped her recapture the gang, she admired him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now that he had stripped off her clothes, she had completely misunderstood and was willing to make love to him before her death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hug me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ariella tried to throw herself into Alexander's arms. However, her body was so numb that she couldn't move at all, as if she were frozen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh no! It's too late. I'm going to die..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ariella burst into tears out of anxiety, and her voice trembled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the face of death, overwhelmed by fear, injustice, and unwillingness, she longed to hide herself at once.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander comforted her softly, smiling, "Don't be afraid! I will detoxicate you. You won't die. Don't move. I will help you right away."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, hug me now. If my death is inevitable, I want to die in your arms..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ariella struggled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come on. Lie down."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander held Ariella and laid her prone on the sofa. As a result, her round buttocks became more backward.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her black thong was deeply embedded between her buttocks, showing a little blackness as if beckoning him...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked down at her and couldn't help licking his lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Who was the genius who invented such a thong with a thin black strap? In an instant, Alexander had an impulse to break her buttocks to find the complete thong.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He swallowed hard, exerted the Force, and put his hands on Ariella.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His fingers started from the back of her neck as if they were playing the piano.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was slow at first and then fast. He grew more and more skilled, his fingers leaping, pushing, pressing, and pinching with great rhythm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They gradually moved to Ariella's shoulders, her arms, her back, her breasts, her slim waist, and downward...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The powerful Force was being poured into her body, and soon, drops of dark sweat were oozing from her skin.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Light or heavy, the strength was precise, and each blow was aimed at removing poison from her body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander massaged Ariella with the Force, which could detoxify her and soothe her body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he touched her sensitive area of nerve aggregation, she experienced unspeakable stimulation and excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ariella held her breath from the beginning and now exclaimed, "It is so comfortable..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She felt as if her body was floating. As Alexander caressed her, a strange current ran through her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His fingertips brought a wonderful feeling to every inch of her body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, all the poison in Ariella's body was discharged, evaporated by the Force, and disappeared into the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her mind went blank, and she grew completely excited!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ariella's voice trembled. She gritted her teeth, trying hard not to hold back her shameful screams.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her mind was full of unspeakable fantasy pictures, each of which was related to Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, he paid no attention to her imagination at all, completely immersed in the detoxification.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Ariella had not been lying down, she could have seen his fingers, which seemed to be hundreds, thousands, and even countless, sliding rapidly over her fascinating body.&#8203;</span></p><div class="pagination">
