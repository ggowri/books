  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The woman causing all the fuss was Sienna from </span><span>Newbrook</span><span>, the princess of some prestigious musical dynasty who everyone called "the goddess of music" or whatever.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>So</span><span> you're the ones who messed with my violin. Do you have any idea how much this instrument costs? Could you even afford to replace it if you damaged it?" Sienna's face was ice-cold as she got in Ava's face, jabbing her finger like she owned the place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava had already reached her limit with this drama. She let out a scoff. "We just touched it twice. What kind of violin breaks because of that? I already apologized, and I'll pay for any damage. Why are you being such a pain about this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shut your mouth!" Sienna snapped, totally losing it when Ava dared to talk back. "You must be one of my haters, trying to sabotage my performance. This violin costs over a million dollars. You couldn't afford to replace it even if you sold everything </span><span>you own."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava couldn't help but laugh. "Over a million dollars? Wow, that must be so much money to you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sienna's face lit up with smug satisfaction. "Good that you realize you can't afford it. You're not leaving until I inspect it, and if there's even a scratch, you'll be hearing from my lawyers."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava's tone shifted to pure mockery. "Just a million dollars? And that's supposed to be impressive? Guess the so-called musical elite isn't as loaded as you pretend to be."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You... Stop talking nonsense!" Sienna looked like she was about to explode.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get them!" With a sharp wave of her hand, Sienna's security detail stepped forward. They were all matching black suits and shades, looking like they'd walked straight out of a movie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The other women, including the heavyset one, quickly closed ranks around Sienna.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All of them were in the music industry and naturally wanted to get on Sienna's good side. After all, the Rhodes family was music royalty with a serious pull in the business.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A single word from Sienna could boost their paychecks and industry clout in a heartbeat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, of course, these women were all too happy to take Sienna's side.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The heavyset woman had totally blown things out of proportion earlier, deliberately accusing Ava and Ashley just to score points with Sienna.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Where is Daddy? Daddy, I'm scared..." Ashley clung to Ava's leg, tears streaming down her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, now you're crying? You do something wrong and try to play the victim? Nice try, kid." The heavyset woman's voice turned ugly, her face twisting into something downright demonic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Grab them," she barked at the others. "I'll teach them a lesson for Sienna. Let's see if they ever touch other people's stuff again."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a nasty grin, she lunged for Ava while Ashley wailed in terror.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Back off!" A thunderous voice cut through the air. The heavyset woman went flying with a shriek, hitting the ground hard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A young, handsome man now stood between them, having backhanded her away like she was nothing more than an annoying fly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dad!" Ashley threw her arms around Alexander, tear streaks still glistening on her cheeks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The entire venue went dead silent. Every single person, from the stage to the audience, stared at Alexander in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who do you think you are?" Sienna's voice dripped with arrogance. "What kind of man hits people out of nowhere? And a woman, no less. You're a real tough guy, aren't you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She stormed forward, hand raised to slap Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he wasn't having any of it. Before she could strike, he caught her hand and returned the favor with a sharp slap of his own.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sienna crashed to the floor, completely stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her perfect face now sported an angry red handprint, the sting radiating through her jaw. She could even feel her teeth rattling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you have any idea who I am? You actually had the nerve to hit me?" She yelled like crazy, her composure completely shattered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Being slapped in front of thousands of people had broken something in her. Rage and humiliation warred on her face as she struggled to process what had just happened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, she was supposed to be the queen of the music industry, the golden girl everyone had pinned their hopes on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Industry bigshots, celebrities, men and women alike&mdash;they all looked up to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In Sienna's mind, she deserved that respect. She was untouchable, a goddess on her pedestal. And now, some random man had dared to knock her off it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The humiliation was unbearable. At that moment, Sienna wanted nothing more than to kill Alexander right there and then.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Murmurs and whispers rippled through the crowd below.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The music festival hadn't even started, yet their beloved music goddess had just been publicly humiliated&mdash;it was beyond belief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All eyes were fixed on Alexander. Some were stunned, others confused, and more than a few were clearly enjoying the spectacle.</span></p><div class="pagination">
