  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Billy pointed menacingly at the bald man.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Grab him, tie a stone to him, and toss him in the lake to feed the fish."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes, boss!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The others swarmed around, throwing a sack over the bald man's head. They beat him up, tied him tightly, and shoved him into a car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Ms. Blackburn, are you satisfied with how I handled this?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Billy looked at Ava anxiously, trying to please her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If Ava wasn't satisfied, he'd have no choice but to flee and never return to Loscity.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Finally, Ava nodded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'll let it slide this time. But if it happens again, you know the consequences."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Thank you, Ms. Blackburn, thank you!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Billy was overjoyed, thanking her profusely.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He had fought hard for over a decade in Loscity to establish the Wolf Gang's territory and wasn't about to give it up easily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander watched Ava with interest. Although he knew Ava was the president of the Saint Group, this was the first time he had seen a woman so commanding.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Why are you staring at me like that?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava's face flushed as she glared at Alexander.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The contrast between her cute, bashful look and the strong woman she had just been was striking.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Let's go. There's a nice store ahead. I'll help you pick out some good clothes."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She took Alexander's arm and led him forward.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Billy secretly breathed a sigh of relief. He hadn't expected Alexander to be Ava's friend. If the kidnapping had succeeded, he'd be dead by now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Boss, who exactly is this Ms. Blackburn? Why are you so afraid of her?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yeah, aren't we connected with the Blood Gang? Who do we need to fear?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Several of his men asked curiously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Billy's face darkened as he glared at them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You idiots! She's the president of the Saint Group, backed by the Godfather, known as the Reaper. Even the Blood Gang bows to her."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Godfather?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Everyone fell silent, their eyes filled with fear. They had just brushed with death.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Damn Jane! She told me Alexander had no background! How could he have no background and still dare to mess with Ryan?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"So what if Ryan could become vice president? He's still just a deputy."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"We can't afford to offend either side, damn it!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Billy cursed Jane as he and his men got into the car and sped off.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava led Alexander through the shopping district, quickly picking out several outfits.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"This one looks nice. Try it on."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava held a shirt up to Alexander's chest.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander was happy and didn't refuse.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He had been with Jane for five years, and she hadn't even bought him a pair of underwear, let alone any other clothes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava's choices suited his taste perfectly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What are you waiting for? Go try it on."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava pushed Alexander towards the fitting room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander chuckled, unable to resist glancing at Ava's ample bosom, which was bouncing enticingly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava didn't mind Alexander's bold gaze. Instead, she puffed out her chest a little more.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You pervert. Hurry up and change!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She picked up the clothes she had chosen and tossed them to Alexander.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Grinning, Alexander said, "Are you going to watch me change?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What? You're a grown man. What's there to be afraid of? It's not like you're stripping completely. Even if you did, I wouldn't be scared."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava urged him impatiently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Alright, alright, I'm changing now! If you're not afraid, why should I be?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander didn't hesitate and started taking off his clothes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was summer, so Alexander quickly stripped down to his underwear, revealing a tall, well-built physique. Ava licked her lips, impressed by his muscular, toned body.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Not bad, you've got a great body. Let me feel it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava couldn't resist touching Alexander's chiseled abs.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander felt a surge of excitement and had a typical reaction.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He hurriedly started putting on the pants Ava had picked out, not bothering to hide the prominent bulge in his pants.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava had an eye for fashion, and the outfit she selected was not only stylish but also fit Alexander perfectly, almost like it was tailor-made.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Huh! It won't zip up..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander paused, perplexed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He had tried to zip up too quickly, and it got stuck.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The zipper only went halfway up, leaving a noticeable bulge in the middle.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander felt a bit awkward.</p><div class="pagination">
