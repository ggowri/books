Facing Alexander Hawthorne's strength, they had no choice but to fight with everything they had.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The spiked hammer swung by the bald man moved at lightning speed, leaving a blurred trail in the air, menacing as ever!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To Alexander, however, it was nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're doomed!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a roar, Alexander unleashed the Force, a thunderous sound reverberating in the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The bald man shuddered, his speed faltering immediately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Taking advantage of the moment, Alexander struck, grabbing the bald man's wrist and twisting it violently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Crack!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The bald man's right hand twisted into a terrible shape, and the hammer fell heavily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before it could hit the floor, Alexander seized it, bringing it down hard onto the bald man's forehead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Crack!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The bald man's skull caved in, collapsing like a lifeless snake onto the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's speed with the hammer was unfathomable. The other Shadow Warriors could barely register his movements.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One of the Shadow Warriors screamed, clutching his bloody face. His nose had met the spiked hammer and was now ruined.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Another shriek followed, accompanied by the sickening sound of shattered kneecaps.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Two Shadow Warriors lay on the ground, writhing in agony, their legs obliterated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only one Shadow Warrior remained, trembling with a heavy iron chain in hand, standing frozen in fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smirked and advanced like a lightning bolt, kicking the Shadow Warrior into the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blood spurted from every orifice as his chest caved in, bones shattered to pieces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The basement fell silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both Schroder's men and the remaining Shadow Warriors were like straw before Alexander was effortlessly dispatched.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the end, only Schroder cowered in the corner, shivering.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though he had faced the horrors of the battlefield, his fighting spirit was completely crushed by Alexander's terrifying power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Alexander approached, Schroder was paralyzed with fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not only was Alexander glaring coldly at him, but Augusta and the others also looked at him with the utmost disdain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What a worthless general!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marvin </span><span>spat</span><span> contemptuously at Schroder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You insulted me? I'll kill you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unable to withstand the pressure, Schroder frantically pulled out a gun to shoot Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Snap!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sound of breaking bones echoed as Augusta disarmed him, snapping his hand with the gun.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Schroder screamed in agony, his face pale as a ghost.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Andrew, who had just been rescued, shouted desperately. "Stop! Alexander, what do you think you're doing? You dare lay a hand on the general? Let him go!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he scolded Alexander, he turned to plead with Schroder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"General, Alexander isn't one of us. You can punish him, but please don't cause trouble for the Fairfax family."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Jane likes you a lot. Please let us go, and I assure you that Jane will serve you wholeheartedly."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone was left speechless. The old fool was not only incredibly foolish but also utterly shameless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane intervened. "Dad, shut up and stop embarrassing us."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Andrew shot her a furious glare. "What do you know? Alexander is disrespecting the general. This is a huge offense!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander could only shake his head, finding it best to avoid such shameless and profoundly stupid people.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Augusta and the others were equally dumbfounded, having never seen such a ridiculous old man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander waved his hand. "If you won't appreciate it, then into the cell you go."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marvin, unable to contain himself any longer, grabbed Andrew by the throat, shoving him and Belinda into the prison.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, Augusta whispered to Alexander. "Boss, how should we handle Schroder? If we don't deal with him properly, it could lead to big trouble."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing this, Schroder burst into arrogant laughter. "You're too afraid to lay a finger on me! Smart ones will let me go, or if I raise a fuss, you'll all be in deep trouble."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you don't get rid of the root, the trouble will just sprout up again!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander waved his hand, turning to leave with determined strides.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Schroder trembled in fear. "What do you mean? Do you dare to kill me in public?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, distant sirens began to wail, growing closer.</span></p><div class="pagination">
