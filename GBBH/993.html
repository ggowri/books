How could he have the ability to summon so many military helicopters?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Asher gritted his teeth, his expression becoming increasingly grim.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The next moment, the roar of car engines echoed, growing louder as it approached rapidly yet steadily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A fleet of brand-new black Cadillacs sped into view, their movement deliberate and measured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A long procession of cars appeared one after another, like an endless black serpent stretching across the horizon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Each car's hood was adorned with an elegant chrysanthemum wreath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It made it clear that these vehicles were part of a memorial service.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The solemn atmosphere intensified, combining the black helicopters above with the seemingly endless Cadillacs, leaving everyone breathless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Asher's eyes widened in disbelief, his face contorted with anger and fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Suddenly, Ashley clapped her hands and cheered, "Daddy! That's my daddy!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>From an extended, bulletproof Cadillac, Alexander stepped out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He was dressed in a crisp white shirt, a black suit, and a black tie, holding a bouquet of pale-yellow chrysanthemums.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander's eyes glistened with unshed tears as he gazed at the tombstone, his expression filled with grief and longing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Carrying the flowers, he walked forward slowly, exuding the commanding presence of a king towering above all others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Behind him, Gavin, Gale, Quentin, the governor, and several other dignified, white-haired elders arrived, surrounded by numerous bodyguards.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Asher was dumbfounded, his mind buzzing. He had never imagined Alexander wielded such power, capable of summoning so many people, including these influential figures.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Several of these elders were among the most elite in the empire, far surpassing the Vance family's status.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Any one of them could effortlessly overshadow the Vance family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Asher counted carefully and found that there were five such figures, including Gavin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Cold sweat poured down Asher's back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It wasn't just Asher who was stunned, Axel's face turned pale, his expression dark and grim.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Lily, Ann, and the other relatives rubbed their eyes in disbelief at the scene before them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Alexander, what are you planning to do?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Asher swallowed hard, finally beginning to regret provoking Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Meanwhile, Lily and the others couldn't hold back their tears, their eyes brimming as tears streamed down their faces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In a daze, Alexander carried the chrysanthemums to the tombstone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Oliver subconsciously took a few steps back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He had long known Alexander's abilities were extraordinary and that Gavin would support him. But this display of power stunned even him, the well-seasoned police commissioner.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing Oliver retreat, the rest of the officers hurriedly distanced themselves, panic written all over their faces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They had been nervous from the start, fearing the consequences if the commissioner acted against Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>By now, dozens of helicopters had landed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>From the helicopters and Cadillacs emerged hundreds of fully armed elite soldiers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Their weapons were state-of-the-art, and their presence exuded a deadly aura that made it clear they could easily overpower the Vance family's guards.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The scene fell into dead silence. The only sound was the heavy breathing of the Vance family's men.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone's gaze was fixed on Alexander, but no one dared to point a gun at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander's cold gaze fell on Asher as he spoke, each word sharp and deliberate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He said, "You all need to bow in front of my mother's tombstone and apologize!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Otherwise, you will all die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The chilling words seemed to freeze the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Asher swallowed hard, trying to steady himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Alexander, I also have men and guns! Do you think having more people makes you invincible? If you dare touch us, you'll face the full force of the law!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Hahaha..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander burst into laughter as though he had just heard the most ridiculous joke in the world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Asher, are you scared now? Talking to me about the law?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Stop bluffing, Alexander!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Asher shouted, his bravado faltering.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"West Cemetery is now owned by the Vance family. We have every right to remodel it. What can you do about it?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Bringing some people here to intimidate us? Even with Mr. Gavin Lawson supporting you, the Vance family won't be scared!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Axel snorted in agreement and said, "My grandson is right. The Vance family doesn't back down so easily!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
