  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander glanced back and saw seven or eight men in strange clothes with colorful hair. They were obviously hooligans collecting protection fees.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as they arrived, the bustling street became chaotic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In every store, people obediently handed the money to them. No one dared to resist or call the police.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because this was </span><span>Tijuanea</span><span>, calling the police may not necessarily bring them protection, but it would definitely lead them to severe retaliation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander frowned. "What disgusting guys!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brittany comforted him softly. "Forget it. This is Tijuana, after all. It's lawless."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wesley, I'm sorry. My business has not been good this month, and I haven't made much money. And my wife is still in the hospital and needs a lot of medical expenses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Could you please give me a month's exemption?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>An elderly man with gray hair trembled and begged those hooligans.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Next to him was his daughter, a girl of about seventeen or eighteen years old. She was </span><span>pure and pretty, and her big, watery eyes betrayed her anger and fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They pushed a small cart with some simple food on it, such as sandwiches, milk, eggs, and the like.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Obviously, they didn't make much money selling low-end simple meals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Several hooligans had surrounded them aggressively.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were many onlookers, but none of them dared to stand up for the father and daughter. Despite their sullen faces, no one said a word.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The leader of the hooligans, Wesley Moreau, had dyed his hair green, wore a skull necklace around his neck, and had tattoos covering half of his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You don't have money, right? Stop selling food here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wesley kicked the cart fiercely, causing most of the food and milk to fall to the ground in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The father and daughter hurriedly picked them up, almost crying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wesley cursed while stepping on several sandwiches.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wesley, please. I only make a few dozen dollars a day, but you want me to pay 500 dollars a month. I really can't afford it..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Speaking of this, the elderly man burst into tears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Someone nearby couldn't stand it any longer and advised, "Why not exempt him from the fee this time? He's so old, and his wife is sick. He really can't make much money selling such simple meals."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah. Don't take it too far!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Many people began to speak out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shut up! Any objections? Come out!" Wesley roared and drew his sword with a ferocious expression, his green hair flying as if he were a demon from hell.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone fell silent with fright.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Annoying these hooligans could result in them being killed and their stores being burned down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dad, stop begging them. We won't sell it. Let's go home."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The girl persuaded her father.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wesley took a closer look at her and became excited. His lustful gaze swept over her ample breasts and round, full buttocks, and he could not help licking his lips.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He smiled sinisterly, "Hey, it's not that I don't have sympathy. So many people are watching. If I don't let you pay today, what if others refuse to give the money?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The elderly man pleaded pitifully, "Wesley, could you please give us a month's grace? I will definitely give it to you next month after making some money. My wife still needs money to save her life. Could you have pity on us?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wesley ignored him and kept sizing his daughter up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is this your daughter?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The elderly man froze and then nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He gazed expectantly at Wesley, thinking that he might soften and agree to their request.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wesley winked at his men, and they immediately showed obscene smiles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander, who had been paying attention to the situation here, frowned at once.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The elderly man is really stupid. It's obvious that they have bad intentions."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brittany also realized that those hooligans coveted the girl, and she couldn't help but feel sympathy for the father and daughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They are pitiful. How about we help them?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander nodded. "Leave everything to me. Sit back and watch."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brittany glanced at him, feeling joyful and close to him and believing that he was a compassionate man.</span></p><div class="pagination">
