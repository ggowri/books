  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander heard the whistling of a blade behind him. He turned around and seized Zamir by the arm. "You're really asking for it, kid! I'm going to kill you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zamir burst into tears, struggling against Alexander. "You damn devil!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a bright and cheerful smile, Alexander shoved Zamir onto the bed. "Congratulations! You've passed the test."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tears streaming down his face, Zamir looked up at Alexander in disbelief. "Are you out of your mind?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>An hour later, Alexander had extracted all the details about Walgus Church from Zamir. He explained why he was there and mentioned that officials from the Darwin Court were on their way. Zamir was overjoyed, dancing in delight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Three years prior, a group of Risunese had come to the church. They initially claimed they would live there permanently but later lured Raylan with money and women.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Raylan, whose senses were dulled by indulgence, befriended the Risunese and imprisoned any priest who opposed him in a cave on the back hill.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though Zamir was Raylan's closest disciple, he was also confined and not allowed to leave the church.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Consequently, Walgus Church became a secret base for the Risunese cult, where women, gold, and silver were frequently transported.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Many of these women had been abducted from neighboring states before being sold or sent to serve in the army in Risun.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander sighed and patted Zamir on the shoulder. "Zamir, you can endure what others can't. You're incredible."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, Zamir was just a 10-year-old child who had endured significant pressure for too long. At that moment, revealing his true feelings to Alexander filled him with excitement and happiness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He shook Alexander's arm. "Aren't you hurt? Why aren't you taking your medicine? The Docpirin was prepared by Mr. Glozier using a thousand-year-old herb along with other precious ingredients. Mr. Glozier later presented it to Arturo."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander replied slowly, "My injuries aren't serious. Go check on Arturo. If they've rested, let me know. Be careful."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zamir nodded, pushed the door, and headed to Raylan's room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>About two hours later, growing impatient, Alexander was relieved when Zamir burst through the door, beaming with excitement. "They're all drunk!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Great. Take me to the dungeon where they're holding those women," Alexander urged, quickly following Zamir down to the dungeon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the firewood room behind Walgus Church, two Risunese stood guard at the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander and Zamir swaggered over to the woodshed. Zamir stepped forward, saying, "He's the envoy. Open the door."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two Risunese nodded and bowed, retrieving a key to unlock the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Next to a pile of firewood, a small wooden panel with a ring caught their attention. One of the Risunese lifted the ring, revealing a hidden entrance below.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As one Risunese lit a lantern, Alexander took it and led Zamir down the stone steps. The interior wasn't too dark, with torches illuminating the walls at regular intervals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The passage was long and narrow, lined with small stone chambers on either side, each draped with cloth curtains marked with numbers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Some rooms were silent, while others echoed with haunting sounds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander casually lifted a curtain to peek inside one of the chambers, which was very small&mdash;barely enough room for a narrow bed and a small wooden table. A lamp flickered on the table. In the soft glow, a naked young woman knelt on the bed, shackled with iron cuffs on her hands and feet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her plump breasts sagged slightly, accentuating their size, and her backside swayed gently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A surge of heat rushed through Alexander's lower abdomen, and he coughed awkwardly, asking, "Excuse me..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing the voice, the woman looked up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that instant, Alexander froze in shock; all filthy ideas vanished. What kind of eyes were those? Blank, empty, desperate, and devoid of life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, the woman appeared to lose herself, a silly grin plastered on her face, drool pooling at her lips as she murmured, "Come on."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had completely lost her mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clenching his fists, Alexander gently lowered the curtain, suppressing the fury boiling within him as he continued to follow Zamir to the end of the passage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the passage's end stood a stone door beside which a Risunese with a sword stood guard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Zamir approached and whispered something to him. The Risunese bowed and unlocked the stone door with a key.</span></p><div class="pagination">
