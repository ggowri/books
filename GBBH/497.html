  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul's hands were strangely twisted and completely useless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From now on, it would be difficult for him to even take care of himself, let alone hold a scalpel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The others were so scared. Alexander crippled Paul's hands right away, so he must be a ruthless person.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul lay on the ground, wailing and threatening, "You will die... The Red Umbrella Group will not let you go. You and your daughter will die..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shut up!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander stepped on his right knee and crushed it hard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His knee couldn't bear the huge pressure and exploded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, Paul's entire leg swelled up like an elephant's leg. Such a serious injury could not be cured even by the most skilled orthopedic surgeon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You might as well just use a wheelchair."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's tone was offish, and he crushed Paul's other knee as well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul wailed miserably and then fainted completely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From now on, all his limbs were disabled, and he could only be a useless person for the rest of his life, repenting for what he did today.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The other members of the Red Umbrella Group were caught and pinned to the ground by Marvin and others, who followed closely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander came to the operating table and looked at his daughter's thin and pale face. The anger in his pace slowly disappeared, replaced by sadness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm sorry, Ashley. I'm back late!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander choked with sobs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ashley was still in a coma, motionless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He used the Force Sense to carefully examine the condition inside her body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The results were not optimistic. Ashley's cells seemed to be activated and evolving at a high speed in an unknown direction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This kind of evolution was uncontrollable, so her cells were dying in large numbers, and the speed of cell regeneration could not keep up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it continued, Ashley would die of multiple organ failure within three days.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander quickly mobilized all the Forces and performed Force healing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The surging Force penetrated Ashley's body and finally temporarily suppressed the self-destruction of the cells, but it still failed to fundamentally solve the problem.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unless he could get this genetic medicine and conduct more research, he could find a solution.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Half an hour later, Alexander slowly withdrew his hand, his whole body soaked with sweat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After his emergency treatment, Ashley's condition was relieved and would not worsen for at least a week.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, he turned and looked at Yohan and others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you, Mr. Young. You are a kind doctor!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander patted his shoulder with a look of gratitude in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yohan was so frightened that he shivered and waved his hands repeatedly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, no, no, this is what anyone with a conscience would do, and I couldn't stop them. Fortunately, you arrived in time. Alas..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander looked at Alice and said, "Make the arrangements. I want Mr. Young to take over Paul's position and become the director of surgery of the hospital from today onwards."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What!?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yohan was shocked and hadn't figured out who Alexander was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Several medical staff nearby curled their lips in disdain, obviously not believing what Alexander said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With his current connections and financial strength in </span><span>Loscity</span><span>, it would only take a matter of words to make Yohan the director of surgery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Immediately, Alice went to the corridor outside to make a phone call. Just a few minutes later, Yohan received a call from the hospital director, Charlie Neal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dr. Neal, I'm Yohan, do you have any instructions??" Yohan asked cautiously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the other end of the phone, Charlie smiled enthusiastically and said, "Yohan, from now on, you are the director of surgery of our hospital. You must not let everyone down!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What? Are you really going to let me be the director?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yohan couldn't believe that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Charlie, who was usually serious, became particularly amiable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course, it's true. It was Mr. Hawthorne who recommended you, and he donated 50 million dollars to our hospital. You can definitely be a good director. Our hospital needs doctors like you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He gave instructions on the phone for a long time before hanging up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yohan was extremely happy and kept thanking Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you, thank you, Mr. Hawthorne!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He now understood that the man in front of him was definitely an important figure, and a single word from him could change his fate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander said casually, "You're welcome, and this is what you deserve."</span></p><div class="pagination">
