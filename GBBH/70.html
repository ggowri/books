  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The reckless decision to dive headfirst into danger was hard for Anne to fathom.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She even considered packing her bags and getting her passport ready, just in case Alexander found himself in hot water. If anything happened to him, she'd need a quick escape out of the country.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Ugh!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With a deep sigh, Anne realized that if Alexander were killed, no distance would be far enough to escape the ensuing fallout.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After hanging up, she hurried off to gather her team.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">*****</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At the Brilliant Estate by the Manhadion coast, the scenery was stunning, and the air was crisp and fresh. A gentle sea breeze added to the pleasant atmosphere.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">By the time Alexander arrived, the place was buzzing with activity, filled with guests and the sound of laughter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Theodore, the only son of Sebastian, the president of the Brilliant Group, was throwing this lavish dinner party, and everyone felt obliged to show up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Holding a torn invitation in his hand, Alexander walked through the security checkpoint, feeling the curious stares of the guards.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Meanwhile, Andrew and his daughter Jane arrived at the venue.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Jane, can you believe we're actually here? The entire upper crust of Loscity is in attendance!" Andrew exclaimed, his face lighting up with excitement.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jane rolled her eyes. "Dad, you really need to stop downplaying yourself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'm Mr. Tate's woman now, and he's promised to elevate the Fairfax family to new heights in Loscity."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Andrew beamed with pride. "This is what they call a blessing in disguise.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"With Alexander and Ryan out of the picture, the Fairfax family has a brighter future ahead.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Do you think Alexander will show up with Ava?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jane said, a smirk on her face, "I doubt they'll dare to come. Mr. Tate is hosting this dinner to take down the Saint Group.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Sure, they're all under the same Godfather, but the chairman of the Brilliant Group is Guzman, the Godfather's son. What can the Saint Group possibly do to compete with that?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Andrew rubbed his hands together, excitement bubbling over. "What does Mr. Tate want us to do?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jane narrowed her eyes, a cold smile creeping onto her face. "Mr. Tate said there would come a time when I'd be of use. We'll find out soon enough.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Just thinking about that Alexander and Ava couple makes my blood boil! Once the Saint Group falls apart, I can't wait to see them brought low."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jane fumed, still seething with anger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At that moment, a tattooed man with brown skin spotted Alexander entering the venue and quickly leaned in to whisper to Theodore, "Mr. Tate, Alexander's here!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Theodore paused, disbelief etched on his face. "He dares to show up? How many people did he bring?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The man's expression was a mix of surprise and concern. "I only saw him come in alone."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Alone? That's just foolish. I was planning to sign alliances with everyone tonight and then take down him and the Saint Group. Looks like he's delivered himself right to my doorstep." Theodore chuckled, a sinister glint in his eye.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Should I go kill him now?" the tattooed man asked, his scorpion tattoo writhing as he spoke.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Theodore shook his head. "Now that he's here, he's trapped. I want to humiliate him first and show him that a peasant is still a peasant."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The tattooed man nodded, then said, "Mr. Tate, Jacob Mitchell has gone missing, and Joseph was burned to ashes. Do you think this is related to Alexander?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Theodore sneered dismissively, saying, "Don't worry. It's definitely Ava's doing. Alexander is just a softie living off women. Jacob may have skills, but he's no match for you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The tattooed man fell silent, but unease gnawed at him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After all, Jacob's knife skills were top-notch; he'd gone to great lengths to have it custom-made by a master craftsman.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The day Theodore sent Jacob to assassinate Alexander, both the man and his knife vanished without a trace&mdash;an eerie turn of events.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mr. Hawthorne? What brings you here?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A familiar voice broke through Alexander's thoughts.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He turned to see Oscar standing there, a look of surprise on his face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Sir Stewart, you're here, too?" Alexander remarked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Oscar quickly explained, "I just wanted to see what Theodore was up to. My alliance with the Saint Group is rock-solid."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander chuckled. "Sir Stewart, no need to be so nervous. I don't mind."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After apologizing on Vincent's behalf, Oscar took a seat next to Alexander.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mr. Hawthorne, since Ms. Blackburn isn't here, maybe you should leave now."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander raised an eyebrow. "Why on earth should I leave?"</p><div class="pagination">
