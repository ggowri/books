  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Sean didn't even glance at Marvin, speaking in a harsh tone, "No need to introduce your bodyguard; I'm not interested! Don't think we'll just let it go because you took Devil Island.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'm not pleased about this. You need to hand over Devil Island!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Sean glared at Alexander, his eyes filled with lethal intent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ezra's gaze turned sharp, a fierce aura targeting Alexander, ready to strike at any moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The atmosphere at the scene seemed to freeze, a dead silence settling over the crowd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone sensed the tension between them, and no one dared to speak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>To openly confront the Dragon Gang, this guy had to be impressive. Was he a key figure in the Sakra Society?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Some clever onlookers speculated about Alexander's identity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander remained composed, asking Norma calmly, "Ms. Walsh, is this how the Walsh family welcomes guests? You invited me, didn't you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Norma's brows furrowed, and she shot Sean an annoyed look before smiling at Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The Walsh family is known for our hospitality. Since I invited you, I'll ensure your safety, Mr. Hawthorne. Please, come in!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She ignored Sean and led Alexander toward her car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Hmph!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Sean's expression darkened, and he looked like he was about to explode.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander suddenly turned and shot Sean a fierce glare.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His eyes were like the night, seemingly capable of devouring a person's soul.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Sean felt a sudden chill in his heart, as if all his secrets had been laid bare by Alexander's stare.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A wave of cold radiated from within him, spreading throughout his body, leaving his palms and soles drenched in sweat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thankfully, Alexander only glanced at him before getting into Norma's car and leaving.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Are you all right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ezra noticed Sean had gone still, his face pale. Realizing the gravity of the situation, he hurried to support him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Huff, huff..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Sean was gasping for air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'm fine... What's with that guy's eyes? It's like they could kill!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"That wretched Norma. Tell Benjamin to stop stalling and bring down her casino. Make her lose everything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Then I'll have a shot at taking over as leader!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ezra momentarily pondered and said, "Mr. Walsh, we need a backup plan. Let the hitman take action and kill both Norma and Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Then we'll spread the word that Norma and Alexander had a dispute over Devil Island and ended up taking each other out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This way, the Dragon Gang and Devil Island will be yours, and the entire Walsh family fortune will be under your control."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Sean's excitement flared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Yes! I am the true leader of the Walsh family. The Dragon Gang and everything it owns should be mine."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Understood, Mr. Walsh. I'll take care of it right away."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ezra bowed his head respectfully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Norma led Alexander to a bustling, opulent casino.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The place was lavishly decorated, with packed gambling halls buzzing with excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This is one of our major sources of income, a top-ranked casino worldwide that brings us billions in annual profit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"And of course, it's under my sole control!" Norma's eyes gleamed with pride and power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A slight blush spread across Norma's beautiful face, her eyes sparkling with the glow of authority.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander wasn't sure why Norma had brought him here, but he scanned the hall, taking in the entire scene.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>There were over a hundred gambling tables, surrounded by at least a thousand people, some standing and others seated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Many attractive women moved through the crowd, offering services.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The dealers at the tables were young and attractive, dressed provocatively as they dealt cards and collected chips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This casino was impressive, rivaling even Kaylon's establishments.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Norma, dressed in a high-slit dress, swayed her hips as she walked ahead, occasionally casting flirtatious glances back at Alexander with a seductive smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Now that Sean was out of the picture, Norma was even more welcoming to Alexander. "Mr. Hawthorne, what do you think of my casino?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Norma's voice was sweet and playful, as if she were teasing Alexander.</span></p><div class="pagination">
