  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn you, bitch, </span><span>you're</span><span> dead meat..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clay still refused to back down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bang! Bang!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Two more shots rang out, shattering Clay's hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy sneered, "I won't kill you, but I didn't say I wouldn't punish you. I'll take your hands and feet, leaving you just enough to breathe."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clay was in so much pain he passed out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What had started as annoyance for Alexander now turned into satisfaction; you can't show weakness to your enemies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get him out of here!" Luther commanded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clay was dragged out like a dead dog by the bodyguards.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Richard felt a bit awkward as he turned to Alexander, "Sorry about earlier. I didn't expect Clay to be such a despicable guy."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Reynolds family gathered around Alexander, chatting him up excitedly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He carried himself with the grace of a true gentleman, a far cry from Clay.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once the family learned that Alexander was the mastermind behind the magic powder, their excitement skyrocketed, praising Nancy's keen eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, Alexander and Nancy became the center of attention, leaving Sophie feeling sidelined and a bit forlorn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clara looked on with envy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, darling, if you could find a guy like Alexander, I'd be more than satisfied," Clara said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sophie rolled her eyes, "How about we both marry him?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You! What a silly girl, that's just shameless."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clara reached to swat her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom, I was just joking. No need to get so worked up."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sophie laughed, dodging, but her gaze lingered on Alexander with a glint of something more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Two hours later, Alexander left the Reynolds mansion, where Nancy stayed to celebrate her grandfather's birthday.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he arrived at the hotel, a man in a black robe, flanked by several others, surrounded him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then they wheeled out a chair and seated in it was none other than Clay, now incapacitated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Heh..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smirked; he had suspected the City of Sorcery would have more men in Kingsdon than just Clay.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clay was wrapped in bandages, stained with blood, and reeking of medication.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander knew Clay wouldn't let it go after Nancy took him down, but he felt no fear&mdash;in fact, he welcomed their arrival.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man in the black robe strode towards Alexander, thin and imposing, leaning on a dark cane. His veins bulged as he gripped it, fingers like claws.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A fierce aura radiated from </span><span>him,</span><span> his cold gaze capable of making even the bravest shiver.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clay growled, "Mr. Williams, it's him, Alexander!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smiled indifferently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Clay, you're a nobody now, and yet you still want to drag others into your mess. I don't even know how to respond."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clay gritted his teeth, "Heh, don't think you're invincible. Mr. Williams is our contact in Kingsdon; he'll help me get revenge!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm not only going to make you suffer; I want Nancy and her whole family gone. I'll hang you up and make Nancy kneel and lick my toes while you watch..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clay </span><span>raved,</span><span> his madness evident from the shock of his condition.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander scoffed, "You don't know that I've already set a trap, do you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What trap? Don't try to scare me, I'm not afraid of you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clay's face turned pale.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't believe me? Let's test it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander snapped his fingers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ow! Ah... what... my head hurts..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clay suddenly cried out, twitching violently in his chair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's happening? Mr. Williams... help me... it hurts!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone stood in shock; with just a snap of Alexander's fingers, Clay was writhing in agony&mdash;too bizarre to comprehend.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In truth, Alexander had left a trace of the Force within Clay when he dealt with him, ready to make his life a nightmare at any moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Patrick was taken aback, rushing to examine Clay.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He muttered incantations and pulled out several odd items, using five or six different spells before he could relieve Clay's pain, albeit slightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clay was pale as a ghost, weakly pleading, "Mr. Williams, kill him! If you kill him, I swear I'll be fine."</span></p><div class="pagination">
