Get ready to transfer the shares of the Red Umbrella Group, and I'll make sure Alexander is completely destroyed!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Frederick's cold, piercing gaze was fixed on Felix, closely watching his reaction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, I understand. I'll do exactly as </span><span>promised</span><span>."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix bowed deeply without hesitation, not daring to look up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Good, very good."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Felix's respectful attitude, Frederick nodded with satisfaction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As long as he could leverage Felix to gain control over the Red Umbrella Group and obtain Alexander's magic powder formula, the Morris family would immediately gain an advantage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Weston, who had been standing nearby, let out a smug laugh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Felix, I thought you were so powerful, but here you are, bowing down."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix kept his head down, appearing bashful, but no one noticed the menacing expression on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was swallowing his pride, letting Frederick and Alexander fight it out so he could clean up the aftermath and come out the true victor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ideally, he'd turn every member of the Morris family into a nutrient serum to rapidly increase his own power!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Frederick, with his immense power, had no idea what Felix was actually plotting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he knew Felix had already turned several strong fighters into nutrient serum, he'd surely act immediately to eliminate the threat before it grew.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a lavish bedroom, Alexander held Nancy close, kissing her while discussing plans to visit her home the next day.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tomorrow was Nancy's grandfather's birthday, and Clay might attend. Alexander planned to put an end to Nancy's forced marriage situation once and for all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy moaned, clinging tightly to Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While Alexander enjoyed himself, he glanced toward the doorway and saw Rosalia sneaking a look again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed like Rosalia had a habit of sneaking peeks. Alexander chuckled. Maybe it was time to invite her in for some fun with the two of them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander craved a quick power boost. Besides leveling up his lightsaber to Level 2, accelerating his Force was critical.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The more beautiful women Alexander was around, the faster his Force would grow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both Nancy and Rosalia were exquisite beauties.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosalia was especially obedient; even if she was shy, she wouldn't object.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy, already his woman, would be less likely to resist, so Alexander was confident it would work out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry, I just hope Clay shows up tomorrow. I'll take care of him once and for </span><span>all!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander reassured her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Mmm</span><span>, thank you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy responded passionately, offering him her full, soft chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander kissed her deeply.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Mmm</span><span>, you smell so good, and there's a little sweetness. I like it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah, you're talking nonsense! I don't even have milk, so how could it be sweet?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy blushed with embarrassment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Heh, heh. Just wait till I get you pregnant. You'll have milk then."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander skillfully stripped her bare.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He admired her ample chest with great satisfaction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Big, sweet, and so perky&mdash;absolutely perfect!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To be honest, Nancy's chest was remarkable, more attractive than ninety percent of women's.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Alexander heard Rosalia outside, breathing heavily as she reached into her top, rubbing herself vigorously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander pinned Nancy down on the bed, then suddenly opened the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop peeking. If you want to watch, come in."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosalia jumped in surprise, then happily wrapped her arms around Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After closing the door, Rosalia eagerly looked Nancy up and down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy was so embarrassed that she couldn't even lift her head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander chuckled. "Just don't scare anyone, alright?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes. I'll behave perfectly," Rosalia replied without hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosalia began undressing without a second thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her fair, voluptuous body was fully revealed: full, perky chest, slender waist, round hips, and long, elegant legs. Every bit was as stunning as Nancy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy stared in shock, dazedly asking, "W-What... what's happening?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander stroked Nancy's soft hips, smiling as he reassured her, "Don't be scared. She's not a man."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosalia had already moved closer, gently and skillfully touching Nancy, caressing and kissing as she went.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moments before, it had only been Alexander's mouth and hands, but now there were two mouths and four hands, all exploring Nancy's most sensitive spots, gliding, stroking, and kneading...</span></p><div class="pagination">
