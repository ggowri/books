  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The faces of the other Federer family executives turned dark.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One was the Federer family's top fighter, and the other controlled their finances; with both of them around, the Federer family was finished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Very well, from now on, you two need to cooperate and discuss the Federer family's affairs together, only coming to me for very important matters."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smiled as he instructed them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Miguel and Edward were immediately filled with enthusiasm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you, Mr. Hawthorne! Thank you, Mr. Hawthorne!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We will certainly dedicate ourselves completely until the end."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Alexander remembered the facial mask.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Edward, send me the information on the facial mask, and quickly help me customize </span><span>one."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This facial mask was so realistic that it was the result of massive investment by the Federer family, but Edward showed no hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay, but this mask is made with great precision and will take five days from molding to completion."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Five days? Alright, as soon as possible."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander nodded. With this mask, he could slip into Treasure Island without anyone knowing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he was leaving, Alexander looked at the other Federer family members and coldly said, "Remember my words: don't bring trouble upon yourselves. If it comes to that, don't come to me for help."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Federer family members stared blankly at Alexander's retreating figure, unable to utter a word.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It felt like a nightmare, but the corpses scattered throughout the hall and the blood pooling on the floor reminded them that this was all too real.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one in </span><span>Loscity</span><span> knew that overnight, the Federer family, led by the four great families, had undergone a drastic change.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Fraternity and the Federer family were both secretly controlled by Alexander, rapidly expanding the hard power of the Ultimate Alliance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Coupled with the Saint Group, Alexander felt more at ease about leaving </span><span>Loscity</span><span> for Treasure Island.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By the time Alexander returned to his villa in </span><span>Bevery</span><span> Hills, it was fully light outside, and a delivery person had just dropped off a package.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To his surprise, it was a subpoena from the court.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The plaintiff, Jane, was suing him for defrauding the Fairfax family out of forty million, demanding not only the thirty million he owed but also an additional fifty million in damages.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was truly speechless; being a good person was impossible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it hadn't been for Ashley, he wouldn't have bothered with this matter at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After helping the Fairfax family recover ten million, he ended up being sued.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fuming, Alexander returned home to find Ava still asleep, deep in slumber.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her alluring body lay sideways, curvaceous and incredibly sexy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unable to resist, Alexander leaned in and buried his face between her seemingly explosive curves, soft and smooth&mdash;pure paradise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You naughty boy, what do you want to do this time..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava let out a soft hum without opening her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander felt a surge of anger with no outlet, unable to resist kissing her as he pressed her down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava immediately became light-headed, and as she matched Alexander's tongue movements, the electric sensation made her completely lose herself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You didn't wear a condom. What if I get pregnant?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She moaned sweetly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander reassured her. "Don't worry, I know how to control myself. You won't get pregnant unless you want a baby."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava shook her head, her face flushed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No! We're not married yet. We can't have kids; we're not ready."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander chuckled, all his anger transforming into desire as he held Ava close.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava took the initiative to straddle Alexander's lap, becoming a brave knight charging forward...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a while, Ava lay shivering on Alexander, completely out of energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander carried her into the bathroom and they enjoyed a relaxing bath together.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Alexander was in a great mood; intimacy between them truly relaxed his body and mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He picked up that summons again, sneering as he tore it to shreds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Beep!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His phone buzzed; it was Miguel sending over Gary's assets along with a series of transfer documents.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Two mansions in </span><span>Bevery</span><span> Hills, three luxury apartments in the city center, and four companies, totaling over five hundred million dollars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander thought for a moment but didn't tell Alice or Ava about the lawsuit against Jane.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The legal department at the Saint Group definitely had the best lawyers, but Alexander wasn't planning to rely on them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, these assets were one of his trump cards, and he needed someone to manage them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander remembered there was a high-end law firm nearby, so he straightened his clothes and headed that way.</span></p><div class="pagination">
