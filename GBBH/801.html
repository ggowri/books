  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>These eight men were her bodyguards, all of whom had undergone extremely rigorous training and possessed exceptional skills.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Any of them could easily handle four or five ordinary people.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Given that there were eight of them against one, Zora was brimming with confidence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander sneered, "You think you can take me down with these worthless trash? That's the biggest joke I've ever heard."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He reached out with lightning speed and grabbed two of the bodyguards by their throats.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The crisp sound of bones breaking echoed through the air as Alexander snapped the necks of the two bodyguards.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Their bodies were still twitching, but they were already corpses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander casually tossed the two corpses onto the carpet as if discarding garbage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"How dare you?" Zora screamed in panic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She never imagined that Alexander would dare to strike first and that he could kill two of her subordinates with a single move. It was truly terrifying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What are you waiting for? Get him!" Zora shouted urgently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Two bodyguards at the back were about to draw their guns, but Alexander appeared in front of them. He grabbed their heads and smashed them together.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Their heads were crushed like smashed watermelons, blood spurting out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Quick! Grab him!" Zora shouted again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The remaining four bodyguards, driven by fear, spread their arms wide and rushed at Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Get out of my way!" Alexander bellowed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He unleashed the Force, creating a gust of wind that sent the four bodyguards flying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The sounds of collisions mixed with screams filled the entire villa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The bodyguards crashed into tables and chairs, breaking their bones and tearing their muscles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Trash!" Alexander shook his head disdainfully and then turned to Zora.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Zora was terrified, not expecting Alexander to be so formidable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It turned out that the one who had underestimated the enemy was not Alexander but her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'll kill you!" Zora shouted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She drew a small silver pistol and fired at Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The distance between them was no more than seven feet, and she heard two consecutive gunshots.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She was confident in her marksmanship. Alexander was sure to be shot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, something strange happened. The bullets only hit the air, and Alexander disappeared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was just an afterimage. Alexander's speed was incredibly fast.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander slapped Zora to the ground, and the pistol was sent flying far away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Zora clutched her burning cheek and gritted her teeth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She spat, "Alexander, I underestimated your strength, but you should think carefully. I have the backing of the Dragon Gang. You have already become an enemy of the Sakura Society. Do you want to be hunted by our Dragon Gang as well?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander scoffed, "The enemy of my enemy is my friend. I could have cooperated with the Dragon Gang, but you all are too greedy."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Zora remained defiant, threatening him. "You'd better let me go, or the Dragon Gang won't let you off. You'll be in big trouble."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander was furious. This woman was truly unreasonable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He grabbed Zora by the neck and pulled her toward him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her strapless dress was torn open, revealing her full, ample breasts, which bounced with her struggles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Zora panicked and shouted, "What are you doing? Don't touch me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander grabbed a handful of her elastic flesh and began to knead it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ah, it hurts!" Zora cried out in pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But as Alexander continued to touch her, her voice softened, and she began to pant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She said, "If you let me go, I can agree to let you fuck me once."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing that threats didn't work, she began to seduce Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander ignored her and pressed her down on the table.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He commanded, "Kneel and stay still."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Zora tried to struggle, but Alexander slapped her round, plump buttocks hard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Zora's hot body was forced onto the cold table.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The pain from her spanked bottom was burning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The combination of extreme sensations brought Zora unprecedented pleasure.</span></p><div class="pagination">
