  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Ava suppressed her dissatisfaction deep within for the sake of the overall situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now she understood that Alexander hadn't lied to her. Otherwise, all that was going on before her eyes was inexplicable.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just now, he needed her to support him when walking, but after she gave him a blow job, he regained his strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Alexander kneaded Ava's buttocks and chuckled, "I'm still recovering. Why don't you take control for a while?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She hugged him tightly and kissed him passionately on his face, lips, and neck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Honey, you can do whatever you want, and I will cooperate with you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Holding Ava with one hand, Alexander removed her dress with the other, pulling off the thin strap of her sexy thong to reveal her vagina.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As her delicate body fell downwards, he filled her completely...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Two hours later, Alexander stepped out of the ward, refreshed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sir, are you okay?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Augusta, who was the first to spot Alexander, ran over delightedly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosalia followed closely behind, her eyes betraying joy and excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander patted their shoulders and smiled, "Don't worry. I'm fine now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that time, he suddenly heard a few patients and their families muttering at the end of the corridor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I just went downstairs and the street's crawling with cops. Police cars are everywhere, trying to control some crazy situation. Something big must be going down."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah. I heard he was a lunatic who escaped from a mental hospital and killed everyone he met!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A lunatic?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's curiosity was aroused, and he approached the window and looked out at the street.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A group of police officers surrounded a middle-aged man who was running around on all fours like a mad dog.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nearby were several victims, all with blood on their faces, ducking in fear.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander frowned, sensing that something was </span><span>off</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since Yinson had restarted the Apocalypse Project, did he attempt to attack ordinary people?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the appearance of </span><span>a</span><span> lunatic didn't mean anything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come on. Let's leave the hospital."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander left the hospital with Ava and the others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On his return, at the door of the villa, he heard some dogs barking from within.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He exclaimed in surprise, "</span><span>What?</span><span>!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inside, there were Charlize and Ashley, tossing treats to the dogs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sir, h-have you recovered?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Charlize wept tears of joy at the sight of Alexander.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chuckling, he patted her shoulder, picked up Ashley, and kissed her chubby cheek.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dad, I love these dogs </span><span>so</span><span> much!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ashley hugged Alexander's neck and pointed at th</span><span>ose</span><span> black Cane Corso dogs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Charlize immediately explained, "It was arranged by Ms. Rowe. These dogs have received professional training and can enhance the defense force."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander nodded. These dogs were pretty good, each of them strong, energetic, and cute, with black eyes and smooth fur.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The dogs circled around him, wagging their tails vigorously to please him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Charlize couldn't help marveling, for these fierce dogs were very wary of strangers though very friendly to children.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, they were submissive to Alexander, and one of them even lay down with its belly exposed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander</span><span> </span><span>smiled slightly, well knowing that dogs were far more sensitive than humans. The dogs must have sensed his powerful aura, which was why they tried so hard to please him.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he entered the villa, Lynn had already prepared a hearty meal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were four dishes and one soup, and they all tasted very good. Lynn's cooking was different from Ava's and had a unique flavor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After dinner, Alexander wanted to chat with Ava, but she took Ashley to rest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He </span><span>could only go back</span><span> to his room </span><span>and plan to</span><span> invit</span><span>e</span><span> Rosalia to play games for a while.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To his surprise, the door was suddenly pushed open.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes shot up at the sight, and his breath caught in his throat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lynn walked in wearing a scanty bikini, revealing a large area of her plump and delicate body, which was incredibly attractive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smiled and sized her up with admiration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She threw her arms around his neck, purring, "My dear Alexander, Ava told me about a new spa nearby. Can you take me there? You can't get in with your injury, but you can watch me enjoy the hot springs."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Hot springs, huh? You just missed me while I was gone, didn't you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander grinned, his hand sliding down to grip her perfect ass.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The softness was something he couldn't resist.</span></p><div class="pagination">
