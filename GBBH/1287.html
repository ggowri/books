  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For the next few days, as Alexander drove, Sally rode ahead on her bicycle, wielding a machete to clear the way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With her help, things became much easier for Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under his guidance, Sally had learned to handle most mutant cats and dogs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Against ordinary zombies, she could take down dozens on her own, as long as she didn't get surrounded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Whenever they came across a grocery store or supermarket, Alexander would stop to explore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, their large off-road vehicle was packed to the brim with supplies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Flour, butter, sausages, canned goods... The car was now stuffed with essentials.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Sally's bike had two bulging backpacks strapped to the back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It should be around here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander pulled over and studied the map.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With his sharp senses and enhanced vision, he quickly spotted the entrance to an underground air-raid shelter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was hidden beneath thick bushes. There was a large iron gate, wide enough for a vehicle to pass through, measuring about 13 feet across.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A heavy iron lock hung on the door, rusted with age.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a swift swing of his sword, Alexander sliced through the lock, and the lock snapped in two, dropping to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sally rushed forward and pushed against the gate, but it didn't budge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Whoa! It's heavy!" she exclaimed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She blinked, planted her feet, and used all her strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Slowly, the gate groaned and began to move. A gust of cool air rushed out as the door creaked open.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was no foul smell, no dampness. The ventilation shafts were still working, which meant the place had plenty of oxygen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander drove the car inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After exploring for a while, they realized the air-raid shelter was enormous. Even after walking several hundred yards, they hadn't reached the end.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Some of the deeper tunnels had collapsed, blocking access to the lower levels.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The main chamber stretched hundreds of yards long, more than thirteen feet wide, and several yards high. Their voices echoed in the vast space.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They unloaded all the food from the vehicle and then set out again to raid a few nearby stores.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, one corner of the air-raid shelter was piled high with supplies. There were over a hundred sacks of flour, each weighing twenty pounds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That alone was enough to feed an adult for years.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On top of that, they had hundreds of pounds of sausages, hundreds of cans of food, plus a generous stash of chocolate, candy, and other snacks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander even found a generator, a lithium battery storage unit, and several barrels of diesel in the backyard of a grocery store.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After wiring everything up, they had working electric lights again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nearly a month had passed since the crisis started, and for the first time, Alexander had proper lighting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sally cheered, laughing and jumping like a child under the bright glow of the bulbs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The air-raid shelter was like a natural refrigerator. Their food would last a long time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, they needed a clean water source. They had collected plenty of bottled water, but for washing clothes and taking baths, they needed something more sustainable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander wasn't doing all of this for himself. He planned to leave Sally here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With her current skills and this safe hideout, he believed she would be able to live well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His own goal remained unchanged. He still wanted to find Yinson. He knew that old bastard was hiding somewhere, probably in an underground base in Kylaville or another secret location.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander had to track him down. With the pure Immortality Serum, he could develop a vaccine and stop the spread of zombies, putting an end to this nightmare.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, a deafening rumble of thunder echoed through the air-raid shelter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's raining. Get some rest. I'll make us something to eat."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sally beamed and sprinted toward their makeshift kitchen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander had gathered a full set of cooking utensils and built a simple stove out of stones. A fan, rigged with pipes leading outside, acted as a crude ventilation system.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rain poured steadily outside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Standing by the iron gate, Alexander watched as the heavy downpour blurred the world beyond.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Water streamed down the sloped entrance, forming a small, continuous creek.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes lit up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He grabbed a shovel and stepped outside. Sally, unsure of what he was up to, hurried after him.</span></p><div class="pagination">
