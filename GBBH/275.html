  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He dared to challenge Alexander in </span><span>Loscity</span><span>, completely misjudging the situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Four men in black tactical suits, exuding a formidable presence, were stationed on a </span><span>rooftop overlooking the Hansen Villa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Johnny, the General ordered us to wait here. Is Alexander really worth deploying our elite squad?" asked a man with a scorpion tattoo on his neck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Johnny, the team leader, smiled, revealing a set of white teeth. "Noah, questioning the General's orders? You're asking for trouble. Just sit tight and wait. Alexander won't escape tonight. Whether he complies with the General or not, his fate is sealed."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Noah chuckled darkly. "It's been a while since we had a mission like this. Alexander should feel honored."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Johnny laughed. "All of us going after one guy&mdash;it's almost embarrassing!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adrian, a pockmarked man, joined in. "I hope Alexander has some sense; I'd rather not get my hands dirty."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These men were seasoned veterans, each capable of handling a mission alone. Now they were teaming up to ambush a man in his twenties.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Noah asked, "Is the General really starting a company on behalf of the military? It seems fishy. Could he be using the military's name to profit in </span><span>Loscity</span><span>?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shut up!" Johnny snapped. "Noah, do you have a death wish? Meddling in the General's business? I'll report you and have you dealt with."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adrian intervened, "Johnny, don't be mad. Noah just can't keep his mouth shut. Noah, apologize already!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking embarrassed, Noah quickly apologized.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A lookout with binoculars shouted, "Johnny, Alexander's car is here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The men stood up and raised their binoculars, eager to see the rising star of </span><span>Loscity</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The three cars suddenly slowed down and stopped at a distance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Johnny muttered, "What's he doing, stopping so far from the villa?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The door of the middle car opened, and Alexander stepped out, grinning in their direction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Noah asked, "Why hasn't the General given the order yet? This is a perfect sniping spot; I could take Alexander out with one shot!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shut up! The General hasn't secured the magic powder formula yet," Johnny scolded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey! Everyone, be careful..." Adrian suddenly exclaimed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Johnny, Noah, and the others were stunned. "What happened? </span><span>Alexander's</span><span> gone? He just got out of the car and smiled at us, then vanished..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Noah rubbed his eyes, bewildered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Johnny's face turned serious. "He didn't vanish; he moved so fast that he disappeared from view. No wonder the General sent our elite squad. We've never seen anything like this&mdash;unbelievable speed and stealth! At this distance, he shouldn't have been able to spot us..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was no illusion that Alexander had exited the car, nor that he had vanished. All four men were experienced veterans; they couldn't all be mistaken.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That speed is terrifying, like a phantom... an enemy like this is truly frightening," Johnny muttered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Johnny, what now? Do we wait for the General's orders or go after Alexander?" Noah asked, anxious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Johnny sighed deeply, frowning. "Where did Alexander go? At this distance, he </span><span>couldn't have detected us, could he? This is really strange..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No! He must have spotted us!" Johnny's face turned pale. He quickly drew his gun and scanned the area.</span></p><div class="pagination">
