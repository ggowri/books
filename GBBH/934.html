  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone stood frozen in shock, the sound of gunfire silenced, and the battlefield fell into a haunting stillness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though Arthur was safely hidden inside the armored vehicle, his body was drenched in cold sweat, uncontrollable tremors wracking his frame.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That damn bastard, he's playing with me like a cat with a mouse!" he thought, seething with rage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fire! Now! If you don't want to die, kill him!" Arthur yelled, his voice breaking as veins bulged on his forehead from the force of his shouting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bang! Bang! Bang!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Countless rounds tore through the air, aiming at Alexander, but it was like chasing a shadow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had vanished, as if he had never been there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Whoosh!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A sudden flash of white light shot through the armored vehicle, narrowly missing Arthur's chest. He barely managed to suppress a gasp of terror.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hiss!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The lightsabers sliced through the armored vehicle like a hot knife through butter, cleaving it effortlessly in two.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He's out there&mdash;fire!" Arthur screamed, losing his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inside the vehicle, the crew and Mafia members outside were in complete disarray.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Some fired their guns in frantic bursts, others ran for their lives, only to fall in pools of their own blood, their bodies littering the ground like broken dolls, death blossoming around them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it!" Arthur's face contorted with rage, teetering on the edge of insanity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He never imagined that what he thought would be a sure victory would turn into his greatest mistake.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bang! Bang!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gunfire erupted again as Mafia members fired wildly at Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Alexander didn't flinch. He suddenly shot up into the air, leaving only a flash of white light in his wake.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Screams!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A few Mafia members were cleaved into pieces mid-air, their bodies falling apart like shattered toys, blood spraying everywhere.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grabbing Timothy with one hand and holding a gun to his head with the other, Arthur snarled, "Alexander, stand still! Don't move, or I'll kill him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The threat worked. Alexander appeared once more, his gaze cold and disdainful as he met Arthur's eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bang!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Arthur took the shot, but the gunfire was futile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The bullets tore through nothing but air, passing straight through Alexander's fading image.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Mafia members, still grinning, froze in shock as they realized the bullets had missed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment was fleeting, but it felt like time had stopped. A flash of white light, and then&mdash;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Several Mafia members, along with their machine gun, were split in half, their bodies falling apart in a gruesome display. Blood sprayed in every direction, turning the scene into something straight out of a nightmare.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a glowing lightsaber in his hand, Alexander smirked at Arthur, his expression one of cold amusement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Arthur's body shuddered, his face turning pale as he muttered, "Demon... you're a demon from hell!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fear gripped him like a vice, swallowing him whole.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a blur, Alexander was right in front of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Arthur tried to raise his gun, but before he could react, an intense pain shot through his arm. His right hand, along with the gun, dropped to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Aaaaah</span><span>!" Arthur screamed as he collapsed, his body wracked with agony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Timothy, bound and bruised, stood shakily, his head hung low, unsure of how to face Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's okay," Alexander said softly, offering Timothy a reassuring smile as he patted his shoulder. "Come with me to Treasure Island."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a snap of his fingers, Alexander reached out, pulling the Force from deep within Arthur.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Arthur's eyes bulged as the agony intensified.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It felt as though his insides were being torn apart by a thousand knives, his bones and organs splitting from the force of it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The pain was unbearable. Blood poured from his eyes, nose, mouth, and ears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Standing over him, Alexander looked down coldly, his voice dripping with disdain. "Don't worry, Arthur. I won't let you die quickly. Anyone who betrays me will suffer far worse than death."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Timothy watched the scene in horrified silence, his face drained of color. At that moment, he couldn't help but feel a deep, internal relief that he had never joined Arthur in his betrayal.</span></p><div class="pagination">
