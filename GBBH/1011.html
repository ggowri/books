  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Though Alexander appeared imposing, in Asher's eyes, it was as if Alexander had walked into his own grave. To Asher, he was already as good as dead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander turned his gaze toward Asher, murderous intent in his soulful eyes, a cold smile tugging at his lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Asher, you're not leaving here today. And neither is Axel. Neither of you will escape."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His words, dripping with killing intent, seemed to chill the air around them, dropping the temperature by several degrees.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Asher snorted dismissively, his voice dripping with contempt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Alexander, do you think this is still West Cemetery? Today, I'm fully prepared, and the only one who's going to die here is you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Hand over the magic powder formula, and perhaps I'll spare you some suffering.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"And as for the women around you, whether it's Ava or Betty... they're mine. They're all mine! After you're dead, I'll take good care of them. Don't worry."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A sinister laugh escaped him, his eyes gleaming with greed and desire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander shook his head. He realized that Asher still hadn't realized the danger he was in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Asher, I will kill you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Asher laughed derisively, not taking Alexander's threat seriously at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Two men, each radiating cold, murderous intent, stepped forward from behind Asher. One possessed level-two strength power, and the other, like Windwolf, was a metahuman with level-two speed power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Vance, let's stop wasting time with this guy. Let's just kill him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Alexander, I've heard you're strong, but the three of us can easily handle you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You're an idiot! Anyone who dares to insult Mr. Vance will be killed."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With his two powerful companions at his side, Windwolf regained his confidence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He had already forgotten the moment when Alexander had shattered his knife with a tiny stone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Kill him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Under Windwolf's command, the three men arranged themselves in a triangular formation, their cold eyes locking onto Alexander, ready to strike.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In their eyes, Alexander was already a dead man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Are you three serious? Do you think you can fight me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander couldn't believe how ridiculous this was. He wasn't just a level-two metahuman anymore. At his current strength, even a level-five metahuman wouldn't stand a chance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Shut up. Don't act so cocky in front of me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Asher snapped, a cruel smirk spreading across his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Take him down. I want to have some fun with his women in front of him..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before he could finish, a flash of fierce light flickered in Alexander's eyes. "Die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He made the first move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, Asher wasn't worried in the slightest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Windwolf and his two companions were already on high alert. The moment Alexander moved, they roared in unison, "Grab him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before they could even react, Windwolf shot forward like a bolt of lightning, blocking Asher's path.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The gleaming edge of a knife flashed!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Windwolf now held two knives, one in each hand, and he viciously stabbed toward Alexander's chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At the same time, his two metahuman companions attacked from either side.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>One, just as fast as Windwolf, slipped behind Alexander with a knife in hand, aiming for his back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The other, wearing heavy knuckle gloves, swung a punch that roared through the air, aimed straight at Alexander's head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As a level-two strength metahuman, his punch could shatter rocks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He was confident that even if he didn't land a direct hit, grazing Alexander's head would be enough to give him a concussion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As Alexander faced the three metahumans closing in, Betty and the others' expressions changed dramatically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Now, they understood that Asher had been prepared all along. The earlier attack by Windwolf had just been a distraction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The combined strength of three metahumans was far more terrifying than Windwolf acting alone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Asher's face twisted into a mocking grin as he watched the scene unfold, his confidence unwavering.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He had no doubt that his three powerful men would easily capture Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But then, in the blink of an eye, everything changed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The smile vanished from Asher's face. Panic crept into his expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Windwolf and his companions' attacks landed on Alexander, but they struck nothing but air. It was only an illusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander had already disappeared. All they had attacked was the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Windwolf didn't even have time to react. He turned and found Alexander right behind him, as silent and sudden as a ghost.</span></p><div class="pagination">
