The church is definitely more powerful than it seems. If something this rare is just a casual pick-me-up for them, then someone like me is nothing more than a speck of dust in their eyes."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Logan held up the two pieces of melon rind and grinned. "Alexander, I heard that Verdant Crown Melon rinds can be sold for money. And this is from the Melon King! It's gotta be worth a fortune!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander pinched the rind. Though clearly a melon skin, it felt as smooth and solid as a finely carved emerald.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This stuff sells for money? Then let's sell it. We've been in the Hrodvik for so long and haven't even explored Darwin properly. Tomorrow, we'll take a break and go have some fun." Alexander stroked his chin and agreed without hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Logan cheered. "That's what I'm talking about!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next morning, Alexander and Logan packed up the Melon King's rind and some coins before setting off toward Darwin, home to the palace of the Hrodvik Empire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hrodvik was a vast and thriving empire, brimming with wealth and teeming with countless people. It was the heart of civilization, a land where fortune and power intertwined.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The current ruler was Quinton Kingsley, the Great Virtue Emperor, in the 46th year of his reign.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hailed as the reincarnation of the lord of heaven, Quinton was revered as the Eternal Emperor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Decades ago, the Oceanic Federation, which was an alliance of island nations including Risun, Xhantao, Norvain Republic, and the Archipelago, amassed an army claiming to number in the millions, launching an invasion upon Hrodvik in the Sahasia Continent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the time, Quinton was still the Crown Prince. Appointed as the Supreme Commander, he led a formidable yet vastly outnumbered force into war. Against all odds, he crushed the enemy at the very gates of the empire, wiping out the Oceanic Federation's entire army.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From that battle onward, Xhantao became a vassal state, paying tribute to Hrodvik, while Risun, Norvain Republic, and others dared not disrespect Hrodvik.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet peace was fleeting. In the 23rd year of Quinton's reign, the Noah Empire, the dominant power of the Noah Continent, launched a full-scale crusade against Hrodvik while Hrodvik was still recovering from its war with the Oceanic Federation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Risun and its allies eagerly offered help. They provided wealth, manpower, and resources to assist the Noah Empire's crusade against Hrodvik.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that time, the Grand Marshal of Hrodvik's forces fell prey to deceit, leading his army into disaster at Central City. Out of ten million troops, barely one in ten survived.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With no one left to stop them, the Noah coalition advanced unhindered and pushed toward Darwin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hrodvik stood on the brink of collapse. The fate of its countless citizens hung in the balance, poised to be enslaved by foreign invaders.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this critical moment, Quinton turned the war around. With help from the Dominion Church, he led 100 thousand warrior priests and the remnants of Hrodvik's army. In a bold night attack, they set the enemy's camp ablaze, burning their forces for miles. They chased the fleeing soldiers for another ten thousand miles and crushed them so completely that fewer than one in a hundred made it back to the Noah Continent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the 30th year of the reign, the previous emperor passed away, and Quinton ascended the throne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the emperor, Quinton ruled diligently, rooting out corruption and reforming the government.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under Quinton's reign, Hrodvik flourished with peace, and countless nations came to pay tribute. His people, numbering in the billions, revered him as a legend among men, bestowing on him the title of the Eternal Emperor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unlike traditional capitals, Darwin had no city walls. The metropolis stretched for ten thousand miles, home to an unfathomable number of people. At its very heart lay Mount Haldrith, where the grand Dominion Church stood in solemn majesty. Surrounding it were the palace, government ministries, noble estates, and residences of high-ranking officials.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ordinary citizens were forbidden from settling near Mount Haldrith, as it was a place of purity and divine power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thus, the closer one traveled toward the palace, the livelier and more crowded the city became.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander and Logan used the "Teleportation Plate" in the manor and reached the relay station a hundred miles away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The relay stations were scattered throughout the empire and managed by Hrodvik's government. They contained the Teleportation Plates imbued with sacred energy, which allowed swift travel between locations.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Having already reached the peak of a level-one warrior, Alexander no longer struggled with the effects of the teleportation. Logan, now on the verge of breaking through, had also grown accustomed to the sensation. Their vision blurred for only a moment. Then, they arrived at the relay station in the blink of an eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander and Logan were stunned when they stepped out of the relay station.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The streets stretched out before them, paved with perfectly laid stone slabs, so wide that ten horses could walk side by side in the alleys, and a hundred could gallop abreast on the main roads.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lining both sides were countless shops adorned with banners and signboards swaying in the breeze. Most buildings stood three to four stories, while the tallest soared over a dozen floors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The city was bustling with life. People in elegant robes were walking, riding horses or donkeys, pushing carts, or carrying goods. Laughter, chatter, and vendor calls filled the air, creating a lively scene.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They felt excitement. This was Hrodvik, a cityscape straight out of a living masterpiece.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They wandered through the city like curious foreigners, amazed by everything they saw. As they walked, Alexander felt both relaxed and awestruck. His eyes opened wide to the new sights.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Logan was having the time of his life. Hands full of lollipops and greasy sesame pastries, he chomped away with a grin stretched from ear to ear. Just as they were soaking in the vibrant scene, a sudden commotion erupted ahead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What do you think you're doing?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come now, my lady! Why don't you come with me..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get lost!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Intrigued, Alexander and Logan hurried forward, eager to claim the best spot to watch the show.</span></p><div class="pagination">
