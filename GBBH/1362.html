  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey! Their fighting skills have stepped up another notch! Let's go!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, the two had already exchanged dozens of blows.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, Hogan let out a shout, and the black gold spear in his hand surged forward, smashing through the shadows of heavy hammers and aiming directly at the giant's throat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The giant's face paled. He bent down and exited the stage, holding his bronze hammer upside down, while the crowd erupted in cheers below.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The bronze and silver medal groups were engaged in fierce battles in the arena, but the gold medal group's area remained empty. There were only a handful of gold medal disciples in the entire outer courtyard, each one a formidable opponent&mdash;rumored to be at least level five warriors, with some even capable of becoming marshals in the government!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Out of pride, they often refrained from competing. In past years, their stage would often sit vacant throughout the entire competition.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, many spectators waved white flags emblazoned with the character "Bet", crowding around the officials and obstructing their passage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander and Logan were taken aback until the Schneier brothers explained the situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The government had outlawed private casinos, and in Hrodvik's gambling establishments, the Ministry of Revenue held the majority stake, with private investors holding the rest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the Dominion Church competition seen as a favorable event, the Ministry of Revenue had opened the betting market to the public, with the gambling revenue going straight into the national treasury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander grinned, "I love this! I'm going to place a bet!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Logan retrieved a booklet from the messenger, flipped through its pages, then handed it to Alexander with a sigh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Look, Alexander, you're at the bottom of the silver medal group, and your odds are the highest!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander took the booklet and glanced through it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The gold medal group didn't allow bets, and since the silver medal group was relatively small, each disciple had individual rankings and odds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The bronze medal group had the highest number of contestants, with only a few seeded players listed alongside their odds. Hogan was included, and his odds were 1 to 100, as he was last in the silver medal group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Based on the odds, it seemed Braylon Tapia and Rhodes were the frontrunners most likely to win first place in the silver medal group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, Alexander's gaze fixed on a young man in the distance. He looked to be in his twenties, wearing a jade crown, exuding a dignified presence, clad in a silver silk shirt, and with a silver sword by his side that gave off an air of coldness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Such a strong presence&mdash;at least a level-four martial artist. Alexander sensed his ill intentions. But he didn't recognize the man at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The young man smirked disdainfully, then turned and vanished into the crowd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rhodes, blending into the crowd, felt a sneer rise in his chest. "A martial arts genius? He cracks the top 100 on the Martial Virtue Point List, but he's just a level-three warrior. How could he even take down a level-four Risunese warrior? It's just a rumor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone knows I'm a level-four warrior, but they have no idea that I've already reached the peak of level four and am on the verge of level five. I doubt he could withstand even one move from me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the afternoon of the third day of the Dominion Church competition, Hogan continued to dominate the bronze medal arena. He was truly a top-tier third-level warrior, and his spear techniques were both elusive and powerful. It was likely that he would take home the bronze medal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was secretly alert. Dominion Church was indeed a place filled with hidden talents. Hogan was a true martial arts prodigy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Alexander were in the bronze medal group, he was sure he could contend for the top spot. Hogan's aura felt quite similar to his. It would be hard to say who would come out on top without a direct comparison. Sellers and Enoch, on the other hand, seemed to be much weaker. They were only at the peak of the second level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander clapped Enoch on the shoulder, stating with determination, "No more betting on Hogan! Thankfully, I placed a 10 thousand coins bet on the first day, and I'm set to earn 200!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sellers and Enoch were upset, also wanting to earn some money, especially since it was their brother competing on stage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Logan was wide-eyed, fixated on the two fighters in the silver medal arena.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A young man, appearing around 28 or 29, with a jade hairpin, thick brows, and a sturdy build, wielded a pair of gilded eight-treasure hammers, moving up and down with agility.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Opposing him was a middle-aged man dancing with an axe. The two were locked in a fierce battle. Logan's combat power detector beeped incessantly, the numbers fluctuating wildly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The combat power is 1500 and 1160. It seems that a level-four warrior must exceed 1000 in power. The one with the hammers will take this..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Logan could finish speaking, something unexpected occurred on the stage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The hammer-wielding man roared as energy erupted from his body. The two hammers drew an unusual arc, resembling thunder and lightning, cutting through the layers of axe shadows and striking his opponent's chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The middle-aged man barely managed to raise the axe to his chest in time, but with a resounding clash of metal, he was sent flying out of the arena, a spray of blood erupting into the air.</span></p><div class="pagination">
