  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>No one could stop Alexander, and they all fell to the ground like harvested wheat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Among them were several karate masters, but unfortunately, they all faced the same outcome. Before they could grasp the situation, Alexander knocked them down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander walked into the elevator calmly, with a large group of people lying in all directions behind him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The elevator doors closed, and he pressed the button to reach the top floor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Force mark left on Sean's body was on the top floor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>On the top was the luxurious suite enjoyed by Sean. Unlike the ordinary simple decoration, it was magnificent and luxurious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even the floors and doors were golden, and all the door handles and faucets were shining with golden light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Sir, we can't get in touch with the Killer King. Could something have happened?" The white-haired old man frowned and asked worriedly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Don't worry. There is no one in this world that the Killer King cannot kill. I paid a full 500 million dollars. He must be taking action. There will be news soon."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Sean said so and looked at Benjamin, who was sitting next to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Bang!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He slammed the table hard and cursed loudly, "Benjamin, you trash. You claim to be the second-ranked gambler in the world? You are really rubbish."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Benjamin laughed and said, "You said I'm trash?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Damn it! You dare to laugh? Now your hand is broken and useless. Do you still want to show off in front of me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Sean sneered contemptuously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The old man also roared, "Mr. Walsh has supported you for so many years, but you can't even handle a casino. And you expect him to be polite to you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Hahaha..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Benjamin laughed wildly, not afraid of Sean at all, and shouted arrogantly, "Shut up, old man! You are just Sean's watchdog! What qualifications do you have to yell at me?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"And you, Sean! You useless shit! You are going to die soon. My master is here. He's going to kill you..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Benjamin laughed so hard that his tears came out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The white-haired old man was so furious that he was shaking all over. "Idiot, I will kill you now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Sean said disdainfully, "Master? Am I not your master? Who are you trying to scare with all this nonsense?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The white-haired old man walked towards Benjamin with a gloomy face, ready to give him a lesson.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Bang!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Suddenly, the door flew up and hit the ground heavily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Who!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Sean was startled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Why? You don't recognize me so soon?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander's somewhat casual and indifferent voice came.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Master, they want to kill me! Save me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Benjamin immediately begged Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"It's you? You... How did you know I was here? How did you get up here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Sean widened his eyes in surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The white-haired man's pupils constricted, and his expression was quite nervous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He knew how strict the security measures here were. It was really unbelievable that Alexander could appear here quietly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Were all the security personnel outside beaten down?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The old man's expression turned ashen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You traitor!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Sean roared and kicked Benjamin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, as soon as he raised his foot, he felt a huge force hitting his chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Sean screamed and flew out, knocking over the sofa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Stop!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The white-haired old man roared like a lion and rushed towards Alexander like lightning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He swung a punch, and the wind from his fist whistled, containing great destructive power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander didn't care at all and punched him as well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The two fists collided with each other at a terrifying speed, making a crisp sound.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The old man's right fist and entire arm exploded directly, and bloody pieces of flesh and broken white bones flew everywhere.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then Alexander kicked sideways, hitting the old man in the abdomen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Force was like a speeding truck, knocking the white-haired old man back like a cannonball that penetrated the glass and fell from more than a hundred floors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ah!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The shrill screams became lower and lower as he fell.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Sean was lying on the ground, stunned by the horrific scene.</span></p><div class="pagination">
