  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A bloodcurdling scream pierced the air as someone came flying through the doorway, crashing hard onto the floor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who the hell?" Tim jumped, recognizing his personal bodyguard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blood trickled from the guard's mouth as pure terror filled his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tim grabbed his arm. "What's going on? What happened out there?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gregory sprang to his feet in an instant, and his eyes were wide and locked on the doorway. Every muscle in his body tensed as he sensed the killing intent. He was ready to strike at any moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They... they're coming." The guard choked out between bloody coughs. "The security team... They turned on us!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What? Why would they turn on us? Did someone make it onto the island?" Tim's face went pale as dread settled in his stomach.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But it was too late to get answers</span><span>&mdash;</span><span>the bodyguard's head had already slumped forward, lifeless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Watch out!" Gregory jumped in front of Tim protectively.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who the hell is behind this? Did Rico's people take out Alexander? Are they trying to kill us too and take Treasure Island for themselves?" Tim's voice shook with rage and fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gregory's voice was ice cold. "Those pirates don't have the skills to pull this off. There's only one possibility</span><span>&mdash;</span><span>our plan actually failed."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Failed? What do we do now? We need to get out of here!" Tim was trembling uncontrollably, mumbling to himself, "I knew it would fail. I knew it... We're so screwed..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was when Alexander strolled in, wearing an eerily calm smile. "Tim, I treated you well, didn't I? So, why'd you have to betray me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's smile never wavered, but the murderous intent rolling off him had Tim stumbling backward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at Tim's ghostly pale face, Alexander let out a soft sigh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Such a shame. I really didn't want to add to the body count, but traitors... they're my least favorite people."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dead silence filled the room as Tim's face drained of all color.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm sorry, Mr. Hawthorne..." Tim bowed deeply, then set his jaw. "If I could go back and do it differently, I'd never have betrayed you. But what's done is done. There's no going back now, and I'm not ready to die."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He locked eyes with Alexander, knowing full well that only one of them would walk away from this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gregory broke into a grin. "Now that's what I'm talking about! You've got killer instinct. Let's take this guy down together. After that, Treasure Island is all yours."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tim narrowed his eyes, staying silent. He'd weathered enough storms to know better</span><span>&mdash;</span><span>in fact, the deadlier the situation, the cooler his head became.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander let out a heavy sigh. "What a waste! Cloe wasn't wrong about you</span><span>&mdash;</span><span>making you part of upper management. You've got talent. Shame you couldn't pass this little test."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is my turf." Tim snarled. "You don't get to call the shots here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without warning, Tim stomped hard on a specific floorboard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The floor split open with a crack, revealing a hidden staircase. Before anyone could react, a dozen men in black tactical gear stormed up, assault rifles trained on Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this range, with this kind of firepower, even a metahuman with super-speed wouldn't be able to dodge every bullet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, these men are my death squad. They're ready to die for me at a moment's notice," Tim said with a smirk. "And those magazines? Loaded with custom high-explosive rounds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, your biggest mistake was walking in here running your mouth. You're walking straight into hell with your eyes wide open!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tim was practically gloating now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tim, I had no idea you had it in you!" Gregory gave Tim an </span><span>impressed thumbs</span><span>-up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander let out a cold laugh. "That's all you've got? You're letting me down. Well, let's cut to the chase. It's time to send you all to hell."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment the words left his mouth, Alexander vanished into thin air as if he'd never been there at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone froze, and their jaws dropped in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Where would he go?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He was just there a second ago. Am I tripping?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>People started looking around frantically, some even pinching themselves to make sure they weren't dreaming.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There he is. Kill him!" Gregory suddenly shouted, pointing at a shadowy corner.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The air erupted with gunfire as bullets rained down on the shadow like a deadly storm.</span></p><div class="pagination">
