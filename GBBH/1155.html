  <div class="container"><p style="text-align:left;">Karson quickly said, &quot;Alex, I&#x27;ll give you a ride! If it weren&#x27;t for you today, I&#x27;d be a goner.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;I&#x27;ll transfer the 60-million-dollar reward to you immediately, and from now on, any goods passing through Louvian Port under Ultimate Alliance will be completely free of charge!&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Alexander looked at Karson with surprise. He thought, &quot;This guy really has some guts.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">After a moment of thought, he reminded him, &quot;Mr. Chapman, if we can&#x27;t catch Yinson, I think you should start stocking up on supplies just in case.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Karson paused, then quickly realized.</p><p style="text-align:left;">His expression became serious as he asked, &quot;Alex, do you think Yinson&#x27;s Apocalypse Project will really succeed? That the world will face a great catastrophe?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Alexander gave a smile, patted his shoulder, and turned to leave.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Karson&#x27;s expression immediately turned sour.</p><p style="text-align:left;">*****</p><p style="text-align:left;">Risun was a country made up of several large islands and many smaller ones, shaped like a pearl necklace across the ocean.</p><p style="text-align:left;">In a temple of Kylaville, which had a history of several hundred years, a massive hall housed a fierce-looking statue over thirty-two feet tall, with four heads and eight arms.</p><p style="text-align:left;">The statue was entwined by a giant serpent, its massive mouth open wide as though it might come to life at any moment.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Yinson sat beneath the statue, eyes half-closed as if in prayer.</p><p style="text-align:left;">He remained still, his heartbeat barely detectable. No ordinary person would notice he was even there.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Like Alexander, he, too, could completely conceal his presence.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Mr. White... something&#x27;s happened...&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Suddenly, an anxious voice broke the silence, and a young man hurriedly ran in.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Yinson raised his head and shouted, &quot;What&#x27;s the rush? Bow!&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">With a wave of his hand, the man let out a horrified scream as an invisible force slammed him to the ground.</p><p style="text-align:left;">The man fell, blood streaming from his nose, but he didn&#x27;t dare utter a word, hastily clutching his nose and bowing.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Next time you act so recklessly, it won&#x27;t just be a bloody nose. You&#x27;ll lose your head!&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Yinson stood up and coldly looked down at him.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Yes, Mr. White!&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">The man quickly nodded, bowing his head in respect.</p><p style="text-align:left;">After a moment, Yinson slowly asked, &quot;What happened?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Mr. White, just now we received word that Mr. Merrett has disappeared in Louvian... and Tyler&#x27;s squad assigned to Loscity has been wiped out.&quot; the man spoke in a deep voice.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Stephen is missing?&quot; Yinson was somewhat surprised.</p><p style="text-align:left;">His eyes narrowed, and he sneered, &quot;It was probably that little brat, Alexander. Heh, Stephen&#x27;s no big deal. If he&#x27;s missing, so be it. After all, he underwent the enhancement drugs, loyal as ever. Even if he&#x27;s dead, he wouldn&#x27;t betray us.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;They were just our first-generation test subjects. We already have over a hundred test subjects. We can just send a few more out.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Yes, Mr. White, wise as always!&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">The man lay flat on the ground.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Yinson smiled faintly, &quot;No one would expect that at this moment, Sakra Society is stronger than ever. We have more than a hundred test subjects like Stephen.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;And these test subjects&#x27; strength will only continue to grow until they break human limits!</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Then, the entire planet will be mine.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Yinson clenched his fist and swung it with force.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Aren&#x27;t you going to make arrangements? Release test subjects number two through ten to lead the teams. Control those wealthy elites quickly. I&#x27;ll take care of the rest.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Yes, Mr. White.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">The middle-aged man did not dare delay, bowing as he quickly left.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Alexander, just wait and see. Apart from Loscity and Louvian, most of the counties and cities around you are already under my control.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;I&#x27;ll make you bow and beg for mercy. The grudge of that day, I&#x27;ll repay it tenfold!&quot; Yinson muttered to himself, then sat again at the statue&#x27;s feet, closing his eyes.</p><p style="text-align:left;">A strange and cold aura began to spread...</p><p style="text-align:left;">In a scenic, wealthy district of Loscity, Alexander drove up to a luxurious villa. This was Rebecca&#x27;s new home, worth over 100 million dollars.</p><p style="text-align:left;">As the heiress to the Hansen family, Rebecca never hesitated to spend money.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Who? Stop!&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Alexander was blocked by two security guards.</p><div class="pagination">
