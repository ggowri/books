  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Days had slipped by, and Alexander couldn't stop wondering about the state of Loscity. With both zombies and mutant beasts evolving, did humanity even stand a chance anymore?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stared down at the monsters roaming the streets below, a bitter taste in his mouth. Lighting another cigarette, he took a deep drag and blew out a perfect smoke ring.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The scene below was grim&mdash;about a hundred zombies crowded the street, and among them, he could spot around fifteen that had clearly evolved. Some had developed enhanced speed, while others had mutated to possess incredible strength. Those seemed to be the two main types.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thought of Earthia's population&mdash;billions of people&mdash;made Alexander's stomach turn. Even if all those billions of monsters lined up for him to kill, he'd die of exhaustion before he could finish the job.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes drifted to Sakra Tower in the distance, but there wasn't a single soul in sight. The emptiness was getting to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feeling restless and fed up, Alexander grabbed his machete and headed out the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the elevators dead, he had to take the stairs. As he made his way down the hallway, zombies in the surrounding rooms caught his scent. Their inhuman screams filled the air as they clawed desperately at their doors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One of the strength-enhanced zombies actually managed to break through its door, bursting into the hallway.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It charged straight at Alexander, but he didn't miss a beat. In one fluid motion, his machete sliced through the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The zombie's head went flying as its massive body crashed to the ground, twitching violently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander made his way down to the street, taking out a few more zombies with ease along the way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What the hell?" he muttered. The zombies that had been roaming the streets moments ago had completely vanished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Black blood stains still marked the pavement, and the landscape had taken on an eerie transformation. The bushes in the roadside planters had withered away, replaced by overgrown weeds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cars were abandoned in the middle of the street, while storefronts displayed shattered windows and wide-open doors. The scattered debris created a disturbing scene straight out of an apocalyptic nightmare.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Alexander approached the convenience store, something felt off. There was a strange energy in the air, but he wasn't fazed by it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Something was watching him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His heightened senses picked up on it immediately. He was being stalked. Yet nothing jumped out at him, even as he stepped into the store.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking around, he could tell the place had gone to hell in just over a week.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A faint stench hung in the air. All the fresh produce and frozen meat had spoiled, filling the space with the smell of decay.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander grabbed a shopping basket and casually browsed the aisles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite the apocalypse raging outside, his incredible powers let him shop as calmly as anyone would have in the old world before everything went to hell.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's shopping basket was packed to the brim with survival essentials: high-calorie packaged foods like chocolate and candy, cans of vegetables and meat, several bottles of water, and a couple of packs of cigarettes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He casually headed back toward the hotel, carrying the heavy basket that must have weighed at least fifty pounds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he turned to leave, the sensation of being watched grew stronger with each step.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A cold smirk crossed Alexander's face. He was counting on the beast to make its move, and when it did, he'd make sure it lived to regret it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Alexander reached the hotel steps, a bone-chilling presence crept up behind him. The danger was imminent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A massive, pitch-black mutant panther materialized behind him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The creature had approached in complete silence, its enormous head crowned with blood-red eyes that gleamed with murderous intent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Razor-sharp teeth filled its mouth, and deadly claws&mdash;like steel daggers&mdash;extended from its thick paw pads, glinting in the light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It didn't make sense. The city center was supposed to be the territory of the undead and zombies, with mutant beasts sticking to the outskirts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But this panther was clearly powerful enough to ignore those unwritten rules.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a flash, the mutant panther launched itself skyward, descending like a bolt of lightning with its jaws aimed straight at Alexander's head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The mutant black panther, so confident just moments ago, blinked in confusion as its jaws snapped through empty air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The human who had been right in front of it had vanished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blood-red eyes flickering with confusion and shock, the creature whipped its head around desperately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A flash of steel cut through the air, and a blade buried itself deep in the panther's body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Alexander's machete. Enhanced by the Force, even an ordinary blade could pierce the mutant panther's hide.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The blade sank deep, and blood poured from the wound.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander stood calmly, still holding his shopping basket with all the groceries intact, fixing the mutant panther with a dangerous look.</span></p><div class="pagination">
