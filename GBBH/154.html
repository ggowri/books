  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nick trembled uncontrollably under the menacing aura radiating from Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get lost! The next time I see you, you're going to get it," Alexander said, casually tossing Nick aside like yesterday's trash.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thugs who had been knocked down scrambled to their feet and fled in a panic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Nick ran, he shouted recklessly, "Alexander, you think you can hit me? Just wait! I'll find someone tougher to take you down. Don't even think about stealing my house! Old hag, if you dare give it to someone else, I swear I'll make you pay."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily, her eyes swollen from crying, stammered, "Alexander, I'm... so... so sorry! Nick has lost his mind!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was torn between worry for Alexander and concern for her son; after all, Nick was her flesh and blood, someone she had raised from the ground up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aunt Lily, don't worry. In </span><span>Loscity</span><span>, we don't have to fear anyone. That old house of yours is pretty run-down anyway; I'll help you find a nice new place," Alexander reassured her gently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was now financially stable and planned to get Lily a villa, complete with a nanny and caregiver to look after her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, Lily had been good to him; aside from the father he had never met and Ashley, she was his only family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A new house? That sounds too expensive... really, it's not necessary. I just want you </span><span>to be safe and happy with Ms. Blackburn," Lily replied, wiping away her tears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, shouts and curses echoed from the hallway. Nick was back, this time with a gang of goons looking for trouble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Depp, you've got to back me up! That punk is trying to steal the house my mom left me... Don't worry, if my mom signs the papers, I'll sell the house and definitely cut you in on the deal..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nick was shamelessly buttering up a scrawny guy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The scrawny guy's face darkened, but when he heard Nick mention the split, a sinister grin crept across his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nick kicked the door open, glaring at Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Depp, it's this guy. I need you to break his legs!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander merely chuckled at the sight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mr. Depp, whose full name was Dalton Depp, was just a lackey under Billy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ever since Billy had died, Betty had taken over Wolf Gang entirely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Augusta had carefully selected a new, younger crew, leaving aging members like Dalton at the bottom of the hierarchy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, with Wolf Gang's transformation into the Ultimate Alliance, even the lowest members were enjoying better treatment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Surprisingly, Dalton was thriving in this new environment, enjoying both wealth and leisure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dalton, are you really going to help this idiot against me?" Alexander asked nonchalantly, his calm voice laced with a chilling undertone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn! Alexander, how dare you call Mr. Depp by his first name? You must be tired of living!" Nick shouted angrily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dalton, visibly shaken, grabbed Nick by the collar and slammed him against the wall, delivering a flurry of slaps that left Nick howling in pain, his cheeks swelling like balloons.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Depp, why are you hitting me?" Nick whimpered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Nick, you ungrateful punk, I'm hitting you because you deserve it!" Dalton growled, landing two punishing punches to Nick's gut that left him curled up on the floor like a boiled shrimp.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hold him down! Make him apologize to Mr. Hawthorne!" Dalton barked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A few men rushed in to pin Nick's arms, forcing him to grovel before Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, with a look of deep respect, Dalton approached Alexander, bowing deeply before speaking carefully, "Mr. Hawthorne, I had no idea this guy was your enemy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If I had known, I would have dealt with him long ago."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was his boss' boss, and if he decided to dig into this situation, Dalton would be in deep trouble&mdash;potentially a one-way ticket to disaster.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sweat drenched Dalton's shirt as he felt the icy grip of fear. He wished he could kick Nick, the walking disaster, out of the picture for good.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander shot him a cold glance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't ever get involved in shady dealings like this again. This is your one and only warning. If I catch you pulling something like this again, I won't hesitate to end you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Y... yes, yes! I swear I won't do it again! Thank you, Mr. Hawthorne, thank you!" </span><span>Dalton stammered, nodding profusely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked so meek and submissive; it was as if he were Alexander's child begging for forgiveness.</span></p><div class="pagination">
