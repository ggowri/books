  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yannick's position in the research department was second only to Elaine, so Alexander obtained a lot of top-secret information.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He compressed the information and sent it to his email.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then Alexander found out about Hazel. She was not here, and her identity was still a female slave, so she would not be in danger for the time being.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander felt that things would be much easier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I must destroy this base!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander looked at everyone with a determined look.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melin and the others nodded. The situation was critical now. Apart from destroying the base, there was no other way to stop these people.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Besides, with Alexander here, they believed they have a chance to do it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What do you need us to do?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone looked at Alexander with anticipation and regarded him as their leader.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander said, "Wait here. I'll go capture Elaine first. I think she's the only one who knows how to destroy the immortality potion and ruin this place."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But you are alone. We can help you..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melin wanted to persuade him, but Alexander was determined.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said, "Don't worry about me. Instead, you should be careful. It's safer here. I will use a code when I knock on the door. One hard knock and three soft knocks. I'll repeat twice."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, Alexander opened the door and disappeared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Close the door and wait for me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The police officers could only pray, hoping that God would bless Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As time passed, the atmosphere became more and more tense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every minute that passed felt like a century to Melin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the steamy bathroom, Elaine was lying in the warm water, closing her eyes and enjoying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She took a deep breath and felt comfortable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her full breasts swayed in the water.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There isn't a single strong man here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elaine hummed and couldn't help but put her hand between her legs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was a woman with a strong sexual appetite, but in Base One, she was surrounded by powerless researchers and rude guards.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elaine wanted a man, but she looked down on those guards at the bottom of the social ladder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, the bathroom door slowly opened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elaine frowned, thinking that she probably didn't close the door tightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She grabbed one of her breasts with her left hand and rubbed it vigorously, while her right hand sped up between her legs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just when Elaine was about to reach climax, she felt something was wrong, as if there was someone in front of her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She suddenly opened her eyes and screamed in fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander grabbed Elaine's throat without waiting for her to scream out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elaine's body suddenly tensed up, and her legs tightly clamped together, which actually gave her an incomparable pleasure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was helpless. Elaine reached orgasm in front of him. Her eyes were seductive, her whole body was trembling, and even her breasts were shaking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Between life and death, this perverted woman with a sex addiction felt unprecedented satisfaction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Please! Please... Don't kill me..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elaine begged Alexander and tried hard to show off her sexy body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander didn't intend to kill her immediately and just wanted to give her a warning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander threw her into the bathtub.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said, "Tell me where is the immortality potion stored? How did the base self-destruct?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The cold murderous aura brought Elaine back to her senses from the afterglow of her climax.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She sighed and asked Alexander with a complicated expression, "How did you sneak in?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander looked at her coldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said, "Stop talking nonsense. Answer my question. Maybe I can let you go."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elaine had a hot body, big breasts and a plump butt. She had been developed and trained by men. Such women were good at pleasing men.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elaine did not reply. Instead, </span><span>She</span><span> held up her breasts with both hands, rubbed them hard, and seduced Alexander with a coquette expression.</span></p><div class="pagination">
