I'll keep a close watch on him and won't act recklessly unless I'm sure I can take him out in one go.]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Bruno felt a surge of fighting spirit and tightly gripped the hilt of his knife.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the kitchen, Alexander was busy cooking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wore an apron, skillfully washing and chopping vegetables with impressive knife skills.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava and Rebecca entered the kitchen, and their curiosity piqued as they watched Alexander's expert movements.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wanting to impress them, Alexander moved the knife quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava and Rebecca were mesmerized as he swiftly prepared steak, chicken, and fish, neatly plating them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Within moments, he had minced ginger, chopped green onions, and other seasonings ready.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava and Rebecca were left in awe by the seamless flow of his actions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, you're definitely a Michelin-star chef!"

While she felt a hint of jealousy, she couldn't voice it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smiled proudly and continued working.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He heated a pan, coated it with olive oil, and seared the steaks. The kitchen quickly filled with an enticing aroma that made both Rebecca's and Ava's mouths water.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he flipped the steaks, he added butter, garlic, and thyme to the pan, enhancing the already incredible scent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The pan-seared steaks, accompanied by sweet potatoes, looked so wonderful that Ava and Rebecca couldn't help but drool.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In less than an hour, Alexander had prepared five dishes and a soup. It was truly impressive!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rebecca and Ava sat on either side of Alexander, and they all enjoyed the meal together.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They devoured everything in no time, and luckily, Alexander had cooked enough to satisfy their appetites.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Half an hour later, all the dishes were completely gone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava and Rebecca's bellies were slightly rounded from overeating, but their expressions reflected pure satisfaction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a brief rest, Alexander hugged Ava and asked, "How was my cooking? Did you like it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, it was amazing!" Ava replied, blushing as she breathed in Alexander's masculine scent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander grinned, "I cooked for you today. How do you plan to thank me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you? What kind of thank you do you want?"

After washing up, she leaned against the bathroom door, straining to hear the sounds outside, but there was silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After waiting for a long time, Ava had to come out wrapped in a bath towel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, when she stepped into the living room, she froze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rebecca was kneeling with her head buried in a pillow, her backside raised high.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was behind her, thrusting away, and Rebecca's face was awash with pleasure, lost in the moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava had lingered in the bathroom for half an hour, and Rebecca could no longer hold back her desires.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, Rebecca lifted her head and clung to Alexander's arm, her backside shaking as she reached her climax.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Exhausted, Rebecca collapsed onto the sofa, panting for breath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander chuckled, clearly satisfied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He caressed Rebecca's curvy body for a moment before striding over to Ava, naked.</span></p><div class="pagination">
