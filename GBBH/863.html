  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Oh! It's really wonderful..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As his hot seeds were spread across her garden, Norma let out a cry of delight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Well... Daddy, you're so awesome!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The intense pleasure even made Norma roll her eyes. Her whole body convulsed, and she kept letting out unconscious moans.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Norma blushed and snuggled in Alexander's arms, shyly saying, "Master, you are so bad that you just bully me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander stroked her hair and said with a smile, "Since I am Daddy, you should be nicer to me in the future."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You are bad. So bad..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Norma hugged Alexander tighter, feeling extremely satisfied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After the two of them rested for a while, Alexander said calmly, "Since Sean wants to kill you, I won't waste any time. I'll go have a talk with him later. After he dies, you will not only be the leader of the Dragon Gang, but also the head of the Walsh family!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The cold, murderous aura emanating from Alexander seemed to penetrate her bones, causing the temperature to drop several degrees suddenly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing that Alexander was about to go and settle the score with Sean, Norma immediately calmed down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"But Sean is very cunning. Sometimes I don't even know where he is."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Well, when I met him, I had already left a mark on him without anyone noticing. I know where he is. Your headquarters building."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander got up and started to put on his clothes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Norma quickly sat up and asked with concern, "What do you need me to do? Wait a minute. I'll gather some people right away..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"No need. Just prepare yourself, and in an hour at most, you can become the head of the Walsh family. Sean is nothing. I can kill him in a breeze!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander's figure had disappeared. Only his pleasant voice came and echoed in Norma's ears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Norma stood there stupidly, full of admiration and awe for Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He was able to deal with Sean by himself and make her the head in just one hour.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If Alexander hadn't mentally controlled Norma, she would definitely not have believed it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After a while, Norma changed her clothes and walked out of the office quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ms. Walsh, don't worry. Our boss always keeps his word!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marvin, standing at the door of the office, was very proud.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Norma looked at him with complicated eyes and said, "I thought you went with him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marvin scratched his head embarrassedly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne asked me to stay here to protect you! Ms. Walsh, you'd better go gather your men and prepare to become the head. Time waits for no one."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander and Norma stayed in there for more than an hour. Marvin vaguely heard the seductive moans and knew what happened between the two, so he was very respectful to Norma.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Norma took a few deep breaths, finally suppressed the excitement in her heart, nodded vigorously, and said, "Okay, I'll go gather some people right away!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Dragon Gang's headquarters building was one of the tallest buildings in Kylaville.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander had stepped onto the stairs of the building and walked inside calmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He never thought about hiding or sneaking in but walked in directly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Stop there! Who let you in?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You dare to barge in? Do you want to die? Do you know where it is?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A dozen burly security guards rushed over and blocked Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander completely ignored them and continued striding forward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Pretending not to hear me? Get out!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Someone pushed Alexander hard, for they didn't think Alexander had any ability.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ah!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The guy had just stretched out his hand halfway when he let out a scream, fell to the ground, and didn't move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His Adam's apple was broken, but no one saw clearly how Alexander did it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander continued to move forward leisurely, as if he was taking a walk in the garden after dinner, relaxed and leisurely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Let's take him down together!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The remaining security guards knew something was wrong and rushed forward like a group of vicious wolves to surround Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The next second, they all covered their throats, stomachs, or heads and fell heavily to the ground one by one.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>No one could see clearly how Alexander made his move.</span></p><div class="pagination">
