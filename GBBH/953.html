  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop! You're not going anywhere!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grace charged forward, blocking his way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A flash of sharpness flickered in Alexander's eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a casual flick of his fingers, a surge of invisible force ripped through the air, flashing past Grace's ear like lightning, and slammed into a massive tree behind her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The tree, as thick as a barrel, now had a hole in its trunk, clean through, so clear you could see right through to the other side.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gavin's face went ghostly pale. He immediately stepped forward to beg, "Mr. Hawthorne, please spare her!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thankfully, Alexander didn't strike again, or no amount of begging would've saved Grace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grace instinctively reached up to her earlobe, but the earring was gone. Her cheek burned with pain, and her legs felt like jelly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Alexander had wanted to kill her, her head would've been shattered like a watermelon, no question.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The bodyguards' faces turned ashen, and one by one, they lay flat on the ground, playing dead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gavin took a deep breath, trying to calm his nerves, but couldn't help himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne, you truly are a master. Your strength is unimaginable. If I'm not mistaken, you must already be a Grand Master, able to harm with a flick of the wrist. Invincible!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander gave a faint smile but didn't respond.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gavin muttered to himself, his tone laced with regret, "I've spent decades training in martial arts, but I'm no match for you. All those years of effort feel wasted now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He bowed his head respectfully. "I apologize on behalf of my granddaughter!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Alexander had become even more of a figure of awe in Gavin's eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A Grand Master so young meant his future was limitless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Alexander had decided to kill him, no one in the area would've made it out alive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grace stepped over to the tree and cautiously examined the hole, which was about the size of a thumb.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She touched it, still in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What kind of weapon did you use just now? It couldn't have been just a finger flick, </span><span>right?" she asked, her voice filled with wonder and doubt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander ignored her, preparing to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The bodyguards remained perfectly still, not daring to make a sound.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had seen plenty of dangerous people in their line of work, but nothing like Alexander. His power was on a whole different level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, Gavin clutched his chest and started coughing violently, as though his lungs were about to burst out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Grandpa, are you okay? Call an ambulance! Hang in there!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grace's voice cracked with worry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gavin had spent his life as a warrior, surviving countless battles, but his old injuries were severe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His illness had flared up now, triggered by the shock of seeing Alexander's strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grace's heart raced.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The doctor had already warned them. If his old injuries flared up again, Gavin didn't have long to live.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander scanned Gavin with All-seeing Eyes briefly, and he spoke calmly, "Your old injuries are too severe, Mr. Lawson. You don't have much time left. It's best you go home and rest. You might have six months, at most."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Six months? That's all I have left?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gavin was unwilling to accept it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He coughed and pushed, "Mr. Hawthorne, with your medical expertise, surely there's something you can do?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I... I'll make sure to repay you. We can split the profits from the magic powder 70-30. You take the larger share. I'll also put a stop to the Ghost's interference."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He pleaded desperately, hoping for a miracle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grace's face flushed as she gathered the courage to speak up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her eyes, wide and hopeful, were fixed on him. She desperately wanted to ask Alexander for help but felt too embarrassed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gavin was everything to her. She had seen him suffer through the pain of his old </span><span>wounds</span><span> countless times, and it tore at her every time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately, even after seeking out the best doctors and hospitals, no one had been able to cure him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For all these years, he had only been able to survive with medication.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But as he got older, the medicine's effects were wearing off. It was as if he were a fish stranded on land, just waiting for the inevitable. Death was now only a matter of time.</span></p><div class="pagination">
