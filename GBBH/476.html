As long as I'm here, forget about it! My family has money, and today I'm going to make sure you don't get what you want!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nate had made up his mind. No matter what, he was determined to mess with </span><span>Alexander, to try and put him down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fifteen million dollars!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smiled at Nate and raised the bid by another million. To him, it was just a drop in the bucket.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the battle between the two heated up, most others in the room decided to sit back and watch the show, eager to see how it would unfold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Think you can scare me? Sixteen million dollars!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nate shouted confidently, raising the bid by another million.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Eighteen million dollars."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander casually upped the ante by two million dollars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Eighteen million and one hundred thousand dollars."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nate's face turned pale. He only raised it by a hundred thousand this time&mdash;clearly starting to feel the pinch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although the gemstone was indeed top quality, it was small, and its market value was at most seventeen million. Now, the price had already surpassed that by over a million.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Twenty million dollars."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander spoke lightly, raising the price by nearly two million dollars, utterly calm and composed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn bastard! This guy's insane!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nate cursed through gritted teeth, clearly hesitating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Twenty million and one hundred thousand dollars."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He eventually raised it by just one hundred thousand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But everyone could tell&mdash;this was his limit. He couldn't go much higher.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, are you an idiot? This gemstone is worth at most eighteen million, and you're willing to pay twenty million dollars? Are you nuts?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nate taunted Alexander, trying to rile him up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smirked, "You can't afford it, so why act tough? Get lost! I've got money to burn. You don't like it? Too bad. Do something about it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Twenty-one million dollars!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander added another nine hundred thousand without blinking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The room erupted in murmurs of shock, everyone buzzing in disbelief as they tried to figure out who Alexander was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one understood the importance of the gemstone to Alexander. Even if it cost him two hundred million, he wouldn't hesitate&mdash;he needed it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Alexander's domineering attitude, Nate knew he'd lost again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While Nate's family was indeed wealthy, overpaying by millions for a gemstone wasn't smart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fine, you win this time!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nate stormed off, frustrated and humiliated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava couldn't hide her delight at seeing Nate put in his place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for the twenty million dollars, she didn't give it a second thought&mdash;just like Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Twenty-one million dollars, first call!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leo Jenkins raised the auction gavel, his voice full of excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Twenty-one million dollars, second call!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one else made a sound.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Third call&mdash;sold!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leo brought the gavel down hard. The rare blue sapphire was officially Alexander's.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, with the rare red and blue gemstones in his possession, Alexander only needed five more&mdash;orange, yellow, green, indigo, and violet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ladies and gentlemen, our next item is a rare piece&mdash;a bracelet retrieved by an archaeologist from an ancient thousand-year-old tomb. Its material is still unidentified."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leo swept his gaze across the audience, his tone lifting a few notches.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing Leo's introduction, many people started whispering among themselves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their eyes were glued to the stage&mdash;it was clear that quite a few attendees had come specifically for this mysterious bracelet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A bracelet from an ancient tomb? Made of an unknown material?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's interest was piqued.</span></p><div class="pagination">
