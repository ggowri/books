  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmm..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brittany closed her eyes in comfort, her body relaxing as she shifted slightly against the bed. Tilting her head back, she arched her back off the surface, forming a graceful curve with her waist suspended in the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, her fingers slid into Alexander's hair, gently massaging his scalp.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander grabbed her calves, lifting them firmly, and rested them on his shoulders.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Heh, call me 'Daddy' if you want me to stop," he teased.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Brittany could fully process </span><span>what</span><span> he meant, a sudden and overwhelming sensation filled her. Alexander had already gone all-in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brittany let out a long sigh, a sound of deep satisfaction and joy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was completely immersed in the feeling, unwilling for it to end.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smirked, his hands bracing on either side of her body as he began moving like a high-powered machine on a construction site.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His muscles tensed, reaching an incredible speed in a matter of seconds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brittany's soft moans echoed through the room...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Time flew by. By evening, after dinner in the dining hall, the team's assault on the Sakra Society's secret base was about to commence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander felt refreshed and at his peak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While Alexander was in his room preparing, Quentin came over to let him know he'd be joining the mission.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander suddenly asked, "Sir Thompson, have you hurt your back recently? That might affect your performance."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Huh! How did you know?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quentin was shocked. How did Alexander know he had been injured?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Brittany didn't know about it. Quentin had used a power elixir to enhance his body. Though he'd gained firearm power, he had injured himself during training.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My back hasn't fully healed, but it shouldn't be a big issue. To completely recover, it'd take two or three months, but we can't wait that long.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Besides, this mission is critical. I trust you to lead, but I have to go too. I need to be able to give an account to those above.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Still, I didn't expect your observational skills to be this sharp. You figured it out in one glance!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quentin laughed heartily, amazed at Alexander's keen perception.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Of course, Quentin wanted Alexander to be as strong as possible. Considering his granddaughter's connection with him, it would only be beneficial.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The stronger Alexander was, the more likely this mission would succeed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sir Thompson, how about I heal your injury first? It might hold you back. The Sakra </span><span>Society isn't going to go easy on us; the fight will definitely be intense."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander said with genuine concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How long would it take to heal? We're about to leave; I doubt there's enough time," Quentin asked skeptically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While Quentin trusted Alexander's abilities, he was doubtful about his capacity to heal the injury quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, healing muscle and bone injuries usually took time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry, Sir Thompson. I won't charge you for it, ha!" Alexander joked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Haha..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quentin chuckled as well, "Alright, Alexander, give it a shot. Don't push yourself if it doesn't work. I'll be careful."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Quentin said that, he didn't have high hopes for Alexander's suggestion&mdash;it was worth a try.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smiled faintly. He could already tell from Quentin's expression that he wasn't convinced.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without explaining, Alexander focused the Force into his right palm and began massaging Quentin's back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Streams of powerful Force surged into Quentin's back, healing his injuries.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the Force Cure, the minor injury fully recovered within minutes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quentin now felt a comforting warmth all over, especially in his back. Moments ago, it had ached and restricted his movement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, there was no pain at all, and he felt incredibly light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What... What just happened? Alexander, you're amazing! I'm impressed!" Quentin exclaimed, thrilled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quentin was so excited he didn't know what to say.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without the burden of his back injury, his strength had increased by at least 20%. For the upcoming battle, this could be life-saving.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Quentin so excited, Alexander chuckled and patted him on the shoulder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry. This time, we'll definitely succeed!"</span><span> </span></p><div class="pagination">
