  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander faced a brutal attack and found himself in a life-or-death situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The elite special forces squad worked with impeccable </span><span>coordination,</span><span> their movements almost synchronized.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A cold smile appeared at the corner of Alexander's mouth, his eyes turning razor-sharp.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Force gathered into a swirling vortex inside him, spinning violently and surging with fury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander unleashed "Force Confinement," and the entire world seemed to freeze in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bullets and enemy movements appeared to be in slow motion, like a video played in slow speed, moving at a snail's pace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Alexander remained unaffected, moving as fast as lightning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Johnny and his team noticed nothing unusual, seeing only dozens of bullets tearing through Alexander's body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hahaha!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were overjoyed, convinced that Alexander was dead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But in the next second, Johnny was stunned, wondering if he was hallucinating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All the bullets seemed to have struck Alexander directly, yet they had missed entirely, and his figure vanished without a trace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was just an afterimage!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's speed had reached such a peak that it created an afterimage, making them believe he'd been hit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, a figure appeared beside Johnny, throwing a punch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The punch roared with such force that it emitted a sharp, piercing sound, slamming into his chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bang!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Johnny flew backward like a cannonball, crashing hard to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His chest and ribs shattered completely, blood gushing from his mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Noah, who had been hit in the leg, tried to crawl backward but was caught by Alexander in two steps and slammed onto the floor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Crack!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sound of breaking bones and tearing tendons echoed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Noah's neck snapped, his eyes wide open in terror, filled with fear, as he died unpeacefully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the blink of an eye, Alexander had taken down two of them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adrian and another teammate, who had rushed forward, were now paralyzed with fear, unsure whether to charge ahead or retreat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, gunfire rang out again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One of them was shot in the chest by Charlize, crashing hard to the ground as blood gushed out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adrian snapped out of it, throwing a dagger at Alexander before turning to flee.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander stepped his foot, causing the hard floor to suddenly crack open.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The terrifying recoil launched him forward like a bolt, landing a punch squarely on Adrian's back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ugh!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adrian spat blood violently, rolling far across the ground like a ball.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander had no intention of letting him go; Adrian's dagger had conveniently fallen in front of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He kicked the dagger, causing a piercing sound as it sliced through the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The dagger shot like an arrow, piercing Adrian's chest and pinning him brutally against the wall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a flash, the elite squad was reduced to just Johnny, barely clinging to life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His broken ribs had punctured his lungs, and he was coughing up blood, his heavy breathing resembling a worn-out accordion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander approached him, looking down with contempt in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Please... don't... don't kill me..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Johnny stammered, begging for his life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander shook his head. "I'll deliver you to Schroder as a welcoming gift."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he finished speaking, Alexander gestured slightly, and the dagger on the ground flew into his hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Swish!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The dagger pierced straight into the man's heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander felt no mercy toward his enemies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even in death, the man's eyes were wide open, still filled with terror as they stared at Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Across the building, William and Charlize were once again amazed by Alexander's skills.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was simply too fierce; he took down the elite special forces team in no time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although they were sniping from the shadows, Alexander had faced the assault of four elite operatives alone, coming out completely unscathed. It's something they couldn't have achieved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Augusta arrived with Marvin, followed by a dozen Fraternity subordinates.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Clean up the scene quickly! Leave no trace!" Augusta ordered, waving his hand. Everyone swiftly got to work.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Alexander turned around, his sharp gaze locking onto a woman across the street.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There's still one who slipped through the net!" he announced.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Augusta and the others were stunned. None of their surveillance had noticed her. How did the Boss spot her?</span></p><div class="pagination">
