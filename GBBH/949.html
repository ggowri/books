  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jake had committed dozens of crimes in the outskirts of </span><span>Loscity</span><span> and finally gathered an army of over a hundred zombies, all under the control of a few living dead. On a dark, windy night, he was planning to attack a small town.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But what he hadn't anticipated was the sudden exposure of the Sakra Society's Apocalypse Project from </span><span>Risun</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The military stationed in </span><span>Loscity</span><span> quickly mobilized. After heavy losses and several hundred casualties, they finally managed to wipe out Jake and his entire zombie army with overwhelming firepower.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The government quickly locked down all information, and the public had no clue how close </span><span>Loscity</span><span> had come to a full-blown biological disaster.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But high-ranking officials like Ava received detailed reports from various sources, including videos from the battle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sight of those creatures, just like the zombies from movies, was enough to send a chill down her spine. Ava was genuinely shaken by the footage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This only deepened her worries about Alexander's safety, making it impossible for her to eat or sleep properly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander spent a little time with his daughter before giving orders for Rosalia and Charlize to handle the security.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, it was just him and Ava in the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He flashed a grin and pulled her into his arms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry. We'll turn Treasure and Devil Island into our strongholds. When the real crisis hits, we'll leave </span><span>Loscity</span><span> and head straight to Treasure Island."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava shuddered </span><span>slightly,</span><span> her gaze intense as she met his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So... you're saying the biological crisis is inevitable? No wonder you've had me </span><span>stockpiling billions in supplies, weapons, and ammo."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander sighed, then gave her a playful pat on the backside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yinson isn't going to back down, and there are other big shots involved, greedy, power-hungry people who all want immortality.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As long as those idiots keep chasing impossible dreams, things are bound to fall apart."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava nodded solemnly, her eyes filled with a mixture of concern and resolve.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You've done well. If it weren't for you, this disaster would have come much sooner. It's been held off for now... but if it happens, we'll face it head-on, together."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She buried her face in his chest, her voice soft but thick with emotion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you have any idea how much I love you? I'm so afraid I'll lose you. If I could, I'd give my life for you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's heart skipped a beat, and without a second thought, he pulled her even closer, gently lowering her onto the bed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His kiss traced Ava's neck and earlobes, making her tremble with excitement and clung to him tightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I miss you..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His hand slid into her shirt, gently pushed aside her bra, kneading her plump and tender breasts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Babe, how is it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander held her nipple in his mouth, his nimble tongue teasing and licking it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mm, it's amazing..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava flushed, relishing it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander carefully unbuttoned her shirt and bra, and they immediately shifted, a slight tremor running through them as they moved in front of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her skin was tender and smooth, with a faint hint of veins just beneath the surface, drawing attention to her delicate form in a way that was almost irresistible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander took eager, soft bites, his lips drawing her in as he gently kissed and nibbled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava gripped his head firmly, pressing it eagerly against her chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Where's your mom?" Alexander asked, his tone casual.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava playfully dug her fingers into his chest, a teasing glint in her eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're such a creep. Want me to invite my mom over too? She's out dealing with some work stuff."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander laughed, sensing that she wasn't really mad.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this point, his hand had slipped deeper, gently caressing the delicate hidden garden.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was like a diligent gardener, carefully tending to the blossoms and greenery within.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A wave of tingling sensations, almost like an electric shock, spread through Ava's body, causing her to gasp uncontrollably.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander lay back on the bed as she straddled him, her hands steadying herself as she slowly took him in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His hardness slowly faded, melding seamlessly with her as if swallowed by the depths.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their bodies were slick with sweat, the friction making everything feel slick and heated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava knew Alexander liked this position, as it gave him an unbroken view of her movements, the rhythm of her body shifting with each motion.</span></p><div class="pagination">
