I'll do anything!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian was on the brink of a mental breakdown, desperately pleading with Alexander, tears streaming down his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander couldn't help but chuckle at the sight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's with the waterworks, big guy? Crying crocodile tears, are we? You've probably killed dozens of people, and now you're worried about a little cash? Over a billion is quite a sum, though... Let's see that money!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a swift motion, Alexander released his grip on Sebastian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian felt a rush of relief; as long as he could keep his life, money was just a number, and he had far more than just that billion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Alexander received a notification on his phone confirming the transfer, a grin spread across his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah, money really is nice..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His cold gaze shifted back to Sebastian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian's heart raced. "You've got my money now; you can't kill me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, Alexander's </span><span>grabbed </span><span>Sebastian's throat like a hawk seizing its prey.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian gasped for air, clawing at Alexander's hand in a futile attempt to breathe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I...

Don't you want to be a good guy?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian thrashed wildly, like a fish out of water, his face shifting from pale to red, then to a sickly shade of blue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry, I'll keep my promise.

Monsters like you belong in hell, where you won't be bothering anyone else."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's words sent Sebastian into a final frenzy, but it was short-lived.

He had no desire to dirty his hands with such trash.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Turning away, he left the private room, and soon flames erupted behind him, reducing everything to ashes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>D</span><span>awn had broken.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Alexander returned to the villa, </span><span>Lara</span><span> was already gone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The faint scent of her lingering in the bedroom felt surreal, as if last night had been a dream.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lara</span><span> had actually become his woman; the thought was almost </span><span>out of imagination</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After </span><span>having a rest</span><span>, Alexander joined Ava for lunch, and they chatted for a while before reluctantly parting ways.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Betty and Augusta were waiting for Alexander's next orders.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nightfall Bar, serving as the temporary headquarters for Ultimate Alliance, was closed </span><span>to the public.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Alexander arrived, he could hear the sounds of shouting and fighting coming from inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Pushing the door open, he found the bar's booths and counter cleared out, leaving a large open space.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Twenty people were split into two groups, undergoing training from Augusta and Marvin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Logan, Charlize, and William were watching the scene unfold with interest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Boss!" they exclaimed, rushing over to greet him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Augusta stepped forward</span><span> and explained</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Boss, I picked these twenty from Billy's crew to train them properly.
