  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Boss, William is at your service!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">William dropped to one knee before Alexander, showing utmost respect.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander smiled with satisfaction. His efforts hadn't been in vain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"William, from now on you'll work for me. I'll treat you well."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The Force had completely influenced William's mind, making him absolutely trustworthy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Thank you, Boss! Truth is, I've been sick of the hitman life for a while. I'm incredibly grateful you're giving me a chance to start over."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">William was overcome with emotion, his eyes welling up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander's expression turned serious. "Who hired you to kill me? Was it my older brother or my second brother?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">William quickly replied, "It was one of your older brother's right-hand men, Nicholas Prescott! He put out a bounty of five million dollars on the Dark Web. I was the first to take the job.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Boss, if the bounty isn't removed, I'm afraid more hitmen will come after you!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A murderous glint flashed in William's eyes. "Why don't I just take care of Nicholas for you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Well... Haha!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander suddenly chuckled. Despite his bright smile, it sent chills down William's spine.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You're still recovering. Rest up. I'll handle this myself."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">William couldn't help but shudder. He figured Nicholas was in for a rough time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Boss, I've saved up nearly thirty million dollars in my years as a hitman. It's yours if you need it, no questions asked."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">William nervously eyed Alexander, worried Alexander might be upset, so he brought up the money.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander smiled slightly. The Force was impressive; William was genuinely loyal.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Thirty million dollars, huh? You've done well for yourself. But I won't use my subordinates' money. Keep it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">William finally let out a long sigh of relief at Alexander's words.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Boss, here's the address Nicholas gave me. He said to meet him there after the job's done."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">William pulled out his phone to show Alexander the message.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander's lips curled into a silent smile, sharp with deadly intent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'll deal with Nicholas myself. Go home and recover. I'll be in touch if I need you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes, boss."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">William bowed deeply to Alexander before turning to leave.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander then called Anne.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Ms. Hollister, send me the list of important figures in Loscity related to Augustine immediately."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Anne was startled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mr. Hawthorne, are we making a move? Should I gather everyone?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No need. Just send me the list."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander hung up without bothering to explain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">On the other end, Anne's pretty face was filled with shock and confusion. She wondered what Alexander was planning.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Soon after, Alexander received a message from Anne.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">[Betty Rowe, General Manager of The Brilliant Group's Loscity branch.]</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">[Nicholas Prescott, Deputy General Manager of The Brilliant Group's Loscity branch.]</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">[Daniel Walker, Head of Security at The Brilliant Group's Loscity branch.]</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander narrowed his eyes, muttering to himself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Augustine, my dear brother. I wanted to have a chat with you, but you've crossed me one too many times. Don't blame me for cutting off your cash flow in Loscity!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The Brilliant Group's headquarters were in Sandgo, rivaling the Saint Group as a multi-billion-dollar international conglomerate.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Augustine's real name was unknown to outsiders. Everyone called him by his alias, "Guzman".</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Guzman was shrouded in mystery. Some low-level folks said he was a modern-day Robin Hood, while others claimed he was a ruthless devil.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He controlled most of the drug trade in Mesco, even commanding his private militia.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Though Guzman was a wanted man in over a dozen countries, he was as slippery as an eel. He moved freely between Sandgo and Mesco under various identities, living large.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Guzman, I'll start by taking out your lackeys in Loscity!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander vanished into the depths of the night.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">*****</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the VIP room of the Magic Bar, chaos reigned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Women, stark naked, lay strewn across the floor, their expressions alluring yet dazed. On the couch, more women lounged their faces, a mix of temptation and confusion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The table was littered with fruit platters, liquor, cigarettes, and white powder scattered everywhere.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nicholas, a joint hanging from his lips, leered as he embraced a young beauty.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The girl couldn't have been more than eighteen or nineteen, with complete breasts, a pert behind, and skin was incredibly smooth and shiny.</p><div class="pagination">
