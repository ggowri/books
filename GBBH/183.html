  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Time seemed to slip away before Alexander finally opened his eyes, exhaling a long, drawn-out breath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To his astonishment, that breath shot out like an arrow, traveling six feet before dissipating into the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was momentarily dumbfounded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>According to the Ultimate Legacy, when a Warrior harnessed the Force and released it, it could strike like a true arrow, a technique they called the Force Breath. It was simply mind-blowing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sun was already high in the sky, and glancing at the clock, Alexander realized it was well past noon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was a knock on the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A cheerful voice rang out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, you okay in there?" It was Ava.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hurried to open the door, only to find Lara standing there too, and he froze for a moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava chimed in, "Lara wants to go shopping. Are you coming with us?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've got stuff to take care of. You two go ahead," Alexander replied, avoiding Lara's gaze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lara's eyes locked onto him with an intensity that felt inviting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why won't you look at me, Alexander? Are you shy?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could only manage a smile, feeling a bit flustered. "No way, Lara, you've got it all wrong."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, as long as that's the case. Since you and Ava are living together now, I'll be dropping by often. You won't mind, will you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her grin was sly, like that of a clever fox.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course not! You're always welcome!" Alexander replied, trying to brush it off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava couldn't help but laugh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lara, when did you become such a smooth talker? Stop teasing him; he's as honest as they come."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ha! Men are all about appearances. Who knows what they're really like underneath?" Lara shot back, her gaze lingering on Alexander's pants in a way that made him squirm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He chose to act oblivious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's get going; we're wasting time."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava led the way out, and as she stepped outside, Alexander playfully pinched Lara's rear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah!" she squeaked, her cheeks flushing a deep red.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He pulled her against the wall, kissing her fiercely, his hands roaming over her boobs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What... what are you doing? Ava's right outside!" Lara gasped, struggling weakly, breathless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ignoring her protests, Alexander indulged himself for a moment before pulling back with a grin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you're scared, why did you tease me earlier?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmph, I was just a little jealous," Lara said, shooting him a mock glare.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Outside, Ava called out, "Lara, what's taking you so long? Hurry up!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Coming!" Lara replied hurriedly, adjusting her slightly disheveled shirt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander gave her another playful slap on the backside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Next time, don't pull that stunt, or I might really make your behind sore."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a playful smirk, Lara let out a sultry giggle, giving his dick a light pinch as she dashed out the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ugh, beautiful women really are like foxes," Alexander mused to himself, shaking his head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thanks to Ava's easygoing nature, he found himself loosening up as well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Having sex with women had its perks, especially when it meant accelerating his mastery of James' Force. He no longer felt the need to resist; as long as both parties were willing, he had no burden on his shoulders.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feeling refreshed, Alexander reached out to Augusta to check on the investigation's progress.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Boss, I was just about to reach out to you! I spent a bit of cash, and I've got intel on </span><span>Treasure Island. It's just the surface stuff for now, though. That place is heavily fortified; not just anyone can get in... Guzman spends at least half of his time on the island each month."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Augusta detailed how he acquired the information and then sent the first-hand data over to Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a quick glance, Alexander asked, "Can you get me an identity to get in?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry about the cost. How long will it take?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sure thing, maximum three days!" Augusta replied confidently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's spirits soared; once he tracked down Guzman, he could rid himself of this persistent threat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Boss, I just got word&mdash;Logan was attacked by the Fraternity!" Augusta's voice quivered with urgency.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What? The Fraternity? Where? I'm on my way!" Alexander shot out the door, his eyes blazing with menace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the hospital, Alexander rushed straight to the surgical ward.</span></p><div class="pagination">
