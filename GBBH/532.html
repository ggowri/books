  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then Nancy leaned over to Brittany's ear and whispered something. Brittany looked shocked and opened her mouth in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Nancy, do you mean it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brittany didn't believe it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy nodded with a red face, and Brittany didn't know what to say.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She never expected that the secret treasure Nancy mentioned was the Kaylon Pill.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Kaylon Pill could greatly improve the user's physical fitness and eliminate the effects of generic drugs. It was a secret treasure passed down by the Kaylon thousands of years ago.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, to make the Kaylon Pill, in addition to some precious herbs, the virgin blood of the leader of the Kaylon was also needed. This blood must be shed when Nancy had sex with a man for the first time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It just so happened that Nancy was still a virgin, so this secret was unknown to outsiders.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander looked at Brittany expectantly, wanting to know what Nancy had just said to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brittany did not explain but kept whispering to Nancy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wow, why is there another beautiful lady here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She is so beautiful, no worse than Nancy, I like her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this time, many men in the bar noticed Brittany.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was a lot of discussion at the moment, and some very confident men were already eager to come over and chat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come on, let's sit inside."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To get rid of the entanglement, Nancy took Alexander and Brittany to the innermost window seat and sat down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was Nancy's exclusive seat. Several security guards stood around to isolate anyone who wanted to disturb her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander said patiently, "Please help me. If you can cure my daughter, you can ask for any conditions..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Really? Can I ask for anything I want?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy looked at Alexander playfully, with a hint of cunning and shyness in her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander nodded firmly and said, "As long as I can do it, I will agree."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How about giving me the potion formula?" Nancy looked at Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander hesitated for a moment and agreed without hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay, as long as you have a way to cure Ashley, I'll give you the formula."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although the potion could help him earn countless money, there was only one Ashley, who could be measured by money.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy looked at Alexander in surprise, with a hint of admiration in her eyes. She didn't expect that Alexander would agree.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Another man might not agree.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy remained silent, her pretty face blushing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander didn't know what she meant and looked at Brittany with a frown.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brittany sighed secretly, leaned close to Alexander's ear, and whispered, "The secret treasure that Nancy mentioned is the Kaylon Pill... It requires the blood she shed when she has sex with a man for the first time. So..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander rubbed his temples because of a headache.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Brittany, are you sure?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm sure that's what Nancy said just now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander made up his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, I'll give you the potion formula and you'll be my woman, how about that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy smiled contemptuously and said, "Do you think I'm so greedy? If I liked money, I would have had sex long ago. Besides, I'm the leader of the Kaylon. Are you richer than me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well... then what exactly do you want?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander looked helpless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy rolled her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm going to DJing, we can talk after I finish work."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She stood up and walked towards the stage without even glancing at Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brittany smiled bitterly and said, "Alexander, if you want to save Ashley, you have to please Nancy. But she is not short of money."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander muttered unhappily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If she doesn't want money, why did she ask for potion formulas? Who knows if the Kaylon Pill is useful..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brittany said with a serious expression, "The Kaylon Pill was passed down from the Kaylon thousands of years ago. I heard that it can cure all diseases except the dead."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is it really that magical? If it's true, even if she doesn't want to, I can just force her!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander slammed the table and said something shocking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brittany knew that Alexander was angry, so she shook her head with a wry smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, the atmosphere in the entire bar reached its climax and everyone started to go crazy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy was DJing and moving her sexy body to the music.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy did have a good figure, with plump breasts and a butt. Her skin was delicate and smooth, like the finest gem.</span></p><div class="pagination">
