  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Boss...you are so big..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosalia unconsciously licked her lips, a mix of anticipation and desire in her gaze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As one of the Red Umbrella Group's top Shadow Warriors, she had not indulged in sex for a long time. She, too, had her needs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Alexander had completely overpowered her, Rebecca felt an intense sense of admiration and obedience toward him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under the influence of a tranquilizing substance and seeing Alexander's excitement, she found herself unable to control her emotions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Ziiiip</span><span>!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosalia unzipped Alexander's pants and buried her head in there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander closed his eyes comfortably and felt a sense of conquest as he watched the beautiful woman willingly serve him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Ava was still sound asleep upstairs. She would throw a fit if she saw this scene.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's your real name?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosalia replied hesitantly, "Ro... Rosalia..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Overwhelmed, Alexander took control of the moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could recruit Rosalia as a subordinate or let her go, but her previous attempts at assassinating needed to be dealt with.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Take it slow, please..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosalia was visibly overwhelmed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's smile hinted at his confidence. "From now on, you live to serve me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though Rosalia's eyes welled with tears, she did not resist. She seemed to enjoy it even more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had never seen such a terrifying man before, who was not only powerful but also </span><span>dark. This kind of man had a deadly attraction to women.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander pinched her pair of ample peaks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry, as long as you behave, I will protect you and won't let anyone hurt you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosalia trembled slightly, a feeling of unprecedented security washing over her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She grew up in an orphanage, was adopted by the Red Umbrella Group from a young age, and trained to become an assassin, spending her life searching for a sense of safety.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The boss says he will protect me and won't let anyone hurt me; is this damned feeling of security really what it feels like?" she thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The powerful and dark man captivated Rosalia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I am willing to follow you forever. I shouldn't have come to assassinate you; please punish me severely!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosalia pleaded, her eyes filled with desire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander lifted her thighs, letting her straddle him, his hands full of her luscious flesh, smooth and delicate, making him drool.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Once you experience the ultimate pleasure, you will understand how wise it is to follow me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As her supple curves descended, Rosalia gasped, almost unable to breathe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander embraced the beautiful assassin who had delivered herself to him, lost in bliss.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thankfully, the villa had great soundproofing, and the sound of wind and rain outside completely masked Rosalia's cries of pleasure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was over an hour before the storm subsided.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosalia had completely surrendered, lying in Alexander's arms like a docile bird.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was not only subdued by Force Control but had also tasted a pleasure unlike any other, leaving only Alexander in her heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The wonderful sensations of repeated climax she experienced just moments ago were deeply etched into her bones, leaving her utterly addicted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander naturally enjoyed the cleaning service of the beautiful woman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosalia's oral skills were quite impressive, much to Alexander's satisfaction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Have you seen the chairman from the Red Umbrella Group? What does he look like? What's his name?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosalia shuddered, fear flashing in her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've seen him; his name is Felix Vanderbilt, he's just over thirty and very handsome... It's rumored he's not only the chairman from the Red Umbrella Group but also a member of the Vanderbilt family in Capital Region. His mother, Skyla Vanderbilt, is a high-ranking official in the Vanderbilt family..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander couldn't help but mutter to himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Vanderbilt family in Capital Region? They are a colossal power straddling both political and business realms, with assets exceeding hundreds of billions of dollars, and several high-ranking officials have emerged from the family, be it governors or senators, even military leaders."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No wonder the Red Umbrella Group can establish long-term cooperation with the </span><span>military and control powerful weapons like the 'power elixir'."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's expression darkened; this second brother was not only more treacherous and ruthless than Guzman but also had a background and influence that Guzman could not match.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Rebecca, you can't stay by my side for now. Go back and do your undercover work well; I will have use for you one day."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosalia frowned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But those two wizards escaped. They'll definitely report back to the Red Umbrella Group about what happened."</span></p><div class="pagination">
