  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Deep in the picturesque mountains of Mesco stood a wealthy estate, exuding grandeur and wealth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The property wasn't just a feast for the eyes with its natural beauty and melodious birdsong. It was a fortress bristling with security measures. For miles around, a web of guards and lookouts kept watch, complemented by cutting-edge satellite surveillance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was no exaggeration to say that not even a bird could fly in without the owner's permission.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Inside a uniquely decorated study, a tall, bronze-skinned man in his prime was blowing his top.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Surrounding him, over a dozen men and women of varied appearances stood with bowed heads, not daring to utter a peep.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Any outsider catching sight of this group would be floored.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Each person present was a big shot, capable of making entire cities in Mesco quake with just a word.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">They froze like deer in headlights, not daring to make a sound.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The man before them was Guzman, the kingpin of the Mesco drug cartel and chairman of the Brilliant Group.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Sebastian, has Theodore reached Loscity yet?" Guzman asked in a grave tone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Sebastian quickly replied, "Don't worry. Theodore's in Loscity and has started the operation. We should hear good news soon."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Guzman nodded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"We need to investigate Nicholas and Daniel's disappearance. If it wasn't The Kaylon, it must be the Saint Group. And we need to look into Betty. Why is she unharmed?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes, Guzman. Theodore took several of our best men. They'll definitely take out that punk Alexander and seize control of the Saint Group."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Excellent!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Guzman slammed his fist on the table with satisfaction.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The table vibrated, sending out a shockwave that made everyone's eardrums ache.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The group winced, wiping away cold sweat while gazing at Guzman with awe.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Guzman's eyes swept across the room as he fingered the small black doll hanging from his neck, grinning smugly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The voodoo doll crafted by the dark wizard was genuinely miraculous, boosting both his strength and speed by more than twofold.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Guzman even felt like he was getting younger, turning back the clock.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Guzman scoffed inwardly, "A mere bastard dares to challenge me for that position? What a pipe dream."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Everyone suddenly felt a terrifying, cold, murderous intent emanating from Guzman. Their backs broke out in cold sweat as they hurriedly made their excuses and left.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even Sebastian's face turned ashen.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It wasn't until he was far from the study that he finally breathed a long sigh of relief, feeling truly safe.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As Guzman's most trusted man, second only to the boss himself, his life was far from easy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Guzman's terrifying eyes seemed to be watching him every second of every day.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">*****</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The next day, at The Kaylon's headquarters in Loscity...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava personally came to visit Oscar to discuss alliance matters.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Oscar chuckled while brewing coffee.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Ms. Blackburn, as you can see, I'm in great shape. How could I possibly have Parkinson's?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava hadn't expected Oscar to hold a grudge against Alexander still.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Sir Stewart, my boyfriend, has mysterious abilities. I suggest you get a thorough check-up at the hospital."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Oscar sighed, "Ms. Blackburn, I really can't figure out what it is about Alexander that has you so obsessed. Why do you keep defending him?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava smiled sweetly, "Because he's my boyfriend, of course I trust him. Besides, he can actually help treat my angina."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At the mention of Alexander, Ava's eyes sparkled, and she couldn't help but smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Oscar, being experienced in these matters, could tell Ava had fallen for Alexander.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He snorted dismissively, "Ms. Blackburn, after I returned yesterday, I had someone thoroughly investigate Alexander's background."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"He spent five years as a loser for the Fairfax family, living like a dog. It wasn't until he met you that he started throwing his weight around.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If I'm not mistaken, the half a million dollars for his daughter Ashley's surgery came out of your pocket, didn't it, Ms. Blackburn?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"To put it bluntly, a man like that is nothing but dead weight!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Oscar finished with a sneer, his contempt obvious.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava felt a sudden surge of anger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She couldn't stand anyone trash-talking Alexander in front of her, always ready to defend him tooth and nail.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Time to give this old coot a piece of her mind!</p><div class="pagination">
