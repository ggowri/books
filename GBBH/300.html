  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The police cars and ambulances finally arrived, and Melin and Frank were taken to the ambulance. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dozens of police officers, led by Oliver, quickly assembled, accompanied by a SWAT team armed with heavy weapons. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Given the evidence Melin had captured on video, Oliver had no choice but to get involved in this major case, despite the risk of offending Schroder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Rest up. I'll make sure Rosen tells us everything," Alexander assured Melin, gently touching her cheek. Melin blushed, unable to meet his gaze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Frank, sobbing, pleaded, "Alexander, please save them. We let you down, and I'm truly sorry."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander sighed deeply and finally nodded. Despite his feelings toward the Fairfax family, he knew they didn't deserve to die. They had suffered enough and would likely stay out of trouble for a while.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, there's still no news about Jane and the others. Please, you have to save them," Frank urged.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry, Sir Fairfax. I'll make sure Ashley doesn't lose her mother," Alexander promised.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>---</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the police station, in the interrogation room, Rosen sat with a frown. The heavy door swung open, hitting the wall with a bang, startling him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander entered, carrying a black bag, with Oliver by his side. Oliver, expressionless, said, "Rosen, we've caught all your men. Mr. Hawthorne is here to question you. Cooperate to avoid unnecessary trouble." With that, he slammed the door shut and left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosen looked at Alexander in terror. "Stay away from me!" he shrank back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smirked, watching Rosen sweat with anxiety. "Tell me how Schroder ordered the kidnapping," he demanded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosen was just following orders and knew his testimony could implicate Schroder. "I won't say a word. Do whatever you want. General Flores will get me out of this," he retorted defiantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, you're going to hold out till the end?" Alexander asked, nodding slowly. He fixed Rosen with a cold stare. "Is it really worth it to risk your life for Schroder?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What are you going to do? This is a police station! Are you going to kill me here? Officer! He's going to kill me!" Rosen screamed in panic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander shook his head. "It's no use. Oliver and I have an understanding. No one will hear you, no matter how loud you scream."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He grabbed Rosen by the throat, lifting him off the ground. Rosen's cries were cut short, his face contorted in pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll ask one more time. Will you confess? If you don't give me what I need, I'll dislocate every joint in your body," Alexander warned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't you dare!" Rosen struggled desperately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's patience wore thin. Without Rosen's confession, they couldn't officially move against Schroder. He needed to dismantle Schroder's military backing first.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a surge of force, Alexander twisted Rosen's arms. A series of cracks echoed as Rosen's joints dislocated, his arms hanging uselessly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Was it Schroder who ordered the kidnapping?" Alexander pressed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes! My arms! Please, help me," Rosen cried out in agony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Where is Schroder's hideout?" Alexander demanded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't know," Rosen stammered, trembling and drenched in sweat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander grabbed Rosen's right leg, shaking it until it cracked.</span></p><div class="pagination">
