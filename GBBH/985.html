  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this time, Gavin raised his glass and loudly declared, "Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for attending my granddaughter's birthday party. I hope everyone has a pleasant evening. Cheers!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone raised their glasses in response.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As the wine was consumed, the previously tense atmosphere began to ease, and the lively chatter gradually returned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, the focus of the conversations remained on Asher and Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although Asher had suffered a major defeat tonight, everyone speculated that he would not let Alexander off so easily tomorrow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gavin, smiling warmly, turned to Alexander and said, "Alex, what are you going to do tomorrow? Grace has a fondness for you and is quite worried about you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Grace's face instantly turned red, and she lowered her head shyly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander glanced at Adam, then at the blushing Grace, unsure of what to say.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was clear that Gavin was promoting his granddaughter. Alexander was speechless. He thought, "Was it possible that the granddaughter of the second most powerful man in Avalora could not find a husband?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But after some thought, Alexander conceded that outstanding, capable young men like himself were indeed rare.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander thought for a while before saying, "Mr. Gavin Lawson, I think Miss Lawson is quite remarkable."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gavin immediately smiled with satisfaction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Grace, take good care of Alex. I have some matters to attend to. Alex, don't worry about tomorrow's situation. I will handle it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"By the way, I have some old friends coming to Loscity tomorrow to meet with me. They will also discuss the exclusive distribution rights for magic powder with you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander nodded with a polite smile. He said, "Thank you for your concern, Mr. Gavin Lawson. I will definitely not let them down."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gavin patted Alexander on the shoulder and said, "Very good, you are very broad-minded and understand that some profits should be shared. Your future is very bright."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Grace!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He gave Grace a meaningful look before leaving with Gale and Ave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ave was obviously a little unhappy, but now that Alexander had won Adam's favor, she didn't dare to say anything more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this time, Grace, smiling sweetly, turned to Madelyn and said, "Excuse me, I want to chat with Alexander alone."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Madelyn forced a smile and reluctantly left, glancing back at every step.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander sighed inwardly. Clearly, Grace was not simple-minded. With her status and family backing, Madelyn could not compete with her at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If Alexander had to choose between Grace and Madelyn, he would undoubtedly pick Grace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, the top priority in his heart was still Ava. Grace was merely a latecomer relying on the Lawson family's influence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Lost in thought, Alexander didn't say anything for a while.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Alexander, come with me. I want to show you a treasure. Let's appreciate it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Grace's face flushed as she gave him a gentle push.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander snapped out of his thoughts. "What treasure?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Come with me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Grace boldly grabbed Alexander's hand and led him toward a small lounge at the end of the corridor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Many guests noticed their movements. Seeing Grace take such initiative with Alexander, they could not help but sigh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone knew by now that Asher no longer had a chance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Grace led Alexander into the small lounge at the end of the corridor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Click!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She closed the door and locked it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander was curious. "What kind of treasure requires such caution?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Grace's face turned as red as an apple. Stammering, she said, "Alexander, you... you are so clueless..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her cheeks were flushed, her delicate eyebrows knit together, and her eyes brimming with charm as she stared directly at Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She looked like a tigress eyeing her prey, ready to devour him whole.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this time, Grace then reached behind her back and unzipped her gown.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The dress immediately fell to the floor, revealing her smooth, delicate body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her skin was snow-white like jade, her full chest rounded and firm, her waist slender, her hips slightly youthful, and her legs long and elegant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Alexander, I'm the treasure. Do you like what you see?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Grace said coyly, her voice dripping with seduction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander was speechless. He hadn't expected this bold young lady to dare to seduce him here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He was certain that Gavin had no idea his granddaughter was this audacious. Otherwise, he wouldn't have arranged for her to spend time with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In fact, Alexander had misunderstood Grace. Although she was bold, she was typically conservative.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was because she had accidentally witnessed her parents being intimate and felt a sense of urgency advance Asher's behavior that she dared to make such a move on Alexander.</span></p><div class="pagination">
