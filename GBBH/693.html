  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The speed wasn't slow at all. In fact, it was so blindingly fast that Rosalia's movements left afterimages in the air, creating an illusion of slow motion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Two swift slashes at the same spot, and Rosalia's blade tore through the combat exoskeleton.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The opponent's body split in two along with the exoskeleton, crashing heavily to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The exoskeleton's power cell ruptured, sparking and igniting in a massive explosion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The other two experts were engulfed in the fiery blast, their combat exoskeletons exploding in a chain reaction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A massive mushroom cloud erupted at the scene, sending devastating shockwaves in all directions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Red Umbrella Group members were blown to bits, scattering flesh and blood everywhere.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Like a ghost, Rosalia swiftly took cover behind a boulder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her face was pale, her body trembling uncontrollably. Those few strikes had clearly drained most of her energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet Rosalia felt incredibly refreshed, as if every cell in her body had been supercharged.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had always been a martial arts expert, and Alexander's magic circle had helped unlock her potential. Now, she had broken through to a level surpassing even level-three metahuman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just how many tiers she could go toe to toe with would need to be tested in actual combat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, two survivors from the Red Umbrella Group emerged from the edge of the blast zone and took off running.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though they had barely escaped death, the explosion's aftermath had left them covered in soot, their clothes in tatters, and bleeding from various wounds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Trying to run?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Two flashes of razor-sharp light pierced through their hearts with deadly precision.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Heh."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosalia's beautiful eyes glinted with murderous intent as she sneered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander approached, clapping his hands with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Less than two minutes. Impressive. I'm pleased."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's all thanks to your training, Sir!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosalia and Charlize bowed their heads respectfully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smiled. "Come, let's join Augusta."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Several minutes later, Alexander arrived with Rosalia and Charlize at Augusta's position.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The buildings, just over half a mile from the Red </span><span>Umbrella Group's plaza</span><span>, had been converted into forward operating bases.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Five hundred elite Ultimate Alliance fighters stood ready for battle. At the same time, Cloe commanded over a thousand Brilliant Group members to form a perimeter, ensuring no Red Umbrella Group members could escape after their defeat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not only had Augusta awakened her werewolf bloodline, but William had also undergone a massive transformation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Through dedicated practice of Alexander's meditation techniques, he had awakened his vampire bloodline.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While William couldn't match Augusta in raw combat power, he possessed the ability to control thousands of vampire bats simultaneously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These bats had been hiding in the island's dense jungles and dark underground caverns until William summoned them, forming a terrifying army of winged creatures.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as Alexander appeared, Augusta and William rushed out with their subordinates to greet him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosalia and Charlize looked at them in surprise, noticing that Augusta and William's auras were just as powerful as their own.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>William squinted, sneaking a few glances at Rosalia and Charlize before quickly lowering his head, not daring to look longer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ever since awakening his vampire bloodline, his resistance to beautiful women drastically decreased, and he found himself having inappropriate thoughts about Rosalia and Charlize.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the moment he remembered they were Alexander's </span><span>women,</span><span> he straightened up and kept his eyes down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander gave a faint smile, fully aware of William's thoughts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>William was already under Force Control, with a trace of the Force lurking in his mind. All Alexander had to do was think about it, and William would be in agony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, no matter how strong William became, he wouldn't dare betray Alexander. Betrayal would only lead to his doom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Here, I brought you some protective talismans. They'll shield you from magical damage for a while," Alexander said, pulling out several jewel talismans.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you, Sir!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Augusta and William exclaimed excitedly, taking the jeweled necklaces from Alexander's hand and carefully putting them on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander then used his All-seeing Eyes to examine William, discovering a crimson energy inside his body, redder than blood itself. It must be William's awakened vampire bloodline.</span></p><div class="pagination">
