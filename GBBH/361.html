  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander chuckled to himself, feeling a surge of triumph.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No matter how rich or powerful a man might be, not being able to make a woman surrender to him in bed was a huge regret.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You like it that much? I'll make sure you have it often," Alexander teased with a grin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Mmm</span><span>! I only want yours, Boss. I'm not touching any other </span><span>man's</span><span>. There must be tons of women after you, but you better keep me at the top of the list," Cloe responded with a satisfied smirk.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cloe savored the moment, making a sound of satisfaction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smiled, thinking that women from powerful families really were different. They understood that a strong man was never just one woman alone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After she was done, Cloe licked her lips, nestled into Alexander's arms, and soon drifted off to sleep.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander closed his eyes, seeming to rest, but focused on refining and absorbing the Force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cloe was also pure, which helped Alexander absorb James' Force more, stirring a powerful surge within him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was both surprised and thrilled. Was he about to advance to an </span><span>Intermediate Warrior?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Boom!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, a thunderous roar exploded in his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander felt his soul power double as a powerful mental force erupted silently and extended outward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was as if he'd unlocked supernatural vision, able to see everything within a thousand-meter radius with crystal clarity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Outside, it was already late at night. Streetlights lit up, and the revelers outside were making a ruckus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though he was hundreds of miles away, Alexander could hear their conversations and see their expressions and gestures clearly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he wanted, Alexander could even see and hear the insects jumping and chirping in the forest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was exhilarated, almost feeling like a god at that moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Huh!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was suddenly surprised; a thousand miles away, he noticed a few dark figures near the edge of a cliff.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a narrow path along the cliff, where pale moonlight filtered through the leaves, casting shadows.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Along with the jingling of bells, several headless figures in black robes shuffled down the path.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These headless figures moved slowly and stiffly, step by step.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Alexander was still lying on the bed, he squinted instinctively, making his view even clearer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He saw a tall figure in a black robe holding a silver bell, chanting softly while shaking the bell to drive the headless ones forward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jingle, jingle...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The headless ones moved in sync, stiffly marching toward a castle at the cliff's edge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though he was over a thousand miles away, Alexander's powerful mental force allowed him to smell the thick stench of decay wafting along the path.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clearly, those headless figures were the missing corpses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The one leading with the bell was, without a doubt, the infamous corpse mage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They gradually entered the castle, and the heavy iron door shut tight as Alexander's mental power reached its limit and could no longer extend further.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not knowing what that castle was exactly, Alexander didn't want to act rashly for now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What he needed now was to solidify his level and get used to his All-seeing Eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander had miraculously broken through his limits, advancing to an Intermediate Warrior and gaining this extraordinary vision.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Force energy James had left in his body was only halfway absorbed, leaving Alexander thrilled and amazed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The power of desire was indeed boundless. The women provided him with great support. No wonder Corrupted Warrior advanced faster than regular warriors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had decided that tomorrow morning, he would head to the castle to get to the bottom of things.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next day, a light drizzle began to fall, and a refreshing sea breeze blew in, making for a pleasant morning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander stood not far from the castle, his hands behind his back. His deep-set eyes flashed with a strange light as he looked directly into some of the scenes within.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cloe spoke softly, "Boss, this castle has been here for over three hundred years, owned by the Rogers family. When Guzman first landed on the island, he marked the area around it as a restricted zone, not allowing anyone else to approach."</span></p><div class="pagination">
