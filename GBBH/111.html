  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felicity thought to herself, "This Mr. Gellar must be at least twenty years older than me. He's skinny, ugly, and downright sleazy."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I have to go," she finally snapped, unable to hold back any longer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felicity stood up, ready to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Andrew grabbed her arm, his fatherly authority on full display.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Felicity, we're doing this for your own good. If you get involved with Mr. Gellar, the Fairfax family will have a shot at success.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The magic powder he developed is a goldmine, and he's bound to be one of the wealthiest men around. You can't let this opportunity slip away."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Belinda chimed in, trying to reinforce their point.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Felicity, we would never steer you wrong. Just look at your sister&mdash;she chased after love and ended up with Alexander, who only brought her misery. You can't afford to be as reckless as she was. Mr. Gellar is a solid man."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felicity felt like she was about to explode.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jackson's leering gaze was glued to her chest, making her feel as if she had stepped in something foul.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you want to cozy up to him, why don't you do it yourselves? Why drag me into this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she attempted to push past Jane, her sister blocked her way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Felicity, we're all looking out for you! Why can't you see that? You should be grateful instead of acting like we're out to get you. I've been through it all; finding a man means finding one with money and status. You can't fall for someone like Alexander&mdash;he's trash.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"With the way magic powder is taking off, Mr. Gellar could be making hundreds of millions a month. If he expands it nationwide, he might just become the </span><span>most wealthy</span><span> man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"With his kind of appeal, he could have any woman he wanted. Why do you look so unhappy? Are you feeling slighted?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane's relentless lecture was almost suffocating, as if she wanted to force her beliefs into Felicity's mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jackson, smug as ever, added, "Hundreds of millions? That's just the tip of the iceberg!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I developed magic powder in just half a month and already made 500 million dollars. And that's just from </span><span>Loscity</span><span>."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wow! That much?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane and the others gawked at Jackson, their faces filled with awe and envy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Felicity, did you hear that? With Mr. Gellar's talent, those big stars and supermodels would be lining up for him. How can you not see the opportunity right in front of you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felicity felt her blood boil at Jane's words, her chest tightening with anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She could almost picture herself slapping this shameless woman across the face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Andrew shoved Felicity again, his voice rising in desperation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Felicity, your grandfather and I worked our butts off for decades to build nearly 100 million in wealth. But thanks to Alexander and the mess he made with the Saint Group, many partners have turned their backs on us, and our assets have shrunk to just 50 million.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Gellar is younger than me, yet he's raking in 500 million in just two weeks! That's the difference between us.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you get involved with him, our family will take off, and we'll all enjoy the fruits of </span><span>your success!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing that the Fairfax family still had 50 million in assets sparked a sinister grin on Jackson's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felicity replied firmly, "I won't be with him. If I'm looking for a boyfriend, it'll be someone like Alexander&mdash;kind and genuine."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane jumped </span><span>up,</span><span> her face twisted with rage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What do you mean? You actually like Alexander?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felicity stood her ground. "Jane, you're divorced from him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Can't I even mention his name? I've always wanted someone like him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a fit of anger, Jane slapped Felicity across the face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>He's</span><span> my ex-husband! You have no right to mention him, let alone like him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felicity held her cheek, tears streaming down her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Belinda rushed to her side, pleading, "Felicity, please don't be foolish. A good marriage can change your fate. Don't end up like your sister, who suffered so much because of Alexander."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Andrew, in a dramatic display, broke down, tears and snot running down his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What have I done to deserve this? That bastard Alexander beat me up like this, and you still like him? Have you lost your mind?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felicity was at a loss for words. The people who were supposed to support her were now persisting in their unreasonable behavior towards her.</span></p><div class="pagination">
