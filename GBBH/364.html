  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Henry lunged at Cloe, kissing and pawing at her like a madman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander shouted, channeling the Force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instantly, an invisible sound wave crashed over Cloe and Henry like a tidal wave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A buzzing, thunderous sound echoed down the hallway.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Targeted by the sound wave, Henry clutched his head in agony as if struck by lightning and quickly released Cloe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cloe, thankfully unaffected, smartly ducked behind Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who dares meddle in my business? You're dead!" Henry shouted, enraged.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Henry whipped around, his eyes blazing with a wolf-like, green intensity as he glared at Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, he muttered under his breath, "Ignorant sinner, punishment awaits you. Descend to hell...may you be bound there forever, tortured by eternal flames!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once debonair, Henry now seemed utterly transformed, like a beast from hell unleashed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For a moment, Alexander's vision went dark, and even breathing felt labored.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He heard shrieking wails, and a sulfuric stench filled the air as if hellfire were about to engulf him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's eyes flashed as he activated his Force Control and All-seeing Eyes, meeting Henry's gaze head-on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instantly, they both froze, locked in place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava stood there, confused, glancing between Henry and Alexander. Something was off with both of them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Henry's expression grew darker by the second. He hadn't expected anyone to withstand his sorcery, let alone surpass it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, in a flash!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's sharp gaze turned blood-red, piercing through Henry like a knife.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was pure psychological domination, more terrifying than any physical fight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Ahhh</span><span>!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Henry screamed in agony, clutching his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blood-red tears seeped between his fingers, dripping to the floor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His sorcery was met with such a powerful counterforce that his eyes couldn't withstand it, and they ruptured. He was now blind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All of this happened in mere seconds. Henry, who moments ago was riding high, was now severely wounded and blind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who are you? Who the hell are you? How could someone like you exist, unaffected by sorcery...This can't be real!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Henry roared in fury, then turned and sprinted madly down the hallway.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite his blindness, he moved quickly, sprinting at full speed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Trying to escape?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander stomped down, propelling himself forward like a shot arrow with his Force Control.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Henry started running first, Alexander's speed was even greater; he was closing in fast.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Henry dove into the room at the end of the hallway, his blindness still allowing him to sense direction and distance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His sorcery had reached such an advanced level that he could perceive his surroundings with mental energy alone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This only strengthened Alexander's resolve. He had to eliminate Henry. Left unchecked, he would surely rise to become a white wizard of the highest order.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hiding in the room, Henry's face twisted in agony as blood trickled from his eye sockets.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You bastard, you'll pay for this! Think you can just take me down because I'm blind?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hahaha...Now you'll see my true power!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander gave a cold laugh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Cut the talk. Let's see this 'true power' of yours. Isn't it just a bit of corpse manipulation?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What! How do you know about corpse manipulation?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Henry looked stunned, horrified.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With his secret revealed, he broke into a cold sweat, goosebumps prickling over his skin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ding-a-ling..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Henry took out a silver bell and shook it in a specific, practiced motion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Neither of them spoke, and only the eerie chime of the bell echoed in the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bang!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, the wall beside them shattered, sending bricks flying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Around a dozen shadowy figures burst through, each cloaked in black robes and headless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though their movements were stiff, these headless figures moved at an alarming speed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These were corpses controlled by Henry's corpse manipulation technique, and there were even more of them in the room.</span></p><div class="pagination">
