  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marvin and Shadow remained on guard, ready to strike at any moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aside from the tension brought by the ninja, there was also a middle-aged man in a gray suit and a young woman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man and woman had an aura just as intimidating as the ninja.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both sides stopped at a moderate distance, staring each other down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even from several meters apart, Marvin and Shadow could feel the cold, merciless killing intent radiating from their opponents.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Cyrus and Edmund are keeping one occupied outside. Let's take care of these two first," the man in the suit said with a sinister chuckle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man in the suit stepped forward slowly, his chilling words making Marvin and Shadow's eyes widen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before arriving, Alexander had shown them photos of the Mafia branch leader. It was him&mdash;Locke!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This man was incredibly powerful, no wonder the Godfather trusted him to establish a branch in </span><span>Risun</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for the woman, she was cloaked in a black robe, standing among the dense shadows of the trees, her figure almost completely obscured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Be careful!" Shadow warned Marvin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After cautioning Marvin, Shadow ignored Locke and the woman, focusing intently on </span><span>the ninja in black.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two locked eyes and slowly moved closer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their movements were eerily similar, even their breathing matched in rhythm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both moved silently, blending seamlessly into their surroundings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The ninja unsheathed two katanas, their gleaming blades cutting through the darkness in a chilling display.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shadow held a dagger in his left hand and a compact submachine gun in his right, glaring at the ninja with pure hatred.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The ninja returned the glare, his eyes filled with a predatory intensity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Locke showed no intention of attacking Marvin right away. Instead, he watched the fight between the ninja and Shadow with a smug smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clearly, he believed victory was already in his grasp and had nothing to fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marvin didn't let his guard down for a second, keeping an eye on Shadow while watching Locke and the strange woman out of the corner of his eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shadow and the ninja were both extremely skilled assassins.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their breathing, movements, and even the look in their eyes indicated they were cut from the same cloth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These were unique techniques only top-tier assassins could master, allowing them to conceal their killing intent and blend into their surroundings completely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even experienced fighters would struggle to detect them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bang, bang, bang!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shadow was the first to attack, his submachine gun spitting fire as he aimed at the ninja.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even with just one gun, his controlled bursts created a web of bullets that seemed inescapable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The ninja's front, back, and sides were completely covered by the gunfire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But as soon as Shadow pulled the trigger, the ninja moved like lightning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The spot where he had been standing was riddled with bullet holes, each spaced so evenly it looked meticulously planned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bang, bang, bang!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shadow kept firing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The bullets chased after the ninja until he slipped behind a large banyan tree, where Shadow finally ceased fire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Two drops of blood stained the ground, proof that the ninja had been grazed by a bullet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As skilled as he was, he couldn't completely evade Shadow's precise calculations.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I know who you are&mdash;you're Shadow!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Locke, who had been watching from the side, was stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only now did he realize Shadow's identity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, what a surprise. I was planning to take you out, but you came straight to me," Locke said with a smirk.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After his initial shock, Locke's expression shifted to one of eager anticipation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Should I step in and help Flame?" the woman asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her voice was mechanical and ice-cold, sounding more like a machine than a living person.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No need. Flame is the Mafia's best assassin. He and Shadow are archrivals&mdash;it's fitting for them to settle this once and for all," Locke replied with a grin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The ninja in black seemed offended by her offer to help and shouted angrily,</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"None of you interfere! Today, only one of us will walk away alive!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as he finished speaking, he vanished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Clang!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shadow swung his dagger behind him, blocking the attack with a piercing clash of metal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The katana in the flames was only four inches away from the back of his head, but it was firmly blocked by the dagger.</span></p><div class="pagination">
