  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was a clanking sound.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bruno was shirtless, holding the machete on the blue flame with the iron pincers of his left hand, and swinging the hammer with his right hand to forge it continuously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After the broken machete was molten, he joined it to a piece of steel. Then, he forged it into a complete machete.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, I mixed it with tungsten steel this time. I'll see how you can still break my machete!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bruno sneered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This machete had been with Bruno for over twenty years. He had a deep affection for it and was not willing to just abandon it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A truly formidable person would not change their weapons, because the feel of the weapon was </span><span>unique</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A familiar weapon could definitely make the user much more powerful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, I'll kill you when I fix the machete!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ava, I'm going to make you come to your senses and see Alexander, the asshole, for what he really is. You'll realize who's genuinely doing you good when the time comes."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bruno muttered to himself, ferocity showing in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The tungsten steel was so hard that Bruno had to take a break to regain his strength after hammering only a dozen times.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After hammering for over a hundred times, Bruno began to pant. His physical strength was overexerted, so he looked pale. It was truly hard to repair the machete with tungsten steel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Bruno was absolutely confident that once he finished tinkering with the machete, he would kill Alexander and get Ava.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, his cell phone rang.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's going on?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bruno asked angrily when he answered it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brandon on the other side of the cell phone was silent for a while before he took a deep breath and asked with a straight face, "Are you done with your mission?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bruno sneered and said in anger, "I've fought Alexander. He's truly impressive, and he broke my machete, but don't worry. When I fix my machete, I can definitely cut off his head!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Good. Bruno, you must finish the mission. This concerns your mother's future and whether you will feel elated."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brandon's voice on the other side of the phone became much softer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bruno could feel that Brandon, as his elder, the Godfather of the Mafia, didn't genuinely care about him but wanted him to be a loyal dog through the phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bruno replied coldly, "Don't worry. I'll do it when I'm sure."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay. I'll wait for your good news."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brandon was quite satisfied and nodded with a smile. "As long as you complete the mission, I certainly won't treat you poorly."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After hanging up the phone, Bruno sneered and threw the phone aside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was going to kill Alexander not for the sake of the Mafia and Brandon but for himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bruno hated the Mafia and despised Brandon, but he had to fulfill his mother's dying wish.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Also, he was in love with Ava, and he had to make sure that Ava got rid of Alexander!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bruno grabbed the hammer and started forging hard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was at the Saint Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava frowned, "The plague has been raging lately, and our group had to have a vacation all together. I heard that the city is going to be locked down today, and it will definitely affect our business."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander wasn't surprised at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I already have a way to get rid of the plague. Follow my recipe and ask someone to send over the herbs, and I will create the antidote.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then, I will put the antidote powder into the water plant's reservoir. People will simply drink the antidote water to remove the poison from their bodies and regain their health."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava was shocked. "You are such a hero!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She excitedly jumped into Alexander's arms and hugged him tightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two hugged for a while before immediately starting to take action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, Loscity, once a thriving paradise, had become a hell on earth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the terrible plague spreading wildly, it had become everyone's wish not to be infected and to survive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In Loscity Hospital, where the situation was most serious, both the halls and the corridors had been filled with hospital beds, lying with dying infected people.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were no beds for many of the patients, so they had to cower in the corners, some coughing violently, others convulsing all over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In front of the hospital, Melin was standing guard, her pretty face looking haggard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She truly hadn't expected the terrible plague to spread so quickly, and the situation had worsened in just one night.</span></p><div class="pagination">
