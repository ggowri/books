  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alyssa was panting, barely enduring it all, her plump breasts jumping back and forth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the end, Alyssa collapsed on the sofa without any strength left and could only allow Alexander to bully her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not knowing how long it </span><span>took,</span><span> Alexander finally couldn't bear it anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He pressed his penis against Alyssa's red lips directly, and the seminal fluid almost made Alyssa vomit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, everything was over. Alyssa savored the strange taste in her mouth, panting and complaining.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you trying to suffocate me? No man ever dared to make me drink his seminal fluid."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smiled and patted her plump butt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Others don't dare, but I do!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alyssa pouted and slipped into Alexander's arms, hugging him tightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No man had ever conquered her body and mind like this. Alyssa wished she could keep Alexander in Mandale Town forever.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"After defeating Paxton, can you stay here with me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alyssa still couldn't help but ask.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smiled and said, "I am the chairman of the Saint Group in Loscity, and I have occupied Treasure Island. Do you think I can stay here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alyssa exclaimed as if she met Alexander for the first time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was very satisfied with Alyssa's shock and pinched her breasts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Although I can't stay here with you, I want to become a shareholder of the Axe. I need a lot of high-level gems. You can think about it carefully!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After finishing speaking, Alexander picked up the document and continued to read.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He flipped through the pages very quickly, without pausing or thinking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alyssa stood there in a daze, obviously weighing how much of the Axe's shares Alexander should own.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>More than ten minutes passed, Alexander had already memorized all the key information and threw the information aside with confidence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You finished reading it so quickly?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alyssa was shocked again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, I've finished reading it, and I've chosen my first target."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander answered straightforwardly, which made Alyssa's heart beat wildly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What a monster!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was the thought that popped into Alyssa's mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get ready. Once it gets dark, I will start with the Glory Association and kill their leader first. Once there is chaos, you can rush in and swallow up the Glory Association."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander spoke calmly, as if he was not going to assassinate the leader of a hostile force but just going to shop in the supermarket.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You should have a good rest first. Then we can have some fun."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander slapped Alyssa on the butt and left the meeting room directly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alyssa blushed and quickly tidied her clothes, fearing that her men would see her like this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander went back to meet Alice and Xavier, and they were very excited after hearing Alexander's plan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It would be very beneficial if they could acquire shares in the Axe and then support the Axe to unify Mandale Town.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alyssa had issued an order for all elite troops to prepare for battle and be ready to attack at any time at night.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By the evening, when everything was arranged, Alyssa came to see Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander, Alice, and Xavier were chatting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Alyssa, Alice quickly stood up with a smile and said, "How is the arrangement going?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alyssa smiled sweetly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Everything has been arranged. Fortunately, I met you this time, otherwise the Axe </span><span>would be in trouble. As long as the plan goes smoothly, the Axe will be the largest gang in Mandale Town in the future!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was full of confidence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry, I will kill all four of them, Paxton from the Mafia, Jagger from the Glory Association, Beverly from the Weaver family, and Barton from Southern Mining!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alyssa was shocked and had mixed emotions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She knew Alexander was powerful, but Alyssa still felt it was a bit unrealistic to think he could kill the bosses of these four major forces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alyssa planned that it would already be a great success if Alexander could kill one or two of them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the evening, Alexander </span><span>drove</span><span> away from the Axe's headquarters in a black BMW.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as the car came out, the men Paxton arranged to monitor immediately spotted Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, Paxton was hugging a naked woman, and the two were frantically having sex.</span></p><div class="pagination">
