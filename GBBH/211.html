  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aiden, the head of the Ulysses family, had always wanted to take Phoenix Gemstone Establishment as part of the Ulysses family's property. However, it was founded by Xavier's deceased father, so of course they would keep it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander looked at the hundreds of small vendors and said with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Maybe there will be something good. But you just can't see it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Xavier said angrily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm not good at appraising treasures, but Phoenix Gemstone Establishment is definitely the best on this street. There are too many scammers here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander didn't say anything else, but walked leisurely on the street.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had the Force and could use Force Sense to discover the authenticity and grade of the gems.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Xavier said, almost all the vendors here were scammers. More than 90% of the gems were fake. Even if there were some real gems, the quality was very poor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander couldn't help feeling a little disappointed. Just when he was about to go to Phoenix Gemstone Establishment, he suddenly noticed a lonely vendor at the corner.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Other vendors had a wide variety of items on sale, but this vendor only had a few.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One of the earthy yellow stones attracted Alexander's attention.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This stone was like a clod, dull yellow with no luster. But Alexander felt it was very special.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander hurried over, picked up the stone and studied it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He used the Force Sense to carefully explore it and was surprised. It turned out to be another top-grade yellow gemstone, but it was covered with a layer of earth-colored rock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He pretended not to care and asked, "How much does this stone cost?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The vendor glanced at Alexander, as if observing his expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing that Alexander was very calm, the vendor said weakly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ten thousand dollars!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Xavier couldn't help but be angry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fuck! How dare you sell this stone for ten thousand dollars? Believe it or not, I will beat you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The vendor glared at Xavier and said unhappily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You asked me how much I want to sell it for. You don't have to buy it. You are so rude. If you can't afford it, just leave. It's a treasure. This is already a low price."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How dare you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Xavier was about to beat the vendor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Calm down!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander grabbed Xavier and shook his head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It is indeed expensive. I didn't want to buy it at first. But you are mean. I can afford it. I'll buy it for the price."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander said with determination.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The vendor was overjoyed. His method of provoking the customer worked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He immediately changed his expression. "You are an expert in knowing the goods. Please transfer the money, and I will pack it for you immediately."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander sneered secretly. The cunning vendor would never know that such a top-quality gem was worth at least tens of millions of dollars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Xavier wanted to persuade Alexander, but Alexander paid the money regardless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing this, Xavier could only sigh helplessly. Even someone as smart as Alexander had been fooled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The vendor was about to hand it to Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wait!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A young woman rushed over and snatched the gem away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll buy it at double the price."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The woman was probably in her early twenties, with heavy makeup on her face and a look of arrogance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And she was followed by two bodyguards should not be an ordinary person.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander said unhappily, "Miss, I have already paid for it. Do you want to steal my things?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The woman glanced at Alexander with contempt, then looked at Xavier next to her and said in a provocative tone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can return the money to you. Since you are Xavier's friend, I won't allow you to buy anything here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Xavier said angrily, "Angelica, what do you want?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angelica sneered with disdain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I just hate you, so I don't want you to buy things here. What's wrong?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander asked Xavier, "Do you know her?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Xavier said helplessly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Angelica, the daughter of Aiden, has always been spoiled and willful. They all want to take over the jewelry store founded by my father. Our relationship is not good."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander understood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Ulysses, please return the stone to me. Otherwise, I'll be rude."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's voice was cold and frightening.</span></p><div class="pagination">
