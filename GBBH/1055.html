  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The three of them </span><span>took</span><span> a taxi and went to Aetheris Street. On the way, Alexander asked Ariella about the Obsidian Gang.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ariella's father had passed away not long after he had a sudden illness. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ariella thought about it carefully and guessed that Chase was the </span><span>jerk</span><span> who had caused </span><span>her father's death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ariella's father died suddenly, so Ariella's foundation in the Obsidian Gang was unstable. Chase took this opportunity to unite some </span><span>members</span><span> and forcibly took control of the Obsidian Gang.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Ariella wanted to </span><span>strike back</span><span>, she found herself poisoned and couldn't exert her full strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the help of several loyal subordinates of her father, Ariella managed to escape</span><span> </span><span>and hide in a bar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The owner of that bar was a big shot in Aetheris Street, so those </span><span>guys working for Chase</span><span> in the Obsidian Gang dared not act rashly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tonight, a group of people from the Obsidian Gang kidnapped Ariella while she was unguarded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's the whole story. Thanks to my father's several loyal subordinates. Otherwise, I would have died," Ariella sighed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander, Ariella, and Rosalia got out of the taxi, crossed a narrow and dark side street, and came to the door of a small building.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The house was Ariella's residence. Ariella rang the doorbell.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, the door opened. The man looked </span><span>scared and nervous</span><span>. His eyes were full of horror, and he blinked desperately at Ariella.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander pulled Ariella behind him</span><span> at once</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't move! Or I'll kill you!" A </span><span>guy</span><span> behind th</span><span>at</span><span> man held two guns and pointed them at Ariella and Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Th</span><span>is guy's </span><span>hands were very stable, and his voice was cold. He was obviously an experienced killer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smiled without resistance. When Rosalia wanted to fight back, Alexander held her hand and stopped her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The door opened. Several robust men in black rushed out, pointed at Alexander, Ariella, and Rosalia with their guns, and took them into the house.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was a strong blood smell in the house, and there were three </span><span>dead </span><span>bodies on the floor, all covered with blood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Some bullet shells were scattered on the floor, and bullet holes could be seen everywhere in the house. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Obviously, a fierce gun battle had just happened here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only one person who had been assigned to protect Ariella was alive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander looked at the middle-aged man sitting on the sofa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man was Gore Booth. He was dressed in a black suit. There was a wolf head tattoo on his right cheek. Gore's blue eyes were malicious, staring at Alexander, Ariella, and Rosalia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were four bodyguards in black suits behind Gore. They had sharp eyes and exuded an aggressive presence. They were definitely tough enemies, staring at Alexander maliciously as if they were going to kill him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In addition, two men with submachine guns in their hands still stood behind Alexander, Ariella, and Rosalia, ready to shoot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gore stared at Ariella with cold eyes, looking like a wolf staring at its prey.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He crossed his legs and said in a hoarse, low voice, "Ariella, I didn't expect you to have partners. It's not easy for you to escape from Chase's control. If I'm not mistaken, these two guys helped you, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ariella glared at Gore and </span><span>shouted</span><span>, "Gore, you colluded with Chase</span><span>! </span><span>My father trusted you the most</span><span>! </span><span>You must have poisoned him! I swear I will kill you and avenge my father!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ariella turned to tell Alexander, "Alexander, this is Gore Booth I mentioned. He used to be my dad's most trusted subordinate. Only he c</span><span>ould</span><span> get close to my dad and poison him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, I'll make him pay </span><span>a high</span><span> price he deserves." Alexander nodded with some contempt in his calm expression, indicating that he didn't take Gore </span><span>seriously</span><span> at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You are courting death!" Gore lost his temper and kicked the table over with one foot. Then, he held a pistol and strode towards Ariella combatively.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, a sharp light flashed. Rosalia had already taken action. Before the two guys with submachine guns could react, their necks had been cut. They collapsed to the floor and died.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gore raised his pistol and wanted to shoot, but Alexander grabbed his wrist and broke it, forcing Gore to point the pistol at himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, the&nbsp;gun was fired. Gore was shot in the stomach, and blood gushed out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All this happened in a moment, and the situation reversed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Except for the four bodyguards who hadn't come to their senses yet, everyone else fell.</span></p><div class="pagination">
