  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felicity couldn't help but roll her eyes. She was just back from college, and her parents were already dragging her into a meeting with this so-called Mr. Gellar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She glanced at their eager faces, which were filled with a desperate desire for status, and felt a surge of frustration welling up inside her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The last thing Felicity wanted was to meet some stranger, let alone entertain the idea of being with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But under her parents' relentless pressure, Felicity had no choice but to play along.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for the magic powder and all the riches it could supposedly bring to the Fairfax family, she couldn't care less.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Felicity were to find a boyfriend, her mind would instinctively wander back to Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She mused, "I wonder how he's doing after his divorce from Jane. We barely see each other, but I always thought Alexander was a genuinely good guy&mdash;caring, simple, and kind-hearted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I still can't believe Jane left him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, Felicity's heart skipped a beat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Did I just </span><span>caught</span><span> a glimpse of Alexander in the VIP passage?" It was fleeting, but it felt real.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She turned to her parents, but they were oblivious. So, Felicity thought she was just imagining things.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felicity was gnawing on her lower lip, her mind racing with questions about this so-called Mr. Gellar. "Who exactly is he? What does he want?" She couldn't shake the feeling that something wasn't quite right.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After what felt like an eternity of waiting and checking their reservation numbers, they were finally ushered into the Astral Bistro.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Andrew, puffing out his chest with pride, declared, "Even though Mr. Gellar booked a basic private room, the minimum spend is over 10 thousand, not including tips that can easily hit a thousand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This isn't for just anyone!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Belinda nodded enthusiastically. "Exactly! It shows Mr. Gellar really values our Felicity."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felicity couldn't hide her disdain as she rolled her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inside the private room, they were greeted by a man in his forties&mdash;thin, with sunken cheeks and dark circles under his eyes that spoke of sleepless nights. His greasy complexion added to the overall unpleasant vibe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane was sitting with him, chatting animatedly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Andrew and Belinda entered, the man merely nodded arrogantly without </span><span>bothering to stand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the moment Felicity stepped in, his demeanor changed; he leaped to his feet, eyes glued to her as if she were a prized possession.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was undeniable&mdash;Felicity was stunning. With her youthful beauty and alluring figure, she outshone her sister Jane.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane frowned, clearly irritated. "Mom, Dad, you're late! Mr. Gellar has been waiting for quite a while."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jackson waved his hand dismissively.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey, we're all family here. No big deal. I'm just a down-to-earth guy."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane quickly pointed to Felicity, eager to impress. "Mr. Gellar, this is my sister. What do you think?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I wasn't exaggerating, was I? She's top-notch in both looks and figure."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jackson's eyes sparkled with desire as he licked his lips. "Oh, I'm definitely impressed. She's one of the best I've ever seen."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane beamed, seizing the moment. "Mr. Gellar, could the Brilliant Group get the exclusive rights to the magic powder?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Andrew, caught off guard, interjected, "Wait, Jane, why give the rights to the Brilliant Group? Why not our family?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane rolled her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dad, have you lost your marbles? Haven't you heard the saying about the dangers of possessing something valuable? Even if Mr. Gellar was willing to give us the rights, can you handle it?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Brilliant Group has already promised me the position of Vice President, but only if I secure those rights. Once I'm in that role, the Fairfax family will soar."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Andrew fell silent, his face darkening as he glared at his daughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hadn't expected to be outmaneuvered like this, and it left him seething with frustration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After schooling her father, Jane turned back to Jackson with a bright smile. "So, Mr. Gellar, can the Brilliant Group have the rights to the magic powder?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jackson feigned hesitation, taking his time before nodding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sure, but I have two conditions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"First, Felicity has to be my woman. Second, the Brilliant Group needs to cough up a billion dollars as an agency fee, splitting the profits from the magic powder fifty-fifty."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane's eyes lit up with excitement at Jackson's straightforwardness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Felicity was livid.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her parents and sister were clearly ready to use her as a bargaining chip in their twisted game of commerce.</span></p><div class="pagination">
