  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Miss, we're the plumbers. Is it your pipes that need fixing?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes! Please, come in!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lilian bowed her head as she ushered Keith and his team inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she bowed, her ample chest was on full display, making Keith's eyes widen in surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once in the kitchen, Keith feigned inspection, glancing around, then said, "I'll need to </span><span>check the bathroom as well. Why don't you step outside for a smoke and take a break?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Keith sent the other man away, entered the bathroom alone, and the cameraman followed closely behind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They prepared to film the bathroom scene, pausing briefly as usual to hear the director's notes and guidance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Keith mulled over how to deliver a convincing performance with the emotional nuances the scene required.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lilian approached, bowed to Keith, and said with a coy smile, "Mr. Robinson, you've worked hard. Please guide me during the next scene!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lilian was a well-known actress, consistently ranking among the top ten.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Keith quickly stood and nodded politely, exuding gentlemanly charm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The standards for leading male actors were so high that qualified candidates were becoming rare.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Someone like Keith was truly one in a million.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wasn't just charismatic&mdash;his stamina and physical attributes were outstanding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In just two days, Dragon Film and Television Company was already abuzz with his reputation; he was bound to be a star.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was no surprise that a top actress like Lilian would go out of her way to greet him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stunning and seductive, Lilian was a dream for many men. But Keith, while respectful, wasn't overly excited&mdash;unlike his reaction when he first met Amira.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He joked, "Ms. Hughes, do I need to clean up again later?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lilian covered her mouth, giggling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Robinson, you're so funny. Didn't you already clean up? Besides, I think you're very handsome."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Keith laughed smugly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was just a joke, but he hadn't expected Lilian to compliment him so directly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If I don't do well later, Mr. Robinson, I hope you'll forgive me and be understanding."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lilian apologized as she bowed deeply.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As expected, top actresses like her were always professional.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, she'd be filming a submissive scene with Keith, yet here she was asking for his forgiveness. Only in a movie set could this happen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The director approached, gave a few pointers to Keith and Lilian, and then resumed filming.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inside the bathroom, Keith smiled and asked Lilian, "Miss, could you help me find some waterproof tape? It's in my toolbox."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just a moment, I'll get it right away."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The camera followed Lilian as she bent down, arching her back while rummaging through the toolbox.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her curvy, round figure swayed occasionally, making her incredibly captivating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Keith stared intently from behind, his lecherous and fascinated expression captured perfectly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This kind of expression was difficult for beginners, but Keith performed flawlessly&mdash;especially with Lilian's enticing pose.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lilian searched for a while but couldn't find the tape, so she turned around to speak to Keith.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When she saw Keith's mesmerized look, she froze for a moment and then burst out laughing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lilian moved closer, pressing her body against Keith's, wrapped her arms around his </span><span>neck, and kissed him passionately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, her hand slid down, fondling him through his pants.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sir, your body is so strong&mdash;much bigger than my husband's...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh! Being young is so nice. Why are you so eager? Is it because you don't have a girlfriend yet?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you want to be naughty? Should I help you with that...?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Keith didn't have any lines in this scene&mdash;he just needed to convey a mix of nervousness and excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a while, Lilian's gaze grew hazy and intense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though Keith hadn't done anything to her yet, Lilian felt warmth between her thighs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Of all the actors she'd worked with, Keith was the most impressive&mdash;both in size and presence.</span></p><div class="pagination">
