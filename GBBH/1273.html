  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander had been trying to stay at his observation post for this stakeout, moving as little as possible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But with his phone useless&mdash;no power, no signal&mdash;and now no cigarettes, the boredom was getting to him. He felt restless, and uncomfortable in his own skin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sound of pounding echoed through the hallway. It was the hotel housekeeper&mdash;now turned zombie&mdash;persistently trying to get in again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander had noticed that these zombies still retained some of their old habits. This housekeeper, for instance, kept banging on doors as if still making rounds to clean the rooms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though Alexander hadn't been here long, he was already getting used to these regular disturbances.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After meditating for a while, his stomach started growling again</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ever since becoming an Advanced Warrior, Alexander had noticed his appetite growing alongside his increasing powers. Even that bowl of emergency rations he'd just eaten was already digested after just a brief meditation session.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He'd broken down some furniture for firewood to cook with.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The box contained some baguettes, and once heated, the bread filled the air with an irresistible aroma.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Standing by the window, Alexander took large bites of the bread while keeping watch&mdash;his eyes moving between the Sakra Tower across the street and the zombies wandering below.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The heavy, dark sky cast a gloomy atmosphere, its cold eeriness adding to the unsettling mood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After finishing his meal, Alexander washed his hands and picked up the machete lying nearby.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He preferred not to use his Lightsabers unless absolutely necessary. They drained too much of the Force, and using them might reveal his identity to the higher-ups at the Sakra Society.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as he opened the door, a blackened zombie hand shot toward him. The creature, still wearing its hotel cleaning staff uniform, lunged like a hawk swooping for its prey, its sharp black claws aimed straight at Alexander's flesh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without hesitation, Alexander swung his machete, cleanly severing the rotting hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In one fluid motion, he followed through with a backhand strike, decapitating the zombie. Its head tumbled across the floor with a sickening roll.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the zombie fell, Alexander felt a disturbing surge of bloodlust course through his body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Like his desire for women, the thirst for violence was another dark emotion. If his hunger for killing grew too strong, Alexander risked losing his sanity and falling from grace to become a Corrupted Warrior.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander could only shake his head with a wry smile. Being a Warrior wasn't as simple as it seemed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, two more hotel staff members turned zombies came charging at him, their rotting hands reaching out with deadly intent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their eye sockets were empty black holes, like bottomless pits oozing dark fluid.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's blade flashed twice, and two zombie heads hit the floor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though their bodies still twitched and writhed on the ground, they posed no more threat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The head was a zombie's only weak point. No other injury could stop them. Just as the brain served as the nerve center in life, it remained their sole vulnerability in death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The hallway was now littered with five zombie corpses, all taken down by Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They lay scattered in awkward positions, their black blood splattered everywhere, filling the air with a strange, nauseating stench.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander made his way to the hotel staff quarters. When he found the room he was looking for, he kicked the door clean off its hinges.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A sudden movement caught Alexander's eye as a dark shape darted out from inside. It was a skeletal black cat moving at incredible speed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It had been forty-eight hours since this catastrophe began. For some unknown reason, the surviving humans and animals weren't mutating spontaneously anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, if any normal person or animal got bitten by zombies or mutant beasts, they'd still get infected and turn into monsters.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the kitchen</span><span> of the </span><span>dorm, a thin layer of dust covered the dining table, broken only by scattered cat paw prints.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The power outage had spoiled all the meat and vegetables in the fridge, but Alexander got lucky. He found a dozen eggs still good and some sausages that were still edible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His luck held up as he discovered a few packs of women's cigarettes and grabbed a set of bedding with pillows. The room's previous occupant had clearly been a woman&mdash;a faint perfume scent lingered in the air, and the place was surprisingly tidy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander stuffed his findings into a large bag and slung it over his shoulder. Just as he stepped out the door, he spotted a zombie with a missing leg crawling toward him, leaving a disgusting trail of black fluid in its wake.</span></p><div class="pagination">
