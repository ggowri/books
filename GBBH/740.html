  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander came to Archer's bedside and scanned his body with All-seeing Eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eddy said to herself in surprise, "Archer's condition is the most serious. Can he cure Archer?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melin quickly said, "Ms. Hale, you have to have confidence in Alexander, and I believe in him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blaze, who had been following behind Melin, suddenly became unhappy and sneered, "Even if he invented the magic powder, it's completely different from curing the plague. I think he just wants to show off. A liar..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shut up!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Blaze could finish his sarcastic remarks, he screamed and covered his burning cheeks with his hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It turned out that Melin slapped him in the face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If I hear you slandering Alexander again, I will shoot you!" she warned Blaze murderously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blaze was stunned. Half of his cheek was in severe pain, but he didn't dare to say anything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, Melin was the sheriff and had a gun.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she turned around, Blaze retreated into the crowd, grumbling to himself with gritted teeth, "Bitch! You dare to hit me! Just wait and see, and I will make you kneel down and beg me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander completely ignored these trifle things and focused on checking Archer's condition.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Elaine and other experts saw him standing there blankly, they all showed disdainful expressions. He was indeed a young man who did not know his place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey, what are you dawdling about? If you don't have the ability, don't talk nonsense," Elaine scoffed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander ignored her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anderson, Gideon, Eddy, and the doctors and nurses at the Loscity Hospital remained silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone looked at Alexander with anticipation, each expression more complicated than the other.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They sincerely hope that he could find a way to eliminate the plague and bring relief to everyone in Loscity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Please...save me..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Archer also begged Alexander, with a last glimmer of hope emerging.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This big shot in the medical field no longer had his usual nobility and elegance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was emaciated, his face was pale, blood was oozing from his nostrils and mouth, and he coughed up blood from time to time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The dirty blood even contained fragments of internal organs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander confirmed that there was indeed poison in Archer's body!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fortunately, this poison had been stored in an ancient tomb for thousands of years, and its toxicity had been greatly weakened. Otherwise, all the people in Loscity would have died long ago.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But if it was not stopped, this poison would eventually spread all over the world and plunge all of humanity into disaster.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander knew that the City of Sorcery attacked Loscity out of hatred for him, so he felt that he had an </span><span>unshakable</span><span> responsibility.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne, please save me... Please..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Archer's consciousness had begun to blur, but his instinct for survival still made him ask Alexander for help.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't take in enough oxygen and could only gasp for air, as if an old bellow had </span><span>reached the end of its limit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was such a horrible sight, and it felt like he was going to die in the next second.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eddy and several doctors wanted to perform rescue operations but were stopped by Elaine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No one is allowed to help. Didn't this guy say he could eradicate the plague and cure the patients? He must be allowed to do that. If he can't do it, then he is a liar and must be severely punished!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Blunt, am I right?" Elaine asked Anderson.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anderson nodded heavily with a gloomy face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was slow to act because he was waiting for an opportunity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The poison had destroyed Archer's body functions, and the toxins even penetrated into his bones and internal organs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if Archer were given an antidote now, it would not be possible to remove all the poison at once.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But there was one last chance, that is, when Archer really died, all the poison would converge on his heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander only had a few minutes to use the antidote to eliminate all the poison in Archer's body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Otherwise, as long as there was even a little bit of poison left in Archer's body, he would surely die.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry, and I will save him. It's not the last moment yet."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's tone was very calm, and he spoke as if it was a matter of course.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Liar! I wonder how long you can keep lying."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elaine laughed endlessly.</span></p><div class="pagination">
