  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What do you think?" Monica asked in a grim tone, staring at Brandon and Yinson. Her eyeballs looked like those of a dead fish.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brandon swallowed his saliva and said in a somewhat dry voice, "Ms. Quinn, I fully agree, but please give me some face. Take action after my men evacuate from </span><span>Loscity</span><span>."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yinson nodded repeatedly. "Yes. My men are in </span><span>Loscity</span><span>, too. Spread the plague after they evacuate."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were obviously very afraid of Monica, and their tone softened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Monica snorted contemptuously, "They are just your subordinates. Even if they die, it's not a big deal. But this is the first time you have begged me, so I will give you a </span><span>face."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it had been someone else, Brandon would definitely have let him know how terrifying the devil in hell was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But facing a crazy woman like Monica, he could only smile awkwardly and stiffly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He would not call Bruno back. He had to let Bruno hide in </span><span>Loscity</span><span>. In addition, with the outbreak of the plague, the chance of killing Alexander greatly increased. Brandon was very excited and expectant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yinson turned a deaf ear to what Monica had said, not daring to say a word.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On Treasure Island, Alexander, Shadow, Augusta, William, Rosalia, Charlize, Cloe, and the other senior executives of the Brilliant Group were holding a meeting to discuss the next plan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Despite the victory this time, we must be careful. Their counterattack could come at any time. We must not take it lightly."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander ordered with a serious expression, "Shadow, make some arrangements. I want to meet the leaders of other small and medium-sized forces on the island. Some of them have had contact with Felix before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Although they have surrendered now, I must intimidate them so that I can return to </span><span>Loscity</span><span> with peace of mind."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, Mr. Hawthorne. I'll arrange it right away."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shadow immediately notified his subordinates to prepare an open-air barbecue party in the evening and invited the leaders of all the powerful forces on the island.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Within a quarter of an hour, the leaders of dozens of small and medium-sized forces on Treasure Island received the invitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the past, they had all made their livings under the jurisdiction of the Red Umbrella Group and the Brilliant Group, and many of them had even entered into an alliance with Felix.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now that Felix was dead, they were worried that Alexander would kill them directly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After receiving the invitation, they were somewhat relieved. If he wanted to eliminate them, it would only take a word. There was no need to go through the trouble of holding a barbecue party.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Realizing that their lives were not in danger, they excitedly prepared all kinds of valuable gifts in order to curry favor with him. From now on, Treasure Island belonged to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In fact, a large part of these forces had more influence outside of Treasure Island.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But this was Treasure Island. Despite their influence outside, they had to be obedient.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the evening, bonfires were lit on a beautiful beach on Treasure Island.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Besides, twinkling lights around gave the beach a gorgeous look.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Patrol teams passed by from time to time on the beach and in the city.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From now on, anyone who dared to commit a murder or cheat on Treasure Island would be killed without mercy if discovered by the patrol teams!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But no one would ask what they had done before or outside the island.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even a wanted criminal worldwide wouldn't be arrested or discriminated against on the island.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The number of criminals was greater than that of stars in the sky, but they all behaved themselves, not daring to violate the regulations issued by Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The patrol law enforcement teams were all elite. Each team had seven people, and the team leader was a strong man wearing a combat exoskeleton.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The entire Treasure Island was as well organized as a very nice tourist island city.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In addition to promulgating the regulations, Alexander set up a magic circle with gems in the basement of the Red Umbrella Group's square.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The magic circle came from the Ultimate Legacy and was left behind by an ancient wizard who was killed by the Warriors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the amazing protective magic circle, the strong sea wind blowing towards Treasure Island became gentle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the future, even if a storm were to strike, it would be greatly weakened by the magic circle, which was simply a miracle for an island city.</span></p><div class="pagination">
