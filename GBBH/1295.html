  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander dragged Maxwell into a small grove and set him down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He checked his injuries. Seeing they weren't fatal, he grabbed a bottle of mineral water and poured it over Maxwell's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah! Ahh...who the hell hit me?! That hurts like hell!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxwell clutched his head and groaned as he woke up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander held half a brick in his hand, his voice cold. "I have two questions. First, where are we? Second, where are the zombies and mutant beasts?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was his first time interrogating someone like this. His heart was pounding, but he knew he had to act tougher than his target if he wanted answers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxwell tried to put on a fierce front and shouted, "You! You little punk, you hit me? Do you even know who my boss is?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander raised the brick threateningly. "I don't care who your boss is. If you don't talk, I'll smash your skull in."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He weighed the brick in his hand, making himself look even more intimidating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxwell's bravado crumbled. He paled, his body trembling uncontrollably.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you gonna talk or not?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander swung his arm as if he were about to strike.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is Kylaville! Zombies? Mutant beasts? Are you crazy?! I can tell you how Maris set everything up. Just let me go, please!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxwell broke down completely. He spilled everything about how Maris paid him for sedatives, how she hired him to harm Silvia. He left nothing out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sir, I... I told you everything. Can I go now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxwell slowly scooted backward on the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander tightened his grip on the brick, his expression shifting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "Kylaville?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The last thing he remembered was arriving in Kylaville and saving Sally. Then, he had entered... somewhere. After that, his memory was blank. The next thing he knew, he had woken up here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everything felt like a bizarre dream, yet he could sense a faint return of the Force in his body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was all too strange.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Deep in thought, he didn't bother stopping Maxwell when he scrambled to his feet and bolted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But before disappearing into the distance, Maxwell turned and yelled, "Just you wait! My boss is Trey Calderon. He's gonna kill you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without hesitation, Alexander hurled the brick at him. Maxwell let out a terrified yelp and ran even faster.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander emerged from the grove and was about to get on his bike when a familiar Audi sped toward him and came to a screeching halt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The door swung open and out stepped a stunning woman in a white coat. Alexander recognized her immediately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Garcia?" He greeted her. Laurie Garcia, the hospital director, looked at him in surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander? What are you doing here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A warm smile appeared on her gorgeous face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I had the day off... just finished delivering an order."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander scratched the back of his head, feeling a little embarrassed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laurie was breathtaking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even in her white coat, she exuded an irresistible allure. The coat was unbuttoned, revealing a black mini-dress underneath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The deep V neckline exposed a tantalizing glimpse of her cleavage. Her waist was slender, and beneath the hem of her dress, her long, fair legs gleamed like polished jade.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her eyes were soft and inviting, carrying a trace of seductive charm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander found himself comparing her to Ava.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laurie was like a blooming red rose, fragrant and intoxicating. Ava, on the other hand, was a cold, elegant orchid.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laurie studied him with a hint of suspicion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Something about him felt... different today.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The way he looked at her sent a shiver down her spine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had only ever seen that kind of gaze in powerful men who stood at the top.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She softened her tone. "Alexander, I know you want to make extra money, but you should skip deliveries today. Go home and study. Tomorrow's the residency exam. It will decide whether you stay at the hospital."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she spoke, she stepped closer and adjusted his collar for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her body leaned forward, and in an instant, her ample curves filled his entire vision.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her figure was flawless, and her breasts were huge!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laurie inched even closer, nearly pressing against him. She gazed into his eyes and whispered, "What are you looking at?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander felt his body react.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He had memories of this life. From the very first day of his internship at Healiva Hospital, Laurie had always been especially kind to him.</span></p><div class="pagination">
