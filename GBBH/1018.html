  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They found a cozy corner booth, ordered coffee, and began chatting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Keith casually asked, "Paula, does Mr. Payne know you're out here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Paula's face instantly darkened, and she shot Keith a glare before pouting, "Keith, why bring up that old man? You're killing the mood!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Keith chuckled, "I'm just worried. Do you know? What if Decker shows up and catches us when I come over to fix your pipes? That would be a disaster for me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Paula scoffed, rolling her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What are you afraid of? He's not even the leader anymore, just an old-timer with a lot of information about Sakra Society's members.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Don't worry. He's sick and in the hospital, so when you come to my place later, you'd better be good to me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Of course, Paula, I'll take good care of you. I'll make sure you're completely satisfied," Keith said, nodding enthusiastically as his hand slid onto Paula's thigh, caressing it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Well, you men are all the same. You are so lecherous!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Paula teased, her voice dripping with both mock indignation and pleasure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This mature, sensual woman made Keith want to devour her, to take her with all the force he had.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He couldn't wait. Once he had Paula under control, he might be able to get some valuable information from Decker about "Cyclops."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hazel was paired with "Cyclops," so finding him meant finding Hazel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Keith's hand gradually slid up Paula's short skirt as he stroked her thigh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Paula shuddered, gazing at him with hungry and desire-filled eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Decker was aged and unable to satisfy Paula. But Keith was a different one.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Keith was in no rush, though. He just wanted to stir Paula's desire so he could manipulate her more easily later.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Paula, already melting into Keith's embrace, pressed her soft and full breasts against him, making his body tighten.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She was wearing a low-cut T-shirt and light blue denim shorts that stopped just at her thighs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her snowy white breasts and long legs were on full display, exuding irresistible charm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Keith could already feel her wetness and knew it was time. He wrapped his arm around her waist, ready to take her to the car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Just as they were about to leave the caf&eacute;, rain suddenly began to pour.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The heavy rain quickly soaked them as they made their way across the few feet to the car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Let's drive... We'll hide from the rain at your place and have some fun," Keith said with a grin, giving her a playful squeeze on the backside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Paula's face flushed red. She leaned in and lightly touched Keith's thigh, laughing mischievously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Keith, be rough with me later... I like men who are a bit wild. That's what makes a man manly."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Hey, don't worry, Paula. If there's one thing I'm good at, it's being rough and manly," Keith chuckled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was clear that Paula was just like Chaalis.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Keith had plenty of experience with women like her and knew exactly how to make them submit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before long, the Mercedes-Benz pulled up in front of a luxury apartment building.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They walked towards the entrance and Paula led the way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was obvious Paula had gotten a lot of money from Decker. This area was upscale, with 24-hour security and top-tier renovations. It was anything but cheap.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As they entered the lobby, Keith noticed a security guard standing by the elevator, glaring at him with a mix of jealousy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The guard had always fantasized about Paula, the fiery and sexy woman with long legs and a full figure. Yet, Paula was now in Keith's arms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As Paula walked, her hips swayed enticingly, making the guard burn with desire. He could barely keep himself from pushing Keith aside to take her for himself.</span></p><div class="pagination">
