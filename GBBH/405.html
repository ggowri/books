  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next day, after breakfast, Alexander drove the three of them to the largest water park in </span><span>Loscity</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The water park had a full range of attractions&mdash;a scenic Ferris wheel, thrilling roller coasters, space shuttles, rapids, bungee jumping, and plenty more fun activities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander bought the tickets, and Ashley walked happily between them, beaming with excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as they entered, Ashley started clamoring for ice cream.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava quickly bought three cartoon-themed ice creams, one for each, which made Ashley ecstatic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Daddy, can I have a bite of your Mickey Mouse one?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ashley leaned over, took a bite of Alexander's ice cream, and then smacked her lips happily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Daddy's ice cream is so tasty!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ava, can I have a bite of your Donald Duck too?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After taking a bite of Ava's, Ashley held up her own ice cream to Ava and said, "Here, you eat mine too!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What a sweetie you are."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Smiling, Ava took a bite, leaving a red lipstick mark on the ice cream.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ashley immediately turned and offered her ice cream to Alexander. "Daddy, you eat too!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without a second thought, Alexander licked right over the spot Ava had bitten, erasing the lipstick mark.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He shot Ava an amused smile, and she realized he did it on purpose. Remembering the previous night's intensity, she blushed deeply.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander chuckled, his expression revealing he'd meant it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava rolled her eyes at him, then turned to Ashley and asked, "Ashley, what do you want to go on first?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ashley pointed ahead excitedly. "Let's go to the water!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander looked at the giant pool ahead, with a towering slide dozens of feet high.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One by one, bikini-clad women slid down, hitting the water with a splash and sending droplets flying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was the perfect summer activity. It's refreshing and cool.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava took Ashley to the changing room, and they came out in swimwear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ashley wore a cute children's swimsuit, while Ava had on a three-piece bikini, showing off her curves in all the right places. She's both full and slender.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Remembering the previous night, Alexander felt a surge of desire and a sense of conquest for this beautiful woman who'd been entirely his.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Daddy, why are you staring at Ava like that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ashley shouted out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava's cheeks flushed pink as she scolded playfully, "Silly, let's go."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She picked up Ashley, turning her back to Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander quickly followed after them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava stole a glance at Alexander's tall, toned physique and couldn't help but murmur, "I hadn't noticed before, but you're actually in pretty good shape."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Taking advantage of Ashley's distraction, Alexander gave Ava a playful slap on her backside, making her gasp.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ava, what happened?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ashley asked, curious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Ava lost for words, Alexander covered his mouth, trying not to laugh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's you guys!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, Alexander heard a familiar, surprised voice behind him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's expression shifted. He turned, and sure enough, it was her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane approached with a few young men and women.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane was dressed in a revealing swimsuit, her makeup flawless, and she was glaring unhappily at Alexander and Ava.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom, do you want to play with us?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ashley asked hopefully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Jane looked at a scar-faced man beside her, her expression conflicted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom, why aren't you saying anything? Mom... what's wrong?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ashley was visibly disappointed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane stammered, "Ashley, you go ahead and play. I have something else to take care of. Next time, I'll take you to have fun..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ashley let out a quiet "Oh," and fell silent, but she pouted, clearly unhappy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The other young men and women with Jane, whom Alexander didn't know, were all glancing at him and whispering, obviously talking about him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander hadn't expected to run into Jane here, and his previously good mood vanished instantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wasn't afraid of Jane, but deep down, he felt a strong aversion to her and had no desire to see her, let alone speak to her.</span></p><div class="pagination">
