  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But within a second, Louise returned to her usual condescending attitude.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She acted like she was a princess high above everyone else, expecting others to look up to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alice was quietly observing Louise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing Craig comforting Alexander and catching bits of everyone's conversations, she quickly pieced together the history between Alexander and Louise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What a foolish woman, letting go of such a great man," Alice thought to herself with amusement. She gently placed a hand on Alexander's leg, offering him silent comfort.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander responded with a smile, his mood instantly lifting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Back then, Louise had dumped him for being poor and lacking prospects.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She had never even acknowledged him as her boyfriend, treating him as nothing more than a backup plan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Now, everything was different. Who cared about her being the campus queen?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Any woman by Alexander's side now easily outshone her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Louise's arrival had suddenly made the atmosphere more lively.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Alexander, I heard you divorced Jane. Why did you two split up?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Louise asked, her face full of curiosity. It was clear she wasn't genuinely concerned. She just wanted the juicy details.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before Alexander could respond, Bobby interjected eagerly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Louise, even we didn't know this guy got divorced! It's obvious, though, that his wife must've been fed up with him. A useless bum with no job? Who wouldn't leave him?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Bobby, trying to act like a big shot in front of Louise, was starting to get carried away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even with Alexander's typically good temper and his desire to maintain cordial relations with former classmates, this was going too far.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Louise, my personal life has nothing to do with you. Stay out of it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"And Bobby, was the slap earlier not enough? Do I need to teach you another lesson?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Denise, who had always acted like Bobby's loyal guard, immediately jumped up in anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Alexander, how dare you talk to Mr. Murray like that? And that slut hit him earlier. We haven't even settled that score yet! You're so ungrateful!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Emboldened by Denise's support, Bobby started shouting again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Alexander, you piece of trash! I paid for this reunion, and this is how you repay me?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You even brought some prostitute to pretend she's the secretary to the CEO of the Saint Group. What a joke!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Bring that slut over here. I'm going to teach her a lesson!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Louise feigned shock, pointing at Alice mockingly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"She's the secretary to the Saint Group's CEO? Her? Don't make me laugh. It's absurd!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Bobby grew even bolder, reaching out to grab Alice's hair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You're asking for it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander stood up and swung his arm, landing a heavy slap across Bobby's face. The blow knocked Bobby to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With a cry, Bobby spat out a mouthful of blood, along with two teeth. He writhed in pain, wailing loudly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The entire room froze in shock. No one had expected Alexander to strike so fiercely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Louise pointed at Alexander, furious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You've gone too far! Bobby invited you here out of kindness, and you hit him? And so viciously! I knew I had made the right choice by dumping you back then. Thank goodness I did!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Jane divorced you because you were abusive, didn't she?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Louise's baseless accusations almost made Alexander explode with rage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He fixed his icy gaze on Louise, making her break into a cold sweat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her back felt like it was freezing, and she started trembling uncontrollably.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You dare hit me that hard? I'll make you pay for this!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Bobby finally managed to catch his breath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clutching his swollen face, which now looked like a pig's head, he groaned and pulled out his phone to make a call.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Hey, Shawn, I just got beaten up. Bring some guys over. I'll send you the address!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After hanging up, Bobby smirked, certain Alexander was doomed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Glaring at Alexander, he sneered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If you kneel down and apologize right now, I'll go easy on you for old times' sake and only break one of your arms."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander was speechless. Faced with such stupidity, he didn't even know how to respond.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alice, however, couldn't hold back her laughter and thought, "This kind of trash thinks he can break Mr. Hawthorne's leg? What a joke."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But the other classmates didn't find it funny.</span></p><div class="pagination">
