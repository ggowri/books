  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After a while, Alexander withdrew his hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Good. Although it only contains a small amount of metal, I need meteorites like this, at least two hundred and fifty kilograms."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander used the Force to refine the meteorite into meteoric iron, and it would consume more than 90% of the meteorite, so he guessed he would need around two hundred and fifty kilos of them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Two hundred and fifty kilograms?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Anne couldn't help but exclaim.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mr. Hawthorne, although meteorites have a collection value, they are costly. This meteorite has cost tens of millions of dollars. Two hundred and fifty kilograms might cost over one billion dollars."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander asked, "What, don't I have the authority to spend more than a billion?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No, no, the entire Saint Group belongs to you, and you can spend it however you want."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Anne waved her hands with fright, her plump boobs going up and down seductively.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Ms. Hollister, please find a reliable gem merchant for me. I need a top-quality yellow gemstone this size. It has to be pure."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander gestured to Anne.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The Force of a Warrior was most closely connected to the power of the stars. The yellow gemstone represented the earth, and it was the best choice for Alexander to make a lightsaber.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Anne was taken aback, unable to figure out what Alexander was up to.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mr. Hawthorne, there are two types of top-quality yellow gemstone, yellow diamond and yellow jade. A pure yellow gemstone the size of a golf ball is not only invaluable but also difficult to find."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander smiled and said, "I won't ask you for help if it's easy to get."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mr. Hawthorne, jewelry is one of the important industries of the Kaylon. As long as you are willing to spend money, you will definitely find it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Anne felt it was much easier to find a top-quality gemstone than meteorites even though they were rare.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At the mention of the Kaylon, Alexander smiled broadly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"The Kaylon? Isn't Sir Stewart a senior executive of the Kaylon?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes, Sir Stewart is in charge of the Loscity branch of the Kaylon and has the say in all affairs in Loscity."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Anne answered respectfully.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander was full of confidence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He said, "Very good. Please tell Sir Stewart what I need, and I believe he will come to see me soon."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Anne was taken aback.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She failed to understand why Alexander was so confident.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After Anne left, Alexander continued to meditate and study the Ultimate Legacy left behind by James.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The Ultimate Legacy was a veritable treasure trove, which contained many special abilities that were simply incredible.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Unfortunately, Alexander was only a Novice Warrior, and his Force was not strong enough to learn.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">To make a lightsaber, he had to set up an energy magic formation with his Force apart from the meteorite iron and top-grade gemstone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander studied the magic formations in the Ultimate Legacy and didn't feel the elapse of time at all.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Soon half a day passed. Suddenly the alarm clock went off.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander jumped up immediately. It was time to go to the hospital. Ashley was going to have surgery today.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She suffered a gunshot and got seriously injured.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At his current level, he couldn't heal his daughter with the Force.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander took a deep breath.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He muttered, "Ashley, I'll get stronger and become the Godfather. I'll protect you from any hurt for the rest of your life."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Because he had been down and out, he needed to be invincible.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He would protect his daughter, Lily, and Ava.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Thinking of these important people in his life, Alexander was full of expectations for the future.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander hurried to the hospital.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The best cardiac surgeon in Loscity had come as well as the doctor who ridiculed Alexander for not affording the medical treatment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The doctor was the surgeon's student. Seeing his teacher being so respectful to Alexander and flattered him, he was shocked and afraid that Alexander would cause trouble for him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">To his relief, Alexander ignored him. The doctor was like an ant in Alexander's eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After his daughter was escorted into the operating room, Alexander sat outside and waited quietly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He narrowed his eyes slightly and meditated to ease his anxiety.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">An invisible small cyclone formed around him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Fortunately, this place was sealed down by people sent by Anne, and Alexander was alone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Meanwhile, Oscar hung up on Anne in the Loscity Branch of the Kaylon.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He felt indignant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Damn Alexander, does he think he's so great just because he's supported by the Saint Group? He actually sent Anne to ask me for the top-grade yellow gemstone. I won't sell any to him even if I have it."</p><div class="pagination">
