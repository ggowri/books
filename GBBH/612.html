  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There's an underground secret exchange at the Rose Market? And there's an auction of top-grade gems?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was truly amazed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had been to Rose Market a few times before, but never could he have imagined that beneath this bustling flea market lay a clandestine exchange, let alone one frequented by top-grade gems.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This secret underground marketplace was the pride of Olivia's father, but now it had attracted the unwanted attention of the Mafia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Olivia's entire family had been wiped out, leaving her alone with a piece of blue </span><span>sapphire, desperately fleeing from the Mafia's relentless pursuit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her life was spared only by the timely intervention of Alexander, or she would have met a tragic end.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Please, just help me get revenge, and I'll give you the gem. I'll give you everything I have," Olivia said, suddenly throwing herself into Alexander's arms, wrapping her arms around his neck, and passionately kissing him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was taken aback; he hadn't expected Olivia to be so proactive in her quest for vengeance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before he could even protest, Olivia's tongue had already pried open his tightly sealed lips, deftly finding his own tongue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her hands moved down his chest, slipping into his waistband.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander could clearly sense that Olivia's moves were clumsy yet driven, leaving him somewhat speechless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The fire of desire had been ignited within him. On the flight back from Kingsdon to Loscity, Alexander had already been thinking about getting home and indulging in a passionate rendezvous with Ava.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Little did he foresee that saving Olivia for her gem would lead to this unexpected situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Had it been any other woman, Alexander would have already pushed her away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the fact that Olivia was still a virgin, a fact that promised to significantly enhance his Force, gave him pause.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Help me, please! I'll give you everything!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Olivia, having been rescued, placed all her hopes on Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Mafia was an insurmountable entity to her, a foe she could never hope to defeat. But Alexander had effortlessly dealt with Malvern and his gang earlier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, Malvern had shown a clear fear of Alexander, which convinced Olivia that he was no ordinary man. It was this realization that pushed her to stake everything on this desperate gamble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Olivia's sweet, tender tongue in his mouth, the delicate scent of a woman's body pervading his nostrils, and her voluptuous frame in his embrace, Alexander found himself losing control of his own desires.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Olivia felt the change in his body, the unmistakable hardness pressing against her abdomen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though she had never been with a man before, she knew exactly what it was, and a surge of unfamiliar excitement flooded her senses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But before Olivia could react any further, Alexander gently pushed her away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You might regret this one day, but if you give me the blue sapphire, I'll help you get your revenge," he said, his voice firm yet kind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Olivia was taken aback, tears streaming down her face as she thought he was rejecting her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander had already offended the Mafia, and the reason there hadn't been a deeper conflict was because of his father, who was standing firm against them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Regardless of Olivia's plea, Alexander was determined to take down the Godfather, known as the Reaper, and incorporate the Mafia into the Ultimate Alliance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without a word, Olivia slipped the sapphire into Alexander's hand, then, with a deep breath, she made up her mind and pulled down the zipper of his pants with trembling hands, revealing the throbbing dick.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What are you doing?" Alexander asked, caught off guard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I know you're a good man. I'll give you the gem, and I'll keep my promise. Everything I have is yours. You'll be my first man," Olivia said, her voice steady.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, she opened her mouth and began to suck, her movements clumsy but earnest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was speechless, the rush of excitement coursing through him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though Olivia lacked skill, her dedication moved him&mdash;not every woman would give up everything for revenge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she continued, Olivia felt the dick growing within her mouth, an act she had never imagined herself doing, yet Olivia found no disgust, only joy in pleasing the man before her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander gently cradled the back of her head with his right hand, his left caressing her cheek.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Olivia looked up at him with wide, seductive eyes. Seeing the loving smile on his face, she felt a surge of encouragement and began to move more actively.</span></p><div class="pagination">
