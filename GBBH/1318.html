  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander and Logan saw two figures standing ahead. A lad dressed in white and a servant girl in green behind him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The lad was around 15 or 16. His hair was slicked back with gel. His features were youthful, sharp, yet gentle. He had bright eyes, a small nose, and lips set in a firm line as he glared at the man before him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man wore a black suit. His skin appeared unhealthy, with small, beady eyes and sunken cheeks. His yellowed teeth were visible as he sneered, and his face was dotted with pockmarks. Behind him stood an elderly man in a well-worn robe, accompanied by several young attendants dressed in modest tunics.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The lackeys began jeering. "Boy, Mr. Wetherall fancies your maid. Consider it an honor!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just hand her to us already!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The dandy young man, Julius Wetherall, leered and stepped closer to the lad in white. "Lad, name your price. I'll buy her off your hands!" With that, he reached out to grab the servant girl.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How dare you!" the white-clad youth snapped, pulling the girl behind him as he stepped back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop!" Logan suddenly shouted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was startled and yanked Logan back. "Are you out of your mind?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, I was shouting for you! This is how they do it in dramas! You're the main character, after all," Logan said, grinning like a fool.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander rolled his eyes. "You don't even know who they are, and you're already making a scene."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julius froze. Seeing that it was just two raggedly dressed lads chattering away, his temper flared. "Where did these savages come from?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julius lunged forward, striking with a move called Shadowstrike, aiming straight for Alexander's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A sharp glint flashed in Alexander's eyes. He sidestepped, yanking Julius to the right while hooking his foot behind him, preparing to send him sprawling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Huh?" Julius exclaimed in surprise. With a subtle shift, he steadied himself using the Iron Sentinels technique. His feet were rooted like an iron anchor. His right elbow shot forward like a spear, aiming straight at Alexander's chest, the force behind it carried the sharp whistle of breaking stone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander thrust both hands forward in a move known as Arhat Lifts, barely blocking Julius' vicious elbow strike.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Julius was relentless. His right arm snapped downward like a whip, his fingers curling into a claw as he struck straight for Alexander's groin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn, he's going for the dirty tricks!" Alexander was furious. He twisted his body, channeling the Force from his core. His spine flexed, and his fist shot forward, crackling with a thunderous roar as it hurtled toward Julius' head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julius barely had time to react. In mere moments, his skull was about to be split open like a smashed melon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, a black shadow streaked across like a lightning bolt, appearing beside Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Alexander could register what had happened, a deafening boom rang in his ears. His arm was abruptly deflected, and a numbing sensation rippled through half his body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander had already reached the peak of a level-one warrior. His senses were razor-sharp, yet this sudden intrusion caught him entirely off guard. A chilling sensation shot up his spine, spreading to the back of his skull. Goosebumps erupted across his skin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that critical moment, a burning heat flared in his chest. A powerful surge of warmth flooded his body, instantly dispelling the numbness. With the Force surging at full power, he snapped his hands back to guard his chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A deafening impact followed as Alexander's arms collided head-on with the intruder's strike.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander groaned as he was sent flying backward, crashing straight into Logan. The two tumbled across the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The white-clad youth clenched his fists tightly, his gaze fixed on the elderly man in a black suit beside Julius. He muttered, "Lightning-fast strikes and thunderous fists... He is a level-three warrior expert!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Make way! Move aside! What's going on here?" A squad of Hrodvik soldiers marched over from a distance, their polished armor gleaming under the sun. They wore swords on their belts and carried long spears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the front, a stern-looking officer strode forward, shoving aside the gathered onlookers as he barked, "Who dares cause trouble in Darwin? Arrest them all and take them to the Darwin Court!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julius stood frozen, his face still pale with shock, barely recovering from his brush with death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The elderly man beside him stepped forward calmly, retrieving a silver plaque from his suit pocket and presenting it to the officer. "Sir, this young man here is Mr. Wetherall. He is from the Marshal's Mansion."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The officer took a look at the plaque. On the front was an engraving of a grand estate, and on the back were two words: The Marshal. His demeanor shifted instantly. Straightening up, he bowed to the old man. "May I ask what happened here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The elder pointed at Alexander and Logan. "These two attacked Mr. Wetherall in broad daylight. Had I not intervened, he would've been gravely injured. Take them to Mr. Dewey at once for punishment."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Meanwhile, the white-clad youth and the servant girl hurried to help Alexander up from the ground.</span></p><div class="pagination">
