  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This sleazy idiot wasn't worth her time at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though her relationship with Nancy wasn't great, she genuinely felt for her half-sister.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"By the way, Clay, why didn't you come back with Nancy?" Richard asked, concerned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clay's smile vanished instantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Nancy's been a bit busy... She asked me to come ahead and keep you company. She should be here soon..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Heh, but I saw her driving back with a guy. I wonder what their relationship is," Sophie chimed in, a playful smile on her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What!?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clay's expression dropped in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His heart raced. Nancy wouldn't actually bring Alexander back, would she?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That would be a total slap in the face!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Richard frowned. "Nancy came back with a guy? Sophie, are you sure?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm positive. I even followed their car. I caught a quick glimpse&mdash;they looked pretty cozy. The guy's definitely better looking and more charming than Clay," Sophie said, pointing at Clay without holding back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm so mad..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clay's face turned red, utterly humiliated in front of everyone. He felt like he could explode.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although he'd been pushed around by Alexander a few days ago, he had trained hard since then and was confident he could take him on now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anyone who dared to steal his woman had to pay!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luther thought for a moment before chuckling,</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Clay, don't worry. I know Nancy. She's always been proud and never pays attention to guys. Even a young stud like you struggles to get her attention, let alone anyone else.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I think maybe Nancy did this on purpose to test you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, right. It's definitely a test," Clay agreed, though his expression grew </span><span>more grim</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The other day when he called Nancy, she was with Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just thinking about Nancy's beautiful body being with him made Clay's heart ache.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Where are my daughter and her man?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A striking middle-aged woman, supported by a couple of aides, hurried over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was Nancy's mother, Gill. Since Luther had a love child, she had been a bit off her rocker.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gill often had episodes where she wouldn't recognize anyone except for Nancy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Slow down, darling. Be careful not to trip," Luther said, quickly rising to help her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, they were married, and her mental health issues were partly his fault, so he felt guilty and always tried to accommodate her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom, I'm Nancy's man, Clay," he said, moving closer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You? Really my daughter's man?" Gill scrutinized Clay from head to toe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, yes! I'm your daughter's man, Clay..." Just then, Gill slapped him hard across the face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The slap left not only Clay but everyone else frozen in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You liar! You're just a country bumpkin with no looks and no charm. How could you be my daughter's man?" Gill shouted angrily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clay was speechless, unable to retaliate. He could only take a deep breath to suppress his rage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He forced a smile. "Mom, I really am Nancy's fianc&eacute;. We're getting engaged today."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Pfft!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gill spat on his face in disgust. "I don't agree with this marriage."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Haha!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sophie burst out laughing, unable to hold it in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clay's face turned green, but he didn't dare to fight back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Huff!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clay took another deep breath, reminding himself this was a test from above.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He absolutely couldn't lose his cool&mdash;he had to keep a gentleman's smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I really am your daughter's future husband..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shut up!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Another hard slap landed on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hehe..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sophie couldn't help but giggle, covering her mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clara quickly pulled her daughter aside, trying to hush her, but she struggled to hold back her own laughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luther's face turned red with embarrassment as he said,</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Clay, I'm really sorry. Please don't take it personally. You know how my wife's illness is&mdash;it's hard to treat."</span></p><div class="pagination">
