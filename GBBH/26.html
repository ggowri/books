  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander's mind drifted to the gentle visage of Frank, and with a wistful sigh, he picked up the phone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Frank's voice quivered as he spoke, "Alexander, I've just learned that Jane coerced you into the divorce. I am truly sorry. This is a failing of our family."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander offered a smile, uttering, "Sir Fairfax, that's all in the past. I'd rather not revisit it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Alexander, for Ashley's sake, could you perhaps remarry Jane?" Frank asked with a note of hope in his tone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander's response was immediate and resolute.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"There's no turning back for Jane and me, but I will care for Ashley well and ensure she lacks for nothing."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Frank fell silent for a moment before letting out a deep sigh.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Alexander, my health is deteriorating. I fear my time is short. Could you come to see me one last time?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander pondered the request, aware that Frank's cerebral infarction and ongoing brain capillary bleeding and blockage left him with little time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If the Force could be used to clear his blood vessels, perhaps Frank could live a few more years.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Alright, I'll come to bid you farewell later."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After Alexander agreed, Frank audibly relaxed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Half an hour later, Alexander arrived at the Fairfax Villa, a place that evoked both familiarity and disdain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As he surveyed the villa, memories of the past five years flooded his mind, including the humiliations endured and the fleeting joys.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">So much had transpired in just two days, but it felt like a lifetime had passed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Forgetting all this and healing the trauma swiftly was impossible; only time could dull the pain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Yet, thoughts of his adorable daughter and Ava's radiant smile filled Alexander with anticipation for the future.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With a somber expression, Alexander strode into the Fairfax Villa.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He intended to leave immediately after treating Frank, not lingering for even a moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The Fairfax family was in high spirits, drinking and laughing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Praises for Andrew and fawning over Jane filled the air.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Frank sat on the sofa with a grim expression.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Alexander, you're here! Come in and sit down!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Frank stood up with unbridled joy as he caught sight of Alexander. His voice boomed with warmth as he greeted Alexander.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Sir Fairfax, there's really no need for me to sit down," Alexander calmly replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The living room fell silent, and the atmosphere suddenly became tense.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Alexander, what are you doing here? Weren't you in the hospital after that nasty hit from Billy?" Jane asked as she gaped at Alexander in surprise.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Frank interjected quickly, "Jane, I called Alexander to see me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jane scoffed coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Grandpa, he's the reason Ryan was hospitalized. I've divorced him. Why do you still want him here?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Andrew chimed in angrily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Seize him! He's the one who harmed Ryan. He's not leaving until he reveals how to lift the curse!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A group of people encircled Alexander menacingly to gain favor with Ryan.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Frank swiftly intervened, holding them back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Andrew's anger boiled over, and he began to berate, "Dad, have you lost your mind? He's our enemy!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander's gaze was icy as he surveyed the scene.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Sir Fairfax, I'll help unblock your blood vessels and then I'll take my leave," he stated calmly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Help my grandpa heal? You're just trying to curse him again, aren't you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jane quickly pulled Frank away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Frank was frantic, tears welling in his eyes. He grasped Jane's hand and pleaded, "Jane, Alexander is a good man. For Ashley's sake, could you remarry Alexander?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Remarriage? Impossible. Alexander, I truly despise you. You actually had my grandfather act as your matchmaker. How despicable!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jane laughed mockingly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She waved the gold-embossed invitation card triumphantly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"See this? It's the invitation sent by the Saint Group to my fianc&eacute;, who's just been appointed as their vice president.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Alexander, I advise you to lift the curse immediately and beg for our forgiveness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"For Ashley's sake, I'll give you one chance, or you'll die without a proper burial!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jane threatened menacingly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander couldn't help but feel a surge of amusement.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Are you certain Ryan will become the vice president? Perhaps the chairman of the Saint Group is merely toying with you."</p><div class="pagination">
