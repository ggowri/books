  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Grace's curiosity was piqued.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She hadn't anticipated Asher's extravagant gesture of preparing tens of millions dollars in jewelry along with a mysterious final gift. It was genuinely heartfelt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yet, when she glanced at the small gift box from Alexander, a sweet smile spread across her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She valued his gift, regardless of its cost, and felt joy at whatever he gave her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Asher confidently commanded, "Bring it up!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Yes, Mr. Vance," his men responded in unison.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Several burly men escorted an elderly man who held a silver gift box with both hands. All eyes were on the box, clearly expecting something remarkable inside, as indicated by the heavy security.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The anticipation for Asher's grand final gift hushed the hall, making even the sound of a pin dropping audible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone was eager to see the gem within the box.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander, however, sneered inwardly, having already discerned what lay inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Taking the gift box, Asher strutted to the center of the hall, casting a smug glance at Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ave urged, "Asher, open it quickly. We want to see the treasure."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Yes, Mr. Vance. Please open it quickly. We want to see it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"We can't wait any longer, hurry up!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone started to urge him on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The more they urged, the more pleased Asher became. After whetting everyone's appetite, he finally slowly opened the gift box.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Suddenly, a beam of light shot up into the sky, and everyone's eyes were attracted by the dazzling ring.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The ring featured a large diamond surrounded by countless smaller stones, radiating a captivating light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Moreover, it exuded a noble aura and carried a hint of the mysterious and heavy sense of history.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone who saw this ring was involuntarily attracted, and a greedy expression appeared on their face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This diamond ring was so precious and amazing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even Grace was intrigued, asking, "What kind of ring is this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This is the Eros Ring," Asher declared. "Wearing it brings the blessing of the God of Love for a happy romance! It's a divine artifact."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He flaunted the ring while eyeing Alexander provocatively.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing Alexander remain composed, he felt a twinge of annoyance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander recognized the ring was no divine artifact. It was the Cursed Ring of an ancient wizard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Its long history was shrouded in secrets even modern wizards might not uncover.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander, possessing the Ultimate Legacy with notes from a powerful ancient wizard, saw through it immediately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ancient wizards crafted cursed jewelry to extend their lives.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Anyone wearing this ring would not find love. Instead, it would drain their life force, allowing the wizard to prolong his existence while ensuring the wearer wouldn't die.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Anyone who wore the ring would definitely die miserably.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Gentlemen, I spent a billion dollars on this Eros Ring to propose to my fianc&eacute;e," Asher announced. "Only such a precious artifact is worthy of her. Grace, will you marry me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Asher proposed to Grace in public. He knelt on one knee in front of Grace with the ring in his hand and looked at her expectantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>There was a sudden cheer at the scene.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Vance is so romantic! The Eros Ring is worth a billion dollars. How sincere!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What a perfect couple! Wishing them happiness!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The Vance family is on the rise. Their future is limitless!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone was captivated, oblivious to Alexander, as Asher's ring stole the show.</span></p><div class="pagination">
