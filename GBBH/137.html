  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jimbo let out a twisted grin. "Heh, Drake is my master, but I'm still a renowned gray wizard. Better spill it, kid, or I might get rough."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander scoffed. "</span><span>G</span><span>ray wizard? Bring it on if you've got the guts!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jimbo's face twisted in anger, and his wand shook violently in his grip.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You bastard! Go to hell!" With a fierce swing of his wand, Jimbo attacked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A swarm of gray beetles burst out of his wand, clouding the air as they swarmed towards Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each beetle was about the size of a soybean, covered in ugly, blotchy markings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, you're done for! One bite, and you'll be poisoned instantly. I'll make sure you beg for death. Let's see if you still have that big mouth..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But before he could finish, Jimbo froze in shock, staring wide-eyed at Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What... what's happening?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The swarm of venomous beetles buzzed around Alexander but couldn't get closer than a meter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander surrounded himself with the Force, creating a tough, invisible barrier around him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Poisonous bugs like these couldn't possibly break through a Force shield.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander calmly started swatting the beetles away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since his hands were wrapped in the Force, he had no fear of the poison.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The beetles cracked and burst with every slap. Alexander swatted them down like they were nothing more than mosquitoes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, these venomous beetles aren't all that impressive, are they?" Alexander said, feigning surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jimbo was speechless, nearly choking with frustration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had gone to great lengths to breed these venomous beetles, each as deadly as a cobra with a single touch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, Alexander was swatting them dead without so much as a scratch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander continued his taunting. "Hey! Is this all a gray wizard can do? Maybe you should scuttle back to the City of Sorcery before you embarrass yourself."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn you!" Jimbo was seething with fury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gritting his teeth, he snapped his wand and pulled out a small gray figurine the size of his thumb.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Biting his finger, he smeared blood over the figurine while muttering under his breath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The figurine seemed to grin creepily at Alexander, exuding a strange aura.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, Alexander felt a wave of dizziness, and his body weakened. The figurine's eerie smile grew even more twisted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, this is sorcery?" Surprised, he quickly channeled the Force, immediately feeling reinvigorated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sorcery might tap into supernatural powers, but the Force is drawn from the essence of nature itself, pure and powerful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Compared side-by-side, the Force is undoubtedly stronger and more refined.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How...how are you still standing? Are you some kind of monster?" Jimbo's eyes widened in terror.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His sorcery figurine, a weapon crafted from his own heart's blood, could control others' minds and actions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every sorcerer had their unique trump card, and for Jimbo, it was this figurine. It was the key to his rise as a gray wizard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, facing Alexander, he found his figurine utterly useless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Normally, Alexander should have fallen into an unconscious stupor from the curse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet Alexander looked unfazed, staring at the figurine with piercing intensity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jimbo felt a chill, beads of sweat forming on his forehead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander... hey, this was just a misunderstanding, okay? I'll tell my master all about it and make sure we get along peacefully..." Jimbo forced a pitiful smile at Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander couldn't help but laugh at how shameless Jimbo had become.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A misunderstanding? Didn't you just say you'd make me wish for death?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne, since that sorcery figurine didn't work, you must be a dark wizard, right? That bastard Sebastian hid your strength and status from us!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jimbo switched to a flattering tone, his earlier aggression nowhere to be seen, acting as if he'd always been mild-tempered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The City of Sorcery forbids wizards from harming each other. This is clearly just a misunderstanding. Can't we let bygones be bygones?"</span></p><div class="pagination">
