  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Robert asked cautiously, "Mr. Butler. Mr. Bryant has been in seclusion for so long. How is he now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>John glared at him, displeased. "Robert, don't ask about things you shouldn't know. You're a veteran. How can you make such a basic mistake?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sorry, sorry, I was just concerned... After all, the Red Umbrella Group is getting rather aggressive. They haven't delivered the potential potion they promised us."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Robert frowned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>John snapped, "The Red Umbrella Group is like jackals, even more ruthless than us."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a while, he exhaled deeply and smiled mysteriously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But it doesn't matter. Mr. Bryant's seclusion is going well. Maybe he really can be promoted from a dark wizard to a white wizard. By then, even if the Red Umbrella Group has any conspiracies, we won't have to fear them."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>John warned, "This is a secret. If you leak it, I'll kill you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Robert nodded vigorously. "Yes, Mr. Butler, please rest assured. I don't know anything."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After John left, Robert's face immediately darkened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He opened a secret door and took out a satellite phone. He drafted a message and sent it out, then let out a sigh of relief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a short while, Robert received a reply.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[Operation Dragon Slayer begins. Report immediately after finding Guzman. Do everything to prevent his promotion!]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Robert's body jolted, and his eyes flashed with fierce intent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is Operation Dragon Slayer finally starting?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had been an undercover agent in the Brilliant Group for ten years, waiting for this day.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander brought Alice to the dock for the second time. Due to Alexander's high status, his yacht was now permitted to dock at the side of the pier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The guards at the dock checked Alexander's identity and were all very polite, no longer as arrogant as they had been the day before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The trading center was the core of the Brilliant Group. Although the position of the security supervisor was not high, it was a middle management position. Maybe he could enter the group's senior management in the future.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They left the central square area of the island, which was dirty and chaotic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander brought Alice, who was dressed provocatively and sexy, and she immediately attracted many men with ill intentions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Such a beautiful woman was more attractive to many men than gold or diamonds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though Alexander and Alice came from the square area, there were still many people following them, hiding in the dark, ready to pounce.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't until Alexander brought Alice back to the hotel that those people reluctantly wandered in the distance, hoping for Alexander and Alice to appear again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander deliberately went out for a walk just to show those who were secretly watching him that he was not suspicious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for those rogues who wanted to take advantage of the situation to rob and harass, Alexander ignored them temporarily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From Alexander's room, they could see the trading center opposite.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander had been monitoring the trading center. Since John was going to report to Guzman personally, they could find a breakthrough and dig out Guzman's hiding place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It should be the safest for Guzman to hide in the underground fortress, but it was also possible that he was setting up a false front and actually hiding in an unknown place on the island, which would be more difficult to find.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In addition to monitoring the trading center, Alexander was also fulfilling Alice's wish to get her pregnant as soon as possible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In his excitement, Alexander even pressed Alice against the window and had another thrilling intimacy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The result was that Alice's moans spread throughout half of the building, leading to an increase in the hotel residents' demand for call girls.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They waited until late at night, and John still did not leave the trading center.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Or maybe there was a secret passage in the trading center, and he had quietly left to see Guzman so Alexander could not find it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maybe Guzman was in the underground fortress!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everything was quiet, and the whole island seemed to have fallen asleep.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander decided to investigate personally. He told Alice not to open the door and to take care of herself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Relying on the cover of the night, he approached the trading center quietly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had already figured out the location of the surrounding surveillance cameras during the day, so he easily avoided them all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Guzman had been operating on Treasure Island for more than twenty years. Apart from a small part of the north being controlled by the Red Umbrella Group, most of </span><span>the south was his territory.</span></p><div class="pagination">
