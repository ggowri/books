  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Vanderbilt, where did you go? I couldn't find you anywhere," Jane asked curiously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A hint of cunning showed in Simon's eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I went to the bathroom, so it took a little longer."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"By the way, what did Alexander say? Did he agree to let you take your daughter?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane frowned and curled her lips in anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He didn't, and I don't know why. Did someone slip up?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Simon immediately looked grim.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmph! Anyway, you only have five days left. You can talk to Alexander again."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane felt nervous and scared inside, not knowing what to do.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, Alexander, Ava, and Ashley had arrived to stand in line at the flume ride.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were too many people in line, so Ava and Ashley were playing games in a nearby lounge, and Ashley giggled from time to time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander stood watching them with a smile on his face, his eyes full of love and happiness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Jane coming over, Alexander's smile disappeared, thinking, "This woman follows me everywhere."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava frowned and hugged Ashley tightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What the hell do you want?" Alexander looked furious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane pointed at Ashley and sneered, "Alexander, can't I take my daughter out if I want to? I'm Ashley's mother. Aren't you being overbearing?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Alexander could say anything, Ashley complained, "Mom, I'm going to play with Ava today. You can pick me up some other time, okay?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane was instantly outraged.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ashley, I'm your mom, and Ava is a bitch. She seduced your dad, and that's why your dad and I got divorced."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shut up!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander couldn't stand it anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you have anything, you can talk to me over there. Don't harass them."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"All right. We'll go to the front and talk for a while. I've got to take Ashley, and I have that right as a mother."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane hurried to follow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After the two quickly walked away, Simon instantly sneered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew Alexander was powerful, and it was a great opportunity for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the side of the path ahead, Alexander looked at Jane coldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You can take Ashley, but I'll arrange for someone to stay with her all the time. If you're okay with that, you can take her whenever you want."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander looked calm and condescending, not allowing Jane to reject him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't go too far! Would I sell my daughter?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane inexplicably looked guilty as she said this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander sneered, "You're extremely vain, and your family are even more despicable. You are good at betrayal, so I'll be uneasy."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's enough!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane screamed at the top of her lungs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, who are you to look down on me? Have you forgotten how you flattered me back then?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was extremely upset that the man she could have bullied at will before was suddenly condescending to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you done? I don't want to waste time with you. Still, if you want to pick up Ashley, I'll send someone to follow her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Remember, you and your family would better stop screwing around. Otherwise, even for Sir Fairfax's sake, it won't work this time."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Alexander turned away mercilessly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Son of a bitch! What are you being arrogant about? What's so great about you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane was so angry that she was trembling all over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, a hint of smugness appeared on Simon's face, who was hiding far away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, so what if you're more capable? I will still take your woman away!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dad! Dad, help! Dad, boohoo! There are bad people catching us. Where are you? Ava got caught by the bad guys. Boohoo!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, Ashley's cries came.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Oops!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander suddenly looked panicked as he ran in the direction the faint cries were coming from.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luckily, his hearing was too much better than ordinary people. Otherwise, he wouldn't hear such a subtle cry for help at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The direction from which the cries for help came was a building in the distance. Why did they suddenly go there?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's Force exploded, and he rushed over like a gust of wind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He happened to see Ashley running out of the building while crying and wiping her tears, her face full of fear and looking back every now and then.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop! Little jerk, stop!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Several men with fierce faces chased after her from the building.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They strode forward, trying to grab Ashley with grim smiles on their faces.</span></p><div class="pagination">
