  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wait a minute, I'll be there right away!" Alyssa hung up the phone, but her expression was as solemn as before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What happened?" Alice asked with concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although they had only known each other for a couple of hours, Alice treated this nice lady as her friend.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's okay, just some trivial things..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a forced smile, Alyssa obviously didn't tell the truth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Excuse me, everyone. Please take a rest first. I have something to do." She apologized to them and left in a hurry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Something must have happened. Look at her anxious face," Alexander said with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Xavier was not as leisurely as him. "Alexander, maybe the Mafia has struck her because of us. We have to do something!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Persuading the Axe to sacrifice their lives for them seemed very unrealistic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Xavier is right. Alyssa may betray us. We won't hurt others but have to stay wary all the time. I'll check her situation." Alexander agreed with Xavier's point of view.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Most things in the world could be concluded as a swap of interests. If the Mafia put too much pressure on the Axe or bribed Alyssa with pleasant interests, she could betray them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne is right. Let's see which side Alyssa chooses to stand." Alice also agreed with applying a more cautious tactic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wait here. I'll go to the bathroom."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander winked at Alice, then walked into the bathroom and left through the window.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, in a small villa within the Axe's territory, some people were taking their seats to have a meeting around a table.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The person sitting in the first seat was Alyssa, with a cold expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stanley, think about it carefully and tell us the details of what happened again for </span><span>everyone's clarity." Alyssa looked at a man in his thirties.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stanley looked very fair and attended the meeting in a sports suit with glasses over his nose, which made him look like a humble middle school student.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, those who knew him well knew that despite his pure appearance, his faith in God, and his amicability, anyone who really pissed him off would be torn apart. About thirty people were killed by him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said, "Boss, our undercover agents in other organizations have reported that Paxton is preparing to ally with other gangs to attack us!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Weaver family, Southern Mining and the Glory Association have agreed to form an alliance with him and will start the war for our complete destruction any time now. It's very urgent."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The anxiety made his gentle face look so grim.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alyssa slammed the table in anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How dare these bastards treat us as sheep!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone </span><span>present</span><span> had a very solemn expression. The Mafia alone was stronger than them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Its allies were as powerful as the Axe and sometimes could even overshadow them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Five oligarchs of the gem trade in Mandale Town were the Mafia, the Weaver family, Southern Mining, the Glory Association, and the Axe, which was the weakest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now that the Mafia had allied with the other three giants, plus some small gangs that would like to carve the Axe up, they were too vulnerable to their attacks. Everyone present was worrying about their doom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clenching her teeth, Alyssa was contemplating the best solution.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a while, an astonishing courage burst out from her. Rather than being intimidated and choosing to surrender, she made up her mind to preserve herself by resisting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Axe will tell the Mafia that we're wolves!" she roared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It greatly boosted morale.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If they want our lives and our money, let's see who is with more guts! They will come back with countless bodies of their people!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah! We shall fight till the last minute to prove our courage! Our enemies will pay for their contemptuous behavior."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, Stanley received a call.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He put on a speakerphone, only to hear some screams.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, shit!" Stanley's face changed drastically.</span></p><div class="pagination">
