Meilin's breasts were so elastic and smooth like cream.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She deserved the title of goddess-level policewoman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is Ms. Purnell really closely related to the Red Umbrella Group?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander pondered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He believed that Meilin would not lie. If Ella was a member of the Red Umbrella Group, Ashley would be in danger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The more Alexander thought about it, the more he felt something was wrong, and his face changed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, his cell phone rang.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as the call was connected, Alice shouted anxiously, "Mr. Hawthorne, Lily is </span><span>in trouble..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was suddenly startled and his face changed drastically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it, you're looking for death!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before he hung up the call, he exerted the Force and rushed out like a gust of wind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Along the way, a hurricane was stirred up wherever Alexander passed by, and everyone could only see a vague shadow that appeared and disappeared like lightning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The news of the appearance of Superman quickly caused a sensation in </span><span>Loscity</span><span>!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The journey that originally took more than 20 minutes took Alexander less than three minutes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This speed was terrifying, and Alexander also consumed a lot of Force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Alexander rushed to the door of Lily's villa, he saw it was wide open.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two bodyguards had already fallen in a pool of blood. One of them was holding a cell phone tightly in his hand. He must have been the one who alerted Alice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Several burly men were dragging Lily out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bowman took a towel and stuffed it into Lily's arms while several other guys twisted Lily's hands, making her unable to move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hurry up!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bowman urged loudly. He had never expected that Alexander would come so soon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander shouted angrily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, why are you here? They are kidnappers. Run! Don't worry about me, just run!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily shouted anxiously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>So</span><span> you are Alexander. Just stand there and don't move, or I'll kill her!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bowman grinned grimly, with the muzzle of the gun pointed at Lily's head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You deserve to die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was furious; his Force exploded, and he slammed into Bowman like a cannonball.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bowman was suddenly shocked and was about to pull the trigger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, before he could exert any force with his fingers, Alexander slapped him in the face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bowman screamed and flew several meters away, falling heavily to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander hit Bowman in anger. If he hadn't wanted to leave Bowman alive, Bowman's head would have burst like a broken watermelon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Go! I'll give you double the pay, come on!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bowman started shouting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those strong men were extremely excited and pounced on Alexander like hungry wolves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander raised his hand and punched, knocking one of them away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He kicked another man, and the man flew sideways. His body hit the wall hard, making a loud vibration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander hated these kidnappers so much that he knocked them all down with just a few punches and kicks. Even if they didn't die, they were seriously injured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He supported Lily and pulled the towel out of her mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lily, are you okay?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, I'm fine. Luckily, you came quickly..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily's face was pale, and she was crying tremblingly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, I'm sorry, I've implicated you again!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lily!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was deeply moved. Even though Lily was so scared, she still cared about him so much.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lily, it's okay. They deserved to be beaten. I will take care of it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander took out his cell phone and called Alice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I have subdued the kidnapper. Bring someone over to deal with it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alice's heart suddenly trembled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay, don't worry, Mr. Hawthorne. I'll be there soon!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After hanging up the phone, Alexander comforted Lily for a while before walking towards Bowman, who was half dead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily looked at Alexander's tall back, and tears filled her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander has grown up and can protect me..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander stepped on Bowman's chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He asked coldly, "Who sent you here? If you don't tell me, you will die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bowman screamed in pain and almost suffocated. His sternum and ribs were also creaking as if they could not bear the weight and would break in the next second.</span></p><div class="pagination">
