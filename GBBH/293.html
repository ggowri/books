  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For them, women were trophies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two men tiptoed from both sides, their breathing quickening with excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were thrilled and hungry as they approached their beautiful prey.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They imagined capturing Melin, making her kneel, and forcing her to beg for mercy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their desires erupted like a volcano.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander, on the rooftop, saw everything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two men even signaled to Alexander to keep an eye on Melin and not let her escape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melin was focused on the factory where Rosen and the others were, unaware of the danger behind her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She quietly moved to the door, adjusting her breath, ready to rush in and capture Rosen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, two cold gun barrels pressed against her body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A chilling voice whispered in her ear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Drop your gun and put your hands on your head! Don't try anything funny. We have many people. You can't win."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melin froze, unable to move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though she had a gun, she was now controlled by them. She dropped her gun and crouched, hands on her head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two men started to search her, taking advantage of the situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bastards, what are you doing?" Melin cursed, trying to struggle free, but it was useless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shut up!" one of the men snapped, grabbing her chin. "You're our captive now. Keep quiet if you don't want to die."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melin glared at them, speechless with anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two men ignored her angry look and continued to search her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't move!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Melin's resistance became fierce, they handcuffed her hands behind her back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm a police officer. Let me go!" Melin struggled in vain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because of the handcuffs, she was forced to stick out her chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wow, they're huge!" The two men reached out their hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melin winced in pain, almost crying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This commotion alerted Rosen inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What are you two doing?" he shouted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Reporting, sir, we caught a female cop sneaking in. We're bringing her to you for questioning," they replied, pushing Melin inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosen was amazed by Melin's beauty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Haha, just a female cop, and she dares to interfere with us? She's got guts," he laughed, looking Melin up and down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then he carefully searched her, removing her hairpin, belt, uniform, and boots, fearing she might have a tracking device.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, he found a bobby pin in Melin's pink underwear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She could use that to unlock the cuffs, but now she was desperate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, Melin's uniform was stripped off, leaving her in a pair of bras and panties.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her bra was a half-cup, barely covering the lower half. They swayed as she breathed heavily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosen and his men swallowed hard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Alexander, who quietly appeared at the window, couldn't help but look a few times.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melin's figure was as good as Ava's and Betty's.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosen waved his hand. "Put a blindfold on her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, sir!" Someone immediately placed a thick cloth over Melin's eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then he made her kneel on the ground.</span></p><div class="pagination">
