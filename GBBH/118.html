  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Brilliant Group had set exorbitant fees for its distributors. The starting price for a state-level distributor was two billion dollars, while city-level fees varied based on population, beginning in the hundreds of millions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And this was just the deposit. Merchandise costs were additional, and they would have to split their profits with the Brilliant Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite these harsh terms, people scrambled for a chance to secure distribution rights.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, landing a distribution deal would bring immense profits and, through the power of magic powder, greatly enhance their own influence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava arrived just in time to see the scene. Her face turned pale as dread filled her heart, feeling that all hope was lost.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Orion, on the other hand, was delighted to see Ava. He still had a wager going with Alexander, and judging by the situation, he was confident he had won.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Blackburn, where's Alexander?" he taunted. "Didn't he bet he could make the Saint Group the exclusive distributor for magic powder?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lara</span><span> sneered. "That lying scoundrel Alexander! Where is he now? Did he run off?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Alexander pushed through the crowd, smiling as he walked toward Ava.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing him, Ava felt a mixture of relief and frustration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She pressed a bank card into his hand, her voice low. "There's ten million dollars on this card. Take it and leave </span><span>Loscity</span><span>. Sebastian won't let you walk out of here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was taken aback and asked, "Why would I leave?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Orion gave a scornful laugh. "Are you blind? Can't you see the Brilliant Group has the exclusive distribution rights for magic powder? Soon, all of </span><span>Loscity</span><span> will bow to them. You crippled Evan; if you don't flee, you're as good as dead."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Not to mention," he added with a triumphant sneer, "you lost our wager, so you have to give up Ms. Blackburn."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander just chuckled </span><span>calmly,</span><span> his voice unwavering. "It's too early to draw conclusions. The Saint Group will become the exclusive distributor for magic powder."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lara</span><span>, unable to restrain herself, spat on the ground in front of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, give it a rest. Ava, can't you see how unreliable this guy is?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava didn't know how to respond. She, too, felt let down by Alexander's apparent lack of results.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Please," she urged, giving him a desperate push. "You need to leave now, before it's too late."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, don't even think about running!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A voice, thick with scorn, rang out suddenly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander knew it was Jane's voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He turned and saw Sebastian, Jane, Andrew, and other members of the Fairfax family, along with a crowd of men in black, closing in on him like a dark storm cloud.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane's face twisted with hatred as she shouted at him, "Did you think you could just flee now that the Brilliant Group is the exclusive distributor for magic powder? From this day on, the Brilliant Group's influence will spread nationwide along with magic powder."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No matter where you go, you won't escape!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander felt a surge of amusement. He hadn't expected them still to be oblivious to the fact that Jackson was a fraud.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava quickly stepped forward. "Mr. Sebastian Tate, could you grant me this one favor? I'll cover Mr. Evan Tate's medical expenses. Whatever compensation you want, I'll pay it. Just please, leave Alexander out of this."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian suddenly burst into laughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ava, the Saint Group can barely save itself, and you're here pleading for him? What could you possibly offer? If I take down Alexander, the entire Saint Group will be mine."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava didn't pick up on the meaning behind Sebastian's words, but </span><span>Lara</span><span>'s eyes narrowed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought to herself, "Why did Sebastian say that taking down Alexander would hand him control of the Saint Group? What's behind this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian pointed at Alexander, his voice dripping with malice. "You're finished, </span><span>Alexander! Drake, the sorcerer from the City of Sorcery, will be here soon. Today, no one can save you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now that he held the exclusive rights to magic powder and had Drake's assistance, Sebastian felt unstoppable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was one of his rivals for the title of Godfather, and Sebastian had long dreamed of eliminating him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He believed that no one would help Alexander and Ava; after all, no one would dare stand against him now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane's expression lit with glee.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, Alexander, don't you regret refusing me back then? You're nothing but a loser!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Fairfax family members watched eagerly, anticipating Alexander's downfall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a sharp order from Ava, Max immediately led members of the Saint Group forward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sebastian, as long as I'm here, you won't touch Alexander, and you won't get your hands on the Saint Group!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
