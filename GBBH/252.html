  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man was the closest one to Guzman. He was in the first row. It was obvious that he had a very high status in the Bryant family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He walked towards Guzman quietly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone was kneeling on the ground praying and didn't notice what was happening at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man moved silently, approaching Guzman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was obvious that he was very skilled, like a cheetah on the prowl, ready to launch a fatal attack on its prey at any time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Great Witch God, you..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Guzman's tone rose and fell. He was so focused on praying that he didn't notice the man approaching.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, the man was only two or three meters away from Guzman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He smiled ferociously and pulled out a pistol to target Guzman's back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man would open fire in the next second. Guzman seemed unaware and was still praying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Witch God, your glory will surely spread throughout the world..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Guzman's voice suddenly became louder and louder, and the tone became more and more rhythmic, even turning into a roar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man was the first to be affected. His body immediately shook uncontrollably. He became extremely terrified.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He tried desperately to pull the trigger, but his body was so stiff that he couldn't do it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man roared angrily. The muscles of his right arm contracted and bulged. He used all his strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had strong muscles. But under the influence of Guzman's witchcraft, he couldn't pull the trigger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Guzman turned around and glared at the man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes were bloody red, filling with murderous intent and anger. He looked like a beast.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Jack, why do you want to kill me? I trust you so much. Why do you want to kill me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Guzman questioned. His tone sounded calm but terrifying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Facing Guzman, Jack still did not surrender or retreat. There was not even a trace of fear or terror in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What a bullshit Witch God! You killed my son, and I will kill you today!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jack cursed. He held the gun with both hands, trying to pull the trigger with all his strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Jack, your son is qualified to be a sacrifice and contribute to our rise. You should feel honored. Why are you so angry?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Guzman's words were ruthless and terrifying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You are a devil... I don't believe in any damn Witch </span><span>God,</span><span> you are a damn devil! </span><span>Everyone, help me kill him, otherwise he will destroy our entire family."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jack shouted with all his might, but no one dared to respond to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Guzman waved Ancestral Witch's Cane. Jack's hands holding the gun quickly turned black and exploded like old bark.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jack screamed. His hands looked like charcoal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing such a horrifying scene, everyone present stepped back, fearing that they would be affected by Jack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jack fell to the ground and curled up in pain. However, he still refused to give in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Guzman, you are a devil, someone will kill you! God will punish you. You heretic! You devil!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jack kept yelling and cursing. He wanted to avenge, but he was no longer able to do so.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His miserable shouting and cursing were full of helplessness, unwillingness, and anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Jack, I treat you like my family. I trust you, but you betrayed me for your son."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Guzman sneered with contempt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's just a child. You are so rich. You can find as many women as you want to have as many children as you want. I can't understand why you betrayed me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hahaha!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jack suddenly burst into laughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Guzman, because you are a eunuch, and you have been ruined by those women, you will never understand the meaning of the word 'father'."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Guzman was angry. "You! Dare you to repeat it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jack sneered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I said you are a eunuch. You were ruined by those women... You will never have your children in this life... You are not a man. You are trash..."</span></p><div class="pagination">
