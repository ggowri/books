  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Very good. You don't have to worry about the Mafia. I will send people to support you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander nodded with satisfaction, then turned and walked towards the villa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alyssa looked at Alexander with mixed feelings. He had an incomparable charm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If she could exchange the Axe for Alexander's loyalty, she would agree immediately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What a pity..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alyssa sighed, knowing that her idea was impossible to achieve.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the villa, Alice and Xavier were anxiously waiting for Alexander to come back. After all, he was alone in hunting down the enemy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Alexander, they both breathed a sigh of relief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander decided to return to </span><span>Loscity</span><span> as soon as possible. His purpose of coming to </span><span>Mandale</span><span> Town had been achieved, and his lightsaber had been upgraded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On Treasure Island, the Red Umbrella Group's magic circle was being built at an accelerated pace. And Alexander received reports from Augusta every day.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix, who was hiding in the darkness, would soon appear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander would never feel at ease until this problem was solved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That night, Alexander asked Alyssa and Beverly to come to his room together.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two women came to the door with complicated expressions. They knocked on the door, but there was no answer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alyssa frowned and said, "What happened?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you afraid that your master doesn't want you anymore?" Beverly said with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alyssa glared at Beverly and said nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They couldn't help but push the door open and were stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They saw pieces of clothes thrown on the floor, all the way to the bedroom door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They opened the bedroom door. There was a sexy black underwear on the floor. The bed was messy, but no one was there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah... well... So good. I'm dying..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A delicate female voice came from the half-open bathroom door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two women looked at each other and couldn't help but smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without saying anything, they began to take off their clothes. They secretly wanted to see who could win Alexander's favor more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the bathroom, Alice lay on the edge of the bathtub with her buttocks raised high, moaning and looking back from time to time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander lay on her back, with their lower bodies tightly connected. He rubbed her </span><span>breasts with his hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her breasts were too big to hold with one hand. Alexander's fingers sink into them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander never stopped and made Alice so happy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this time, two naked women walked in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smiled, kissed Alice on the neck, and said, "Your reinforcements are here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alice, with a blushing face, looked at the two women with a dazed look and said, "Yeah! Help me... But it feels so good..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beverly and Alyssa had already become jealous. And they hugged Alexander from the left and right, kissing and caressing him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Master, stop bullying Alice. Let me do it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beverly turned around and leaned on the edge of the bathtub with her hands like Alice. She raised her buttocks and swayed them seductively. She turned around and teased Alexander with a charming look.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alice looked tired. Alexander walked behind Beverly and touched her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alice collapsed on the floor, panting weakly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She said, "Amazing. I've already had three orgasms."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beverly and Alyssa heard this, and didn't feel scared, but became more excited.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander did not attack Beverly immediately but pulled Alyssa into his arms and gave her a deep kiss.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said, "You missed me, didn't you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alyssa said, "Well, I miss you. I think of you all the time..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She hugged Alexander tightly and took the initiative to kiss him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beverly became angry, came over with a pout, and took the initiative to rub Alexander's genitals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Master, I miss you, too."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander didn't snub any of the three women.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He turned around and hugged Alice again. Alexander rubbed Alice's and Alyssa's buttocks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They kissed Alexander unconsciously and gently caressed his chest.</span></p><div class="pagination">
