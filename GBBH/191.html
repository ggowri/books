Did you take a wrong turn?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava's heart raced, and she coldly asked, "Dominic, what do you think you're doing? This isn't the way</span><span> home</span><span>!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the driver ignored her, as if he were deaf.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava's back was already soaked with cold sweat, and the effects of the alcohol had </span><span>been replaced by</span><span> shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're not Dominic! Stop the car now, or I'll call the police!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava quickly took out her phone, ready to </span><span>call</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, the driver slammed on the brakes</span><span>. </span><span>Ava crashed hard against the backrest, losing her phone somewhere.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The car had stopped; they were clearly in a remote area with no one around, surrounded only by eerie, dark woods and shrubs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get out!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A cold voice rang out as Ava was dragged out of the car by the driver.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're not Dominic. Who are you? I'm the president of the Saint Group, and I advise you not to mess around."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite her messy appearance, Ava didn't lose her cool; instead, she focused on protecting herself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This driver looked just like Dominic but was definitely not him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In her fear, Ava suddenly thought of Alexander, and</span><span> </span><span>tears rolled down her cheeks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I know you're Ava; </span><span>and</span><span> I'm looking for</span><span> you</span><span>."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The driver chuckled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What do you want?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava slowly backed away, looking for a chance to escape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sudden turn left her feeling helpless, but it was remarkable that she could still keep calm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmph! Ava, can't you recognize my voice?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The driver sneered, feeling his neck a few times, then surprisingly rubbed off a layer of skin to reveal a thin, translucent mask of a human face, tossing it in front of Ava.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Gary?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava stared at him in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She never expected that the head of the Federer family would come to kidnap her</span><span> himself</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I heard your family developed a new generation of facial masks</span><span> that look like real human faces</span><span>; I didn't think it was true. </span><span>Seems like I was wrong.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava knew Gary was targeting Alexander and seeking revenge for David, and her palms and soles were now sweating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her curvy, sensual body trembled slightly, and the fear in her expression added a different kind of beauty that made one feel pity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gary approached slowly, like a cat playing with a mouse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander </span><span>killed</span><span> David</span><span> </span><span>and </span><span>even</span><span> dared to go against me publicly. I'll start by </span><span>punishing</span><span> you since you're involved with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Blackburn, you dress so seductively every day; you must be good in bed, right? Come here and serve me well, and maybe I'll spare your life."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He grinned wickedly, reaching out to hug Ava.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get away!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava cursed angrily as she quickly backed away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't expect Gary, who usually dressed </span><span>like a decent man</span><span>, to be such a pervert; his eyes filled with desire and hatred </span><span>made him an evil</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Gary, you're trash! If you have the guts, go take it up with Alexander instead of sneakily impersonating a driver to kidnap me. Are you even a man?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava aimed to provoke Gary to create an opportunity for </span><span>escape</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hahaha..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gary laughed wildly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Blackburn, you're clever; you think you can anger me to find an opportunity, huh? But let me tell you, I won't fall for that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I want Alexander to pain, starting with you, and then his half-dead daughter in the hospital!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You beast, you even go after little girls!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava scolded as she took steps backward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gary remained calm; he loved the feeling of being in control, washing away the humiliation Alexander had caused him before.</span></p><div class="pagination">
