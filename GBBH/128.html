  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the legends, gods, elves, even demons from hell, or superhumans with incredible powers, were all high-dimensional beings of great abilities. And </span><span>they </span><span>were not far behind </span><span>compared with </span><span>the powerful Warriors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander approached one of the most critical patients and began using the Force to heal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Force flowed through the patient's body, forming a vortex that generated a mysterious pull.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the vortex spun faster, its pull intensified.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava watched nervously. No one dared disturb Alexander, all silently watching, filled with anticipation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, Alexander sensed a dark liquid within the Force vortex.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the Force purified the toxin, wisps of black smoke began to rise from the patient's body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Within less than half a minute, the patient stopped crying in pain, relaxed, and </span><span>his</span><span> once darkened complexion returned to normal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vincent was astounded. "How did you do that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To him, it seemed as if Alexander had simply placed his hand on the patient, done nothing, and the patient was suddenly cured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he had seen this in a church, Vincent would have thought it a miracle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing that the Force healing worked, Alexander wasted no time, moving from one critical patient to the next.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In no time, a dozen severely poisoned patients were restored to health.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you, Mr. Hawthorne!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you, Mr. Hawthorne. We're eternally grateful!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They sincerely expressed their gratitude to Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After each recovery, cheers and applause filled the room. However, Alexander felt a sense of pressure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As more patients were healed, he felt his energy was drained out, sweat soaking through his clothes. Yet, those in critical condition needed to be saved. Otherwise, the Saint Group would face disaster</span><span> if anyone died</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before he knew it, evening had come.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian and Evan sat in wheelchairs, each pushed by assistants, as a group stood waiting by the roadside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dad, is Mr. Drake really a dark wizard?" Evan couldn't help but ask.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian groaned, massaging his head and warning. "Evan, when Mr. Drake arrives, don't even think about asking that. If you upset him, I won't be able to save you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan frowned, muttering, "Why couldn't he just take a flight? Why are we waiting here? It's been nearly two hours, and still no sign of Mr. Drake. Did he back out?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian's brows furrowed, his patience already worn thin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His head throbbed painfully, and he desperately hoped this dark wizard could relieve him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But after waiting for nearly two hours with no sign of Drake, he was already losing hope.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, one of his men pointed and gasped. "Is that someone over there?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone looked in the direction he pointed, spotting a black figure, ghostly, a hundred meters away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the next instant, the shadow appeared in front of them, startling them all back a few steps.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Am I seeing things?" Sebastian rubbed his eyes in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How could anyone move so fast, like lightning, and so silently, like a phantom?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All were wide-eyed with terror, too afraid to make a sound.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian's voice trembled as he asked, "Are you Mr. Drake?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, I am." The visitor's voice was hoarse and gravelly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was tall, cloaked in black, entirely hidden in shadow, with no intention of revealing his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Drake looked over at Sebastian, who was visibly in pain, and pulled out a black beetle, holding it in his palm. "Swallow this, and the pain will stop temporarily."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Really?" Sebastian's face showed a mixture of relief and fear as he looked at the beetle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The peanut-sized beetle had a black shell with white spots, antennae, and eight long legs, looking quite </span><span>disgusting</span><span>.</span></p><div class="pagination">
