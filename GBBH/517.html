  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Felix hesitate, Diego sneered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Vanderbilt, you're in a precarious position. Plus, you're responsible for Raven's death, so giving up half your shares is only fair."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix's face darkened; even if he could kill Alexander, losing half his shares would mean losing his position as Chairman of the Red Umbrella Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Morris, don't you think your family's demands are a bit excessive?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shut up!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The woman beside him snapped angrily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Remember, you must always show respect before the Morris family."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The mighty Chairman of the Red Umbrella Group, Felix, was being scolded by one of Barry's secretaries, and it infuriated him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Morris!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix, in need of their help, held back his anger, turning to Barry with a pleading look, almost like a dog begging for scraps.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Heh..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barry smirked, an enigmatic smile spreading across his face as he spoke slowly. "Mr. Vanderbilt, if you're unwilling to part with half your shares, there's one last option."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What is it? Please, Mr. Morris, tell me. If it's within my power, I won't hesitate!" Felix asked, barely containing his impatience.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"First, once Alexander is dead, the magic powder formula must go to the Morris family. Second, you must give us at least ten percent of Red Umbrella Group's shares."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barry looked at Felix haughtily, waiting for his response.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix hesitated for a moment, secretly smirking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As long as the Morris family could kill Alexander, he'd be the sole heir and take the Godfather's place, his power soaring; what would he have to fear from the Morris family then?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just his Shadow alone could give the Morris family plenty to worry about!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fine! If you can take down Alexander and secure the formula, everything of his is yours.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"However, I've already transferred some shares to Mr. Wallace, so I can only offer five percent to the Morris family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If that's not enough, I'll look for help elsewhere."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After presenting his terms, Felix acted as if he were about to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fine! Then we're agreed," Barry replied, a satisfied smile growing on his face, realizing Felix was wise enough to concede some benefits.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was a big fish; his magic powder and beauty cream were wildly popular in multiple states and were starting to make an impression internationally.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, the annual profits from magic powder alone would exceed 50 billion dollars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Vanderbilt, my son Raven died for the Red Umbrella Group; don't you think I deserve some compensation? Nothing too much. One billion or 800 million should do, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barry made an outrageous demand, but he seemed to think it perfectly reasonable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What? One billion or 800 million?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix's face twisted again as he glared fiercely at Barry, anger blazing in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What? Are you saying my son isn't worth that much?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barry stared coldly at Felix.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diego, Joyce, and the other Morris family looked at Felix with icy stares, their eyes filled with dominance and murderous intent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix remained silent, and the room was completely still.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone's eyes were on Felix, waiting for his answer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix gritted his teeth, knowing the Morris family was determined to bleed him dry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On one hand, without the Morris family' support, he couldn't kill Alexander or solve his current crisis.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the other hand, Barry's demand of one billion or 800 million stung him; after all, no one's money just fell from the sky.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Felix hesitate, the killing intent in Barry's eyes grew more intense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Powerful presences gathered around him, all targeting Felix.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diego raised his eyes, looking at Felix as if by chance, his fists slowly clenching.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix chuckled bitterly; if he refused, it was clear Barry would strike. The Morris family was even more shameless than he was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barry asked, expressionless, "So, Mr. Vanderbilt, have you made up your mind? One billion or 800 million is nothing to you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you won't do this willingly, then don't blame me if my son's death goes unavenged..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was a blatant threat. Barry didn't bother hiding his disdain for Felix, making it </span><span>clear he thought he had Felix cornered.</span></p><div class="pagination">
