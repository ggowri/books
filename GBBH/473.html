  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander caressed Ava for a good while until she was panting, her body completely limp in his arms. Only then did he reluctantly pull his hand back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Heh, let's go, time for the auction."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're such a jerk, getting all satisfied while leaving me all flustered."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava gave Alexander a playful pinch on the cheek.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though she sounded annoyed, there was something enticing about her, a mix of protest and temptation. Alexander laughed in delight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two of them quickly got dressed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander threw on a casual tracksuit, pairing it with white sneakers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite the simple outfit, he had an unmistakable charisma, an effortless masculinity that was impossible to ignore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava looked Alexander up and down, her eyes practically sparkling. Compared to when they first met, his aura had completely transformed&mdash;it was something she couldn't quite put into words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was, in fact, the result of Alexander's growing power, which naturally affected his presence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Alexander also looked at Ava.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wore a white dress that hugged her curves, emphasizing her voluptuous figure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her ample chest strained against the buttons as if they might pop open at any moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The combination of sensual allure and Ava's commanding aura as a CEO made her irresistibly attractive&mdash;Alexander couldn't look away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They looked at each other in the mirror&mdash;truly a perfect match, like they were made for each other.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava glanced at her phone. "My mom's already at the venue; she's part of the auction committee."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, let's go."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a quick breakfast at the hotel, they headed to the exhibition center.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The place was already crowded, and the parking lot was almost full. Rolls-Royces, Bentleys, Ferraris, Porsches&mdash;luxury cars were everywhere.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was clear that a lot of wealthy people had come for the auction&mdash;competition would be fierce.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Alexander didn't care. He now owned the Saint Group and had taken over the Brilliant Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Besides the magic powder, he now had a hot-selling beauty product under his belt, giving him billions in liquid assets.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, Alexander was full of confidence&mdash;no matter how many rich people showed up, he was richer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unless someone on the level of a top billionaire or a Godfather-level kingpin stepped in, Alexander wasn't worried.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander finally found an empty parking spot and quickly pulled in. But just as he stepped out of the car...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A familiar voice started yelling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, you son of a bitch! You stole my parking spot, didn't you?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nate Sullivan came storming out of a black BMW, angrily pointing at Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's expression turned icy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Nate, I didn't see your car when I got here. It's not your spot&mdash;whoever gets in first gets it. If you're upset, blame your lousy driving skills."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nate's face flushed red, and he had no comeback.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava let out a disdainful snort.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You already lost the weightlifting challenge. A loser should know his place. According to the bet, you were supposed to never show up in front of us again."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You... you two are too much! Are you saying I can't even attend the auction?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nate was shaking with anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A liar and a sore loser!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander shook his head, too annoyed to bother. He wrapped an arm around Ava's waist and started walking away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Nate wasn't ready to give up yet. He quickly stepped in front of Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Think you can just walk away? Not so fast!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What do you want?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's lips curled into a smirk of disdain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, move your crappy car out of my spot! Or else, you'll regret it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nate waved his hand, and two large men stepped out of his car, flanking him on either side.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, if you don't want a beating, move your car now. Otherwise, I'll show you what I can do!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander looked at the three of them and actually laughed from anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Nate, are you out of your mind? I got here first! They say a smart dog doesn't block the way. If you don't want to get hurt, get lost."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nate let out a heavy snort.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, either drive your crappy car out of here, or let Ava spend the night with me. What's it </span><span>gonna</span><span> be? Otherwise, I'll make you regret it..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, he leered at Ava's chest, his expression absolutely disgusting.</span></p><div class="pagination">
