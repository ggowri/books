  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Go to hell!" Fernando suddenly snapped, lunging to strike Alexander's crotch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was faster, though. His foot connected with Fernando's face in a brutal kick. The impact sent Fernando flying backward with an agonized scream. He crumpled to the ground, his face caved in, and blood gushing from his mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Looks like we won't be getting anything out of him," Alexander said coldly, staring at Fernando's lifeless body. "The Sakra Society's test subjects are absolutely loyal thanks to those enhancement drugs."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quentin growled in frustration. "Then we'll have to search this whole damn base. Maybe we'll get lucky and find the pure Immortality Serum."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Back off!" Alexander suddenly spun around, unleashing a blast of the Force. The base members who had tried to ambush him went flying, hitting the ground hard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fernando's death had broken everyone's spirit. The remaining base personnel scattered in panic, but there was nowhere to run.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The entire facility was surrounded, with only two exits that were both heavily guarded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The strike team took complete control of the base in less than an hour.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Alexander hadn't been there, they would have faced one hell of a fight. But by taking out most of the guards and Fernando himself, Alexander had basically sealed their victory before it even began.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quentin split up his team; some stayed behind to clean up the base while the rest spread out for a thorough sweep. They hadn't hit their main objective yet. Without the pure Immortality Serum in their hands, taking down the base would only count as half a win.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander kicked his heightened senses into high gear as he searched the place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he reached a quiet corridor deep in the base, something caught his attention as he narrowed his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the end of the hallway was an empty room that other teams had already checked and cleared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stepped inside, scanning every corner before sternly calling out, "You can come out now. I know you're in here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The room remained dead silent, with Alexander as the only visible person inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He let out a cold laugh. "Look, hiding won't do you any good. Make this easy on yourself and come out. Trust me. You don't want me to drag you out the hard way."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I... I'll come out. Please don't kill me," a shaky voice responded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A young guy, probably in his early twenties, stumbled out of the closet. Blood was seeping from a wound in his chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Apparently, he'd caught a hit from the strike team earlier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had guts, though. He'd managed to keep quiet enough to fool the first search team into thinking the room was empty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander finally spotted him, and there was nowhere left to hide. He had no choice but to come out, shaking like a leaf.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He kept his head down, too scared to meet Alexander's eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, he'd seen Alexander kill Fernando in front of everyone. That memory alone was enough to kill any thought of resistance. All he wanted was to make it out alive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's your name? Why are you hiding here?" Alexander's voice was cold as ice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I-I'm Kylian Daxton</span><span>,</span><span> Fernando's assistant." Kylian gave a bitter smile. Playing along was his only shot at survival.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fernando's assistant, huh?" Alexander studied Kylian's face for any signs of deception. "Do you know where the pure Immortality Serum is stored?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kylian stayed quiet for what felt like forever. Alexander was about to write him off as useless when he finally spoke up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't know if there's any pure Immortality Serum in the base, but I do know one of Fernando's secrets."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh?" Alexander's interest peaked instantly. Any secret of Fernando's had to be connected to the Sakra Society.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I wasn't supposed to know about this," Kylian said. "But one night Fernando had way too much to drink and couldn't stop mumbling about it...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"When I listened carefully, he kept repeating this string of numbers over and over. I'm sure it must be the code to some important room in the base."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kylian shared the sequence with Alexander. He then dropped to his knees, begging for mercy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you know which room it opens? Could it be Fernando's secret vault?" Alexander pressed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I... I've told you everything I know. I swear I'm not hiding anything else. Please, just spare my life." Kylian looked up at Alexander with desperation in his eyes.</span></p><div class="pagination">
