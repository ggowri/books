  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Schroder was suddenly overjoyed, arrogantly threatening. "The police are already here. If you lay a finger on me, you'll regret it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander looked at him with disdain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Rosen already revealed that you're the mastermind behind the kidnapping. You've been caught red-handed. What else is there to say? Just wait for your military tribunal!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Schroder refused to back down. "This is slander! Northern Command won't allow me </span><span>to be defamed. You won't get away with this!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You really think Mr. Thompson will help you? Besides, do you think I'll let you escape easily? If I don't eliminate the root of the problem, it'll just come back to haunt me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Alexander slapped Schroder on the forehead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A surge of the Force rushed in, twisting like a knife in his head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Schroder collapsed to the ground, clutching his head and convulsing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander watched him expressionlessly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is your fate&mdash;worse than death."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let&rsquo;s go!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander ignored Jane and turned to leave with his men.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't care what Jane and Andrew would tell the police. The priority was to help Quentin's grandson recover and gain his support.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane cried as she rushed after him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stopped, frowning at her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm sorry. It took me until today to realize how wrong I was. Please forgive me..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane sobbed, apologizing to Alexander with all her heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked at his ex-wife in astonishment, surprised she had come to apologize. It seemed she had been bullied by Schroder and had woken up to reality.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, for Ashley's sake, is there any chance we could go back to how things were?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane asked with hopeful eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander sighed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's too late. But you will always be Ashley's mother. I hope you can come when she gets out of the hospital."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he quickened his pace and left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Behind him, Jane's desperate cries echoed, but Alexander's heart had turned to stone. They couldn't go back anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could let go but couldn't forget the betrayal and humiliation Jane had inflicted upon him, like a shattered mirror with cracks that would never heal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With tear-filled eyes, Jane watched </span><span>Alexander walk</span><span> away, feeling utterly defeated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She knew she had lost this man forever...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Outside the estate, Alexander was surprised to find that not only the police had arrived, but also a group of fully armed soldiers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Oliver was grinning as he tried to appease Quentin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Respected General Thompson, Schroder is fine. He just had a headache and was sent to the hospital."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quentin let out a long sigh of relief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's good that he's alive. Whether General Flores is guilty or not will be determined by a military tribunal. Everything hinges on the evidence."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he said "evidence," he looked seriously at Alexander, his meaning clear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander replied confidently, "Mr. Thompson, I'm ready. We can head to </span><span>Tijuanea</span><span> to </span><span>help your grandson anytime."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quentin smiled and nodded with satisfaction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Very good. I knew Mr. Hawthorne was a great man. If Schroder really was behind the kidnapping, he must be severely punished!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Make sure to investigate thoroughly. We need to get to the bottom of this." He commanded earnestly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Oliver eagerly agreed, nodding knowingly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander merely smiled, noncommittal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Force could save lives but also take them. The Force tormenting Schroder would leave him worse than dead, and he wouldn't last much longer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Oliver leaned in and whispered, "Mr. Hawthorne, did you know that Schroder has close ties with the Red Umbrella Group?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander frowned. "Not really. What intel do you have?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Oliver hurriedly leaned closer, saying, "Schroder came to </span><span>Loscity</span><span> pretending to convey orders from the military, mainly due to the Red Umbrella Group stirring the pot. They're also helping Orion become the head of the Hansen family."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Although Orion is under house arrest for the murder of Mr. Ralph Hansen, we must be cautious of the Red Umbrella Group's power. Mr. Hawthorne, you have a good relationship with Miss Hansen, right? "</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He flashed a knowing smile that men understood, clearly envious of Alexander's luck with women.</span></p><div class="pagination">
