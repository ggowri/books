  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cleveland glanced at Donald and said, "That kid has probably become a Level-One Warrior in martial arts."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So soon? He's only been in the Dominion Church for a few months! Is he some kind of prodigy? No... that's impossible! The Head Priest Hezekiah must be backing him..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donald felt uneasy. If the Head Priest Hezekiah was really protecting that boy, things would get complicated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Donald's hesitation, Cleveland made up his mind. Since he could never train again, he had to get his revenge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Donald, Head Priest Hezekiah! Those two are just slaves. Why would the Head Priest Hezekiah protect them? They must have trained in Risun before they joined the church. Then the Head Priest Hezekiah blessed them, which is how they reached Level-One Warrior."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They hate you, Head Priest Hezekiah. If you don't get rid of them now, they'll come for you again. And by then, they'll be even harder to deal with."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cleveland sneered and added, "Last time my sister saw you, she couldn't stop thinking about you. She admires you deeply and is willing to offer herself to you... to cultivate alongside you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Really? That girl is indeed charming... Alright, since those two fools are asking for death, we will..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Good, good! I'll follow your lead."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cleveland finally felt at ease.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Three months had passed since Alexander arrived in Sahasia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was the golden autumn season, and the Verdant Crown Melons were ripe. It was time for the harvest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donald personally led dozens of guards to the estate to oversee the collection. Cleveland stood behind him with Rory by his side.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The air outside the fields was filled with the sweet aroma of melons. The lush green Verdant Crown Melons looked particularly enticing, and the fields were bustling with activity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Women used emerald shears to cut the melons. Men carried them with wooden poles or transported them in large wooden carts. Long lines had already formed at the collection point.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The estate's stewards and their assistants were busy weighing, inspecting, and recording the melons. After registration, the guards, along with hired workers, transported them to the church's warehouse through the Teleportation Plate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donald began his speech. "You've all worked hard. This year's harvest is good! The top three growers will each be rewarded with a Verdant Crown Melon. Those who fail to meet the standards will be reported to the Inspection Office and expelled from the church!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone worked even harder. Cleveland, pretending to be casual, raised his voice and asked Rory, "Where are the new ones?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rory immediately caught on and shouted, "Alexander! Logan! Time to hand in your melons!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>People looked around. "They're not here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cleveland let out a cold snort. "Did they run away? Hah! Even better. Now they've added another crime to their record. Not even the Head Priest Hezekiah can save them now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The morning passed, and all the workers had submitted their melons, except for Alexander and Logan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donald and Cleveland exchanged knowing smiles. "They must have fled," they thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll send the soldiers to search for them. Rory, go to Sheriff Darwin and report that two Risunese spies have infiltrated the Dominion Church. Have their portraits distributed and issue a wanted order. We'll capture them as soon as possible," Donald ordered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rory nodded and was about to leave when someone suddenly shouted, "They're here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It looks like them."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd started murmuring.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander and Logan were pushing a large wooden cart toward them. There was only one big wooden crate on it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They moved closer, and people noticed something strange. The cart left deep wheel marks on the hard-packed yellow soil.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander parked the cart, wiped his sweat, and glanced at Cleveland. "Mr. Wheeler, are you feeling unwell? You don't look so good."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You...!" Cleveland's chest rose and fell with fury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donald's eyes widened. "Did you forget today is the melon harvest?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smirked, lazily picking at his ear. "Of course, we remember."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then why are you pushing this broken cart here? The Head Priest Hezekiah values you, yet you failed to submit any melons? I have no choice but to punish you according to the rules!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment Donald finished speaking, Cleveland shouted, "Soldiers! Arrest them and report them to the Inspection Office!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rory sneered from the side. "Now it's your turn to suffer!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The onlookers whispered among themselves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander clasped his hands behind his back and gazed at the sky. Then he sighed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're celebrating too soon." He turned to Logan. "Give them the melons."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Got it!" Logan grinned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He opened the wooden crate on the cart and pointed inside. "The Verdant Crown Melons are right here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cleveland rushed forward and peered in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inside the one-meter-wide wooden crate sat two massive Verdant Crown Melons. Unlike the others, these had a translucent, emerald-green rind. Through the skin, one could faintly see the vibrant red flesh inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>These melons were enormous.</span></p><div class="pagination">
