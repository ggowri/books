What are you </span><span>guys </span><span>going to do?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander coldly looked at the executives of the Obsidian Gang, who were hiding in the corner.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They shivered, and their faces were livid.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were really scared</span><span>. B</span><span>ecause Chase, Gore, </span><span>and the number one fighter </span><span>Wayne</span><span> </span><span>of the Obsidian Gang, and a dozen confidants of Chase were all killed by Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Trenton, a bald, corpulent man,</span><span> suddenly knelt to </span><span>Ariella</span><span> and cried, </span><span>"Ms. Clarkson, congratulations on taking charge of the Obsidian Gang!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The other paused and secretly complained that he stole the thunder. Then, they exclaimed in unison, "Ms. Clarkson, congratulations on taking charge of the Obsidian Gang!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander nodded his head with satisfaction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ecstatic, Ariella glanced at him with gratitude and admiration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He smiled, "Ariella, the Obsidian Gang property has been returned to you. If anyone dares to disobey you in the future, </span><span>just </span><span>call me, and I will eliminate his family."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Trenton and the others suddenly trembled with fear and hurriedly promised to listen to Ariella.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, thank you, Alexander."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tears welled up in Ariella's eyes, and she couldn't help but cry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wiped away her tears, turned to glare at Trenton and the others, and warned, "You submitted yourselves to Chase and betrayed my father. I will never forget it! If you don't listen to me, </span><span>I'll wipe out </span><span>your family</span><span>!</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Trenton was so scared that a cold sweat broke out on his back, and the others all apologized to Ariella one by one.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ask someone to clean the place up and then go to the Riverside Hotel to wipe out th</span><span>ose</span><span> </span><span>assholes </span><span>of the Sakra Society!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If any of them escapes, I will kill you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Trenton immediately patted his chest and promised, "Don't worry, Ms. Clarkson. We will handle this little thing perfectly."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ariella snorted, "Go!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Trenton and the others hurried to get ready.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Whe</span><span>n</span><span> they left, Alexander secretly released a few threads of the Force, each lurking around them separately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If</span><span> they </span><span>dare to betray </span><span>Ariella</span><span> again</span><span>, he could make them suffer at any time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"O</span><span>w</span><span>!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, Ariella covered her forehead and lost her balance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosalia quickly supported her and said anxiously, "The poison</span><span> is hurting her</span><span>. What should we do?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander carefully examined Ariella with the Force Sense. Her condition was really not good, but it was still within his control.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He ordered, "Find a quiet room, and I'll </span><span>help to remove</span><span> her</span><span> poison</span><span>!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without hesitation, Rosalia hurriedly asked someone to lead the way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the bedroom, Ariella was already </span><span>dizzy</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She stammered, "Oh no! A-Am I dying? Alexander, </span><span>please </span><span>save me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander couldn't help laughing</span><span>. This young girl </span><span>was quite cute.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leaning back on the sofa, she narrowed her beautiful eyes, and her </span><span>big boobs were shaking</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay. I will save you right now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander </span><span>unbuttoned</span><span> Ariella's </span><span>clothes</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She stuttered sweetly, "Alexander, w-what are you doing? Why</span><span> are you </span><span>tak</span><span>ing</span><span> off my </span><span>clothes</span><span>? Do you like me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although her body was soft, she was still awake</span><span> and </span><span>made no resistance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, Ariella's shirt was unbuttoned, and her </span><span>attractive big boobs</span><span> came into Alexander</span><span>'s </span><span>view at once.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her </span><span>sexy</span><span> body was </span><span>also </span><span>exposed to Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She screamed, "Oh! Alexander, you are </span><span>so </span><span>bad</span><span>...</span><span>" Despite her attempt to stand up, she had no strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ariella became a</span><span> sweet cake</span><span> to Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This girl was so cute and sexy</span><span>, which </span><span>turned </span><span>Alexander</span><span> on. He was </span><span>like a blazing mountain fire in summer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But a black shadow crept on her body as if it were to spread all over her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was the result of Chase's chronic poison, a compound one. It should have been made of several types, so he had no antidote.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Alexander didn't have the Force to </span><span>remove</span><span> the chronic poison out of her body, Ariella would definitely be dead.</span></p><div class="pagination">
