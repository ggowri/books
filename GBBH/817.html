  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Sanchez covered his burning face, looking confused and saying, "Martin, why did you hit me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Damn you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Martin kicked Sanchez hard in the stomach.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Sanchez screamed and fell to the ground, shaking in pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then Martin turned around, bowed his head, and smiled flatteringly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He said to Alexander, "Mr. Hawthorne, he is ignorant and doesn't know you. I'll teach him a lesson!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Sanchez was stunned and stared at Alexander with a dull face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Martin cursed at him fiercely, "This is the leader of Ultimate Alliance. Sanchez, you are blind."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ah!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Sanchez was so frightened that he collapsed to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander looked at Martin with cold eyes and said, "Since you know me, then follow the rules and sort out your men.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If I see you bullying people on this street again, I will kill you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As soon as he finished speaking, Alexander stepped on Sanchez's right hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Suddenly, there was a crisp sound of bone cracking, and all the finger bones of Sanchez's right hand were shattered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ah! Spare me, please..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Sanchez wailed miserably for mercy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander ignored him until he broke his right hand, then he turned around and left with Ava.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne, please be careful on your way back. I will teach them a lesson!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Martin fawned on Alexander until Alexander was far away, then he turned around and looked at Sanchez and the others with a cold gaze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Break one hand of each of them and make them kneel here and apologize to everyone!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A group of people rushed forward, and suddenly, the streets were filled with painful wails and pleas for mercy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Those merchants who were charged protection fees were watching the fun. Seeing this scene, they were shocked and grateful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ava took Alexander to shop in the shopping mall for a while. Soon, Alexander was holding more than a dozen shopping bags, all of which were clothes and jewelry bought by Ava. She also carefully selected several sets of clothes for Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Wait a minute, I'll try on that dress."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ava took a fancy to a black hip skirt and walked into the fitting room with the skirt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander heard the rustling sounds of her taking off clothes in the fitting room. He couldn't help but activate his All-seeing Eyes and saw the scene in the fitting room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He saw that Ava had taken off all her clothes except for her sexy bra and thong.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The black thong was embedded in her crotch, and her plump buttocks trembled slightly as she tried on clothes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander couldn't help but swallow his saliva and became excited.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this time, Ava's plump butt was facing him. Alexander couldn't bear it anymore and flashed into the fitting room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ava suddenly heard a noise behind her and was about to turn around.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But a big hand covered her mouth, and she was so scared that she almost lost her soul.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander's voice rang in her ears, "Baby, don't be afraid, it's me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ava's face suddenly turned red, and her whole body felt numb.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She found that after a period of training by her mother, she not only did not become resistant to Alexander but became more and more sensitive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander's two hot, big hands were already pressing on her naked buttocks. He was kneading it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ah! We are in a fitting room. Will anyone find us?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ava was shy but also felt extremely excited.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander laughed and said, "I've locked the door, no one will notice us. Of course, if you shout too loudly, someone might notice."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ava was panicked. She knew how powerful Alexander was, and she would make a sound when they had sex.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And in such an exciting situation, she would probably scream even louder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ava begged, "Please don't do it here, okay? When we go back, you can do whatever you want..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander refused directly, "You have taken off your clothes and are in the right position, so why shouldn't I do it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He greedily caressed her plump thighs and buttocks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ava's posture indeed looked like she was waiting for a man to have sex with her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You are bad. I was trying on clothes, but you just wanted to have fun by doing it to me in a public place like this... You men just like to humiliate women like this, don't you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ava pouted, seemingly blaming him, but her body was very cooperative.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander opened the charming crack of her buttocks, buried his face in it, took a deep sniff, and showed an intoxicated expression. "It smells so good!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
