  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry, Boss. I'll get it done," Logan assured, taking the check from Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Fairfax family had been swindled out of 40 million, with 30 million already landing in the hands of the Godfather, known as "SATAN." It was certainly a lost cause to try and reclaim that money.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Besides, the Fairfax family didn't really deserve sympathy. With this last 10 million, they could still live above the average person's standard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, dreaming of any wealthy or elite social circles was out of the question.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's phone rang again, and he felt a surge of anger. It seemed the Fairfax family clung to him like a relentless specter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Surprisingly, it was a call from Lily this time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Over the past few days, Alexander had been busy preparing for the conference, crafting magic powders, and dealing with Sebastian, leaving him no time to visit Lily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He answered the call with a smile, but his expression quickly turned serious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was clear from Lily's hoarse voice that she'd been crying and was deeply upset, even despairing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rushing to the hospital, Alexander arrived just as a group of thugs, led by Nick, barged into Lily's room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily sat in a wheelchair, tears streaming as she berated her son, "You ungrateful brat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What do you think you're doing? If you try anything, I'll call the police!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nick retorted arrogantly, "You old hag, you think you can secretly give all the money to Alexander behind my back?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm here for the house today. Hand it over. I'm your son, your rightful heir.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Calling the cops won't help you. If I don't get it today, you'll just give it to Alexander later! Now sign over the house to me, and get out!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After being fired from the bank, Nick had set his sights on his mother's property, convinced that any money Alexander had must have come from Lily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I will never sign it over! Get out of here!" Lily shouted, her body trembling with anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nick, however, gestured harshly to the thugs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hold her down. Once she signs, the house is mine, and nobody can take it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily broke into sobs, frantically trying to break free.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her injured leg and age left her defenseless against the brutish men.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Nick, have you lost your mind? I'm your mother! When have I ever given Alexander money?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Since your father passed, this house is all we have. When I'm gone, it'll be yours. Why betray me like this?" Lily </span><span>cried,</span><span> her voice filled with anguish.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Quiet, you old witch! Stop trying to play the innocent!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander's nothing but a leech. Without you sneaking him money, he'd be nothing!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nick raged on, lifting his arm to strike Lily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop!" Alexander shouted, lunging forward to grab Nick's arm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You bastard, touch my aunt, and you'll regret it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nick let out a piercing scream, feeling his arm go numb.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, you dare strike me in front of my mom? See, mom, he's hitting me!" Nick yelled shamelessly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, I hit you. So what?" Alexander replied, slapping Nick again, leaving him seeing stars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily covered her face, unable to watch, tears flowing freely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing her so distraught broke Alexander's heart, and he shoved Nick aside with force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nick shouted at the men he brought, "What are you standing around for?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I hired you to fight, not to spectate!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get him, and don't hold back. I'll take the fall if something happens!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thugs surrounded Alexander, rolling up their sleeves, ready to take him down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily was terrified and immediately urged Alexander to run.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Alexander wasn't worried in the slightest. Instead, he charged straight at the group of men.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The first guy he hit went down hard with a single punch from Alexander. A few more kicks and punches later, the remaining thugs were wailing in pain, begging for mercy on the floor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nick was frozen in shock, stammering out, "Y... you... don't hit me. My mom's been good to you. You can't hit me..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His pathetic plea only fueled Alexander's anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander grabbed Nick by the collar, pulling him close.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now you're hiding behind your mom's name to save your skin? Nick, if it weren't for my aunt's sake, you'd be dead already!" Alexander snarled.</span></p><div class="pagination">
