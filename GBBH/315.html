  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before arriving, they thought having two powerful Shadow Warriors leading the way might give them an advantage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To their surprise, Alexander was even more formidable than they imagined. While the City of Sorcery couldn't confirm if Guzman had been killed by Alexander, it was highly likely that he was responsible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Guzman was a dark wizard and wielded the Ancestral Witch's Cane, on the verge of breaking through to become a powerful white wizard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>An older wizard awkwardly smiled and said, "Mr. Hawthorne, you jest. We come representing the City of Sorcery to request the return of the Ancestral Witch's Cane."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was taken aback but maintained his composure, replying, "What Ancestral Witch's Cane? I've never heard of it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The older wizard's smile vanished, replaced by a cold expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne, you may deceive others, but you can't fool us from the City of Sorcery. Guzman died at your hands, so you must have the Ancestral Witch's Cane.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you return the Ancestral Witch's Cane, we in the City of Sorcery would be willing to form an alliance with you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander laughed heartily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"An alliance sounds great, but... I truly haven't seen this Ancestral Witch's Cane. You might want to check elsewhere; I won't keep you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, don't be so arrogant!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A wizard beside him fumed but was stopped by the older wizard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Since Mr. Hawthorne hasn't seen the Ancestral Witch's Cane, we'll take our leave. I hope you act wisely."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he pulled his companion away, leaving without looking back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's icy gaze followed their retreating figures, a hint of murderous intent lurking beneath the surface.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The older wizard broke into a sweat and quickened his pace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander sensed more eyes lurking in the shadows, so he let them go.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although he had already offended the City of Sorcery, he couldn't afford to make them outright enemies just yet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He turned to Rosalia, who was lying on the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Boom!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thunder rumbled in the sky; a storm was approaching.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Flashes of lightning followed, accompanied by a deafening roar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Plop!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Raindrops began to pour down in torrents.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosalia stared at the blood-soaked body on the ground, fear filling her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The power of the person before her was terrifying. Even the top ten Shadow Warriors </span><span>from the Red Umbrella Group would be defeated in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smiled at her, his deep gaze seeming to pierce through her thoughts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Forcing down her fear, Rosalia asked, "What do you plan to do with me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander leisurely picked up a cigarette and lighter from the table, lit one, and exhaled a large smoke ring directly at her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosalia swallowed hard and said, "If you're going to kill me, please make it quick."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander replied nonchalantly, "You came to kill me but ended up being captured. Whether I kill you now is entirely up to me. If you surrender, I might let you go."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosalia clearly paused for a moment, then flashed a flirtatious smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>So</span><span> this guy is a lecher," she thought. "If that's the case, there's still hope."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She stood up and sensuously removed her fitted combat suit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her flawless, curvy body was fully exposed before Alexander, every enticing curve on display, and he couldn't help but notice her prominent breasts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne, as long as you don't kill me, you can do anything you want..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosalia licked her lips and beckoned to him, exuding an irresistible allure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander chuckled, seemingly unimpressed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosalia frowned, surprised. Wasn't he supposed to be a lecher? Why wasn't he taking the bait...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If only he became infatuated with her, she might have a chance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander sneered. Rosalia still hadn't entirely relinquished her resistance, but he was indifferent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nevertheless, this woman was indeed stunning, with an incredibly voluptuous figure that ignited his desires.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander beckoned her over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A triumphant smile flashed across Rosalia's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She swayed her hips and approached Alexander, kneeling before him, her large, watery eyes locked onto him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, a flash of cold steel glinted!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosalia had concealed a sharp little knife between her fingers, no bigger than half a finger, but it glinted ominously as it shot toward Alexander's throat.</span></p><div class="pagination">
