  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paxton's eyes were bloodshot, which was scary.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beverly's face turned pale. She was out of options.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She knew that the operation had failed and that the situation was very dangerous and that she had to escape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As long as Alexander came to her, she would be surrounded by the Axe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Paxton, let's go. He is too strong. He may rush in within a minute. We still have time to retreat now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beverly grabbed Paxton's arm and spoke anxiously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Retreat?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paxton glared at her with disdain and sneered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Where can we go? If we run, we will all be defeated, and the Axe will occupy the </span><span>Mandale</span><span> Town. Where else do you think we can go?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beverly said in a trembling voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even if they want to occupy </span><span>Mandale</span><span> Town, we still have the opportunity to escape to Goldford or go abroad. If we don't leave now, we will be dead..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paxton hesitated for a while.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay! Follow me. Let's leave </span><span>Mandale</span><span> Town!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In fact, Paxton knew that from the moment the six experts and Dereck died, they had already lost the battle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were still some people defending the headquarters. They could take shelter there temporarily and then gather manpower for a counterattack or withdraw from </span><span>Mandale</span><span> Town.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's go!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beverly was delighted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hurry up. Retreat. Let them hold on."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paxton agreed and then shouted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"For those who hold on to the end, I will reward you handsomely. Each of you will receive half a million dollars. I will keep my promise."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paxton retreated into the crowd with Beverly and a few of his henchmen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The wage of avarice was death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paxton announced a huge reward of half a million dollars per person, which immediately aroused the greed of many people.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were so overwhelmed by desire that they even launched a fierce counterattack towards Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were some smart people who, seeing Paxton start to retreat, realized that the situation was bad and immediately followed Paxton and ran outside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Some people even ran away faster than Paxton.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hurry up! Don't let them get away first. Or we'll be killed."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paxton stopped pretending and quickly pulled Beverly into the car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two leaders fled. And the coalition forces lost their fighting spirit. They would not get the bounty Paxton promised.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Chase him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stanley ordered his men to chase Paxton but was stopped by Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Clean up the scene and stabilize the situation. Paxton and Beverly can't get away. Leave it to me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Speaking, Alexander jumped into the car and chased after Paxton's convoy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn Paxton, you're in trouble for messing with Mr. Hawthorne."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Malone smiled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From now on, </span><span>Mandale</span><span> Town would be ruled by the Axe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lock up all captives, then seize all gem mines and warehouses. Let's go!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Axe was cheering.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop! Stop!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beverly kept reminding the driver that they had arrived at the Weaver House.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Several armored off-road vehicles suddenly braked and stopped in front of the gate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get out of the car!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beverly opened the car door and ran, looking back and screaming in fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paxton turned his head and saw a black car following behind him. And it seemed that it was about to catch up with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Quick! Pay attention. Kill the enemy!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beverly gave an order.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sentry at the gate of the Weaver House immediately took action, aiming heavy machine guns and rocket launchers at the black car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Great, kill Alexander! Fire!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paxton looked happy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Two heavy machine guns were placed in front of the Weaver House's door, using large-caliber ammunition with a maximum firing rate of up to three thousand rounds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And there </span><span>were</span><span> rocket launchers and a dozen guards armed with guns.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Two heavy machine guns fired wildly. The shell hit the black car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next second, the rockets were launched and hit the car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A loud bang!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The car exploded, with countless fragments and parts flying everywhere.</span></p><div class="pagination">
