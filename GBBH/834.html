  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Craig, don't believe a word he says. His sister-in-law is short, chubby, and has a terrible temper. She's not right for you. My sister, on the other hand, is gentle, beautiful, and a perfect match for you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Shut up! How dare you insult my sister-in-law!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'm just stating facts. How is that an insult?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They started shouting at each other and soon broke into a fight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Craig burst out laughing, cursing them in his head, "What a bunch of shallow, snobby idiots."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Back in the day, they'd called him names like "fat pig" or "big guy" and wouldn't even glance his way. Thanks to Alexander, he finally had his moment of revenge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Craig gave them a disdainful look and smugly announced.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Alexander has already arranged a job for me. Starting tomorrow, I'll be a supervisor at the Saint Group, earning five hundred thousand dollars a year."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A supervisor at the Saint Group with a five hundred thousand dollars annual salary!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The room fell silent. Everyone stared at Craig with envy and hatred, wishing they could strangle this annoying man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Craig glared back fiercely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What's with those looks? Not happy about it? If you're upset, I'll call Alexander right now and have him deal with you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone immediately felt deflated and quickly put on fake smiles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even though they were bleeding with jealousy inside, they had no choice but to reluctantly congratulate Craig.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A Ferrari was parked by the square. It was late at night, and the surroundings were eerily quiet, with hardly a soul in sight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander went to the restroom, planning to return to the car and comfort Alice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As he turned the corner, he suddenly heard two men talking on the other side of the plaza.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Hey, did you see that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Of course, I saw it. No doubt about it, it's Ms. Hollister."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander's heart skipped a beat. He thought, "Could it be the assassin?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He stopped in his tracks, his senses on high alert, and stealthily moved closer to eavesdrop on their conversation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The buzz-cut man continued.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Damn, Ms. Hollister's figure is insane. Absolutely top-tier! Every guy in our department fantasizes about being with her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The bespectacled man beside him licked his lips with a vulgar grin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Her breasts are so big. If I could have just one bite, I'd gladly become her son."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ha! Ms. Hollister wouldn't want a grown-up son like you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The buzz-cut man teased, laughing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander sighed silently, realizing he had overreacted. These were clearly employees from the Saint Group gossiping about Alice in the most indecent way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The bespectacled man chuckled. "Do you know what nickname we gave Ms. Hollister? We call her Breasts Goddess."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alice did have an enviable figure. Her full, perky breasts were hard to miss. But hearing her reduced to such a crude nickname made Alexander both angry and oddly flattered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Her breasts are absolutely perfect, so firm, so smooth..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The bespectacled man's lecherous tone grew increasingly explicit, almost drooling as he spoke.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The buzz-cut man scoffed. "Top-notch, so what? As if you've seen her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I have seen it, believe it or not," the bespectacled man retorted confidently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander thought, "What?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander frowned deeply. He couldn't bear the thought of Alice being involved with anyone else behind his back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Stop bragging." The buzz-cut man sneered. "Maybe you saw it in your dreams. There's no way you'd ever get that lucky."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The bespectacled man countered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I swear it's true! Just the other day, Ms. Hollister was wearing a low-cut top while sitting on the couch reviewing some documents.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I happened to walk by and glanced down her neckline. Oh my God! She wasn't wearing a bra, just a pair of little nipple covers. It was incredible!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Her skin was so smooth, and her big breasts stood firm like two small hills! The cleavage was so deep it seemed endless. I even saw a tiny mole on her chest. So sexy, I almost fainted from happiness."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander clenched his jaw and muttered a curse. He would definitely fire the bespectacled man when he got back. He was too lewd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Still, this wasn't Alice's fault. It was an accident.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even though their words were disgusting, Alexander felt a strange tension in his body. A part of him couldn't deny a surge of pride.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "She's their untouchable goddess, but she willingly kneels at my feet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They can only sneak glances while I get to hold her, touch her, and have her completely."</span></p><div class="pagination">
