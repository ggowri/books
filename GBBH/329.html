Brittany, did you see that? This isn't helping me; he's being a pervert."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Madison shouted angrily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brittany replied with displeasure, "Mr. Hawthorne, I asked you to help my friend, not to grope her!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander rolled his eyes. "Isn't she better now? Truly blind to the obvious, I have no common language with you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Huh! Really?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brittany hadn't noticed that Madison was no longer in pain, too focused on wanting to get back at Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madison, are you really not in pain anymore?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I... I really don't feel pain anymore. This must not be his doing; I probably wasn't sick to begin with, it was just a coincidence."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You just touched me; you must apologize!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Madison glared at Alexander indignantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander couldn't be bothered with her and directly opened the car door to sit inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brittany quickly stopped Madison.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Forget it, bear with it. I don't think it's just a coincidence; after all, he's someone my grandfather invited, he must have real skills."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Madison laughed dismissively.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Brittany, you're too naive; today's con artists are very clever, their tricks are sophisticated."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brittany ignored her, commanding the driver to rush back as quickly as possible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the observation room set up by the Thompson family for several tens of millions of dollars, a boy around fifteen or sixteen lay in bed with his eyes tightly closed, his complexion pale, connected to various advanced medical devices.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quentin stood beside several doctors in white coats, at a loss for what to do.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was also a bald man in a gray robe, with a very serious expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From their heavy expressions, it was clear that Quentin's grandson, Scott, was in a very dire situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Grandpa, how's Scott doing now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brittany entered the room and immediately asked about her brother's condition, her beautiful eyes filled with tears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Quentin could speak, the gray-robed bald man said, "Ms. Thompson, you don't have to worry; I've invited a black-robed Master who will arrive in </span><span>Tijuanea</span><span> in a few days."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quentin coldly replied, "A few days? We don't even know if my grandson can last that </span><span>long."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The bald man immediately showed an awkward expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne, please take a look at my grandson."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quentin looked at Alexander with full of expectation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under Quentin's and Brittany's eager gazes, Alexander approached the bedside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Using his Force Sense, Alexander discovered a strange black energy coalescing in Scott's head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, that black energy was writhing incessantly as if it were alive, leaving Alexander astounded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was the result of witchcraft insects; witchcraft insects were one of the most vicious forms of sorcery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once the body was invaded by witchcraft insects, they typically settled in the brain to reproduce, and when they reached a certain number, they destroyed the host's body until death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Scott's internal witchcraft insects were even more peculiar; they were a kind of creature between physical and energy form.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not to mention with today's medical conditions, even ordinary wizards wouldn't be able to detect it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander looked coldly at the bald man in the gray robe, wondering if this guy was simply lacking the strength to detect the witchcraft insects or if he was behind the trickery himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne, what do you think?" Brittany asked urgently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Alexander could speak, the bald man jumped in, saying, "Ms. Thompson, don't worry. When the Master I invited arrives, he will definitely solve this problem. Don't let some frauds fool you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, he glared at Alexander fiercely.</span></p><div class="pagination">
