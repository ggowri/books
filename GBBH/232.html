  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's palm moved with lightning speed, slicing through the air with a sharp whistling sound. He gauged John's strength to be on par with Joseph, </span><span>Houtte</span><span>, and others&mdash;strong but not extraordinary. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, among ordinary people, John was a top-tier fighter, capable of handling a dozen opponents with ease.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Butler, I'd be delighted!" Alexander replied, meeting John's strike with his own palm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their hands clashed with force. Alexander intentionally matched John's strength, resulting in both of them stepping back simultaneously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>John looked thrilled. "Impressive! Not only can he hypnotize, but he's also quite skilled in combat!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're too kind, Mr. Butler. I'm just a young guy showing off a bit in front of a true expert," Alexander replied with a modest smile, waving his hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, as he did so, his fingers moved with incredible dexterity, like a snake, creating a blur of afterimages. This was a special Force Control technique designed to disorient and eventually control the observer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Robert felt a wave of dizziness, his mind going blank. John, the direct target, stumbled back, his vision spinning. Sensing danger, he bit his tongue, the sharp pain snapping him back to reality.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander stopped using Force Control and simply stood there, smiling. John paled, realizing how close he had come to defeat. If Alexander had pressed the attack during the hypnosis, John would have been in serious trouble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Milton, wake up!" John shouted, sending an invisible force that jolted Robert back to his senses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smiled, "That was impressive, Mr. Butler. Is that the legendary inner power?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Robert, still reeling from John's shout, forced himself to look admiring and grateful. "Mr. Butler's skills just keep getting sharper with age!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>John's mood improved. He said, "Mr. Hawthorne, I didn't expect someone so young to have such profound hypnotic and fighting skills. The position of security director at our trading center is yours!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Determined not to lose Alexander to another, John added, "Don't worry. Young talents like you are exactly what the Brilliant Group needs. I'll recommend you to our chairman, Mr. Bryant, for a promotion!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Our chairman values talent even more than I do. You'll have a bright future, just don't forget me," John said, patting Alexander on the shoulder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Outwardly, Alexander appeared grateful and humble, but inside, he was calculating. John, as the general manager, was close to Guzman and might know his whereabouts. If not for the surveillance cameras, Alexander might have acted already.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"By the way, Mr. Butler, could I get a 10% discount on my purchases? I just bought a potential potion&mdash;any chance of a discount there?" Alexander asked with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Absolutely, I'll arrange a $100 million refund right away. You certainly know how to spend! But be cautious with that potential potion. It has serious side effects, even for someone as fit as you," John advised, genuinely concerned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander replied, "Thanks for the warning. I bought it for research purposes. Who knows what I might discover?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>John's expression turned curious. "I heard you bought all our meteorites too. I thought it was just a rumor, but it seems you really are into research!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
