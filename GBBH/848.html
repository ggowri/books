  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander felt like he was submerged in honey, an electric shiver running through his body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>There was no denying that Norma was a mature and voluptuous beauty, exuding a sensual allure that provoked a man's primal desires.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She was seductive to the core!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Alexander could see the sharp, cunning glint hidden in Norma's eyes, fleeting but unmistakable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This woman was no simple beauty; she knew how to charm and manipulate men, and she was smart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Most men wouldn't stand a chance against her; they'd be enchanted to the point of losing their heads, yet never even make it to her bed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander deliberately put on an eager expression, staring at her full chest and swallowing hard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Norma, your casino is truly impressive, world-class."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Hehe... Alexander, I didn't expect you to be even more handsome than in your photos. I thought the pictures were edited, but they don't do you justice," Norma said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Suddenly, Norma walked over and naturally looped her arm through Alexander's, holding him tightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her ample chest brushed against him, her body teasingly close yet not quite touching.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Heat surged through Alexander; Norma knew how to seduce a man, even better than Reina and Violet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander calmly pulled his arm away. "Norma, you didn't invite me just to cozy up, did you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Hehe, don't rush. Let me show you around first," she said, pressing her finger lightly against Alexander's lips, her eyes full of charm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Norma's finger touched Alexander's lips as she gazed at him with a flirtatious smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The teasing continued, and Alexander felt a wave of heat through his body, a faint blush appearing on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Norma noticed Alexander's rising body heat and the reaction in his stance, concluding confidently that no man could resist her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She was determined to control Alexander, deal with Sean first, and seize control of the whole family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, she'd confront the Sakra Society and become the most powerful figure in the Risun.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Norma was relentless, determined to have Alexander wrapped around her finger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Alexander, you've come all this way. I need to show you around, let you enjoy yourself and relax. As for the alliance, even I'm not in a hurry, so why should you be?" Norma said with a playful pout, pulling him through the casino.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Norma playfully scolded him while leading Alexander around the gaming floor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Hehe, what do you think of those dealers? Young, beautiful, with amazing figures. Should I arrange one or two for you? Or maybe all of them to keep you company..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing this, Alexander's lips curled into a sly smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Not bad, they're gorgeous with great figures. But none compared to you, Norma..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander put on a deliberately greedy look, staring at Norma's deep cleavage and swallowing hard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Norma felt even more confident; she was sure she could use Alexander to deal with Sean.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Oh, Alexander, you really know how to talk!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She quickly looped her arm through his again, making them look like a couple in love as they strolled through the casino.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Norma meticulously explained the rules of the casino to him, never tiring.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marvin followed from a distance, watching the closeness between Alexander and Norma with a mix of surprise and admiration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"No wonder he's not afraid of the Dragon Gang!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In truth, Alexander wasn't as relaxed as he appeared. Having such a stunning woman pressed against him naturally evoked a man's usual reactions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Alexander didn't let himself get lost in it; he kept up an act, pretending to be easily swayed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Since Norma wanted to play this game, Alexander was more than willing to play along. He figured there was no harm in it for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander even playfully pressed his elbow into her chest, brushing it lightly a few times. It felt soft and inviting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Norma was annoyed; she only wanted to control Alexander, not actually be taken advantage of.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But she didn't dare react; after all, she had approached him first and hadn't yet secured Alexander's allegiance.</span></p><div class="pagination">
