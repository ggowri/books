  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He picked up Rosalia and made her kneel on the bed with her plump buttocks raised high.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Without Alexander's instructions, Charlize understood Alexander's thoughts and knelt obediently with Rosalia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The buttocks of two women were side by side in front of Alexander's eyes, shaking coquettishly, enticing him to enter one of them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander didn't favor anyone in particular but held their buttocks and played with them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Every time, he lasted a minute or two, and then he switched people to continue playing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The two beauties were going crazy, and their moans never stopped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After continuing for half an hour, Rosalia and Charlize could no longer hold on. They felt limp and weak and were so excited that their consciousness was blurred. They were only relying on their willpower to stay on their knees.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander finally reached his limit. When he exploded, Rosalia and Charlize seemed to be activated. They quickly knelt between Alexander's legs and opened their lips greedily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing such an exciting scene, Alexander could no longer control himself. He released himself violently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He left his semen on their faces, lips, and chests.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They licked him greedily. Alexander's heart was filled with a sense of conquest. He felt that he was enjoying the ultimate happiness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In an expansive estate in the eastern suburbs of Loscity, Gavin was meeting with Oliver.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The two sat in the yard filled with the fragrance of flowers. And Oliver carefully made coffee for Gavin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Knowing that Gavin had come to Loscity, Oliver rushed over as soon as possible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Oliver used to be a soldier. When the war broke out between the Eagle Empire and Avalora, Oliver was only in his twenties and was captured by Gavin's subordinates.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If Gavin hadn't shown leniency, Oliver wouldn't have been able to return to Loscity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Therefore, when Oliver learned that Gavin had come to Loscity, he hurried over to meet him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As the second-rate person of Avalora, Gavin had deep connections in the Eagle Empire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He was a senior member of the Ghost. Most of the country's top brass have joined the Ghost.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Therefore, Oliver wanted to please Gavin. If Gavin said a few good words in front of big shots, Oliver might get a promotion and a raise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gavin had helped Oliver stand out from the fierce competition and take the position of Chief of the Loscity Police Department.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Oliver was grateful to Gavin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>These high-grade coffee beans were imported from Avalora. Oliver was very skilled at making coffee. He had obviously studied it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The smell of coffee filled the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gavin smiled and said, "Oliver, you're getting more capable."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Oliver quickly flattered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Gavin Lawson, I'm glad to see you in good health."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gavin laughed vigorously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He said, "I made the right decision to come to Loscity. I am so lucky that I not only negotiated the magic powder business but also met Alexander, who has excellent medical skills. I can live a few more years!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Really? So you came here for the magic powder? Is Alexander willing to give up such a huge profit?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Oliver also became interested.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Well..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gavin smiled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He said, "I had heard of Alexander before I came here, but I didn't expect that he is generous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Not only did we agree on a partnership, but he would heal my injuries.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"But you're about to get into trouble!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gavin suddenly changed the subject, which scared Oliver.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Oliver asked cautiously, "Mr. Gavin Lawson, have I offended anyone? Please help me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gavin said, "Don't worry. You haven't had any bad luck yet, have you? I mean you're about to be in trouble."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gavin intentionally kept Oliver in suspense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Oliver knelt directly in front of Gavin and begged.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Gavin Lawson, please help me. If you hadn't saved me, I would have died on the battlefield.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I have been very respectful to you for so many years. If something bad happens to me, I might die. Please!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
