I'm going to be the next Vice President of the Brilliant Group!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why not?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Betty struck her again with the back of her hand, sending Jane reeling in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop it!" Sebastian bellowed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Betty, if you're claiming Mr. Gellar is a fraud, then show us the real master."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, let's see who you think you're bringing in..." Andrew taunted, refusing to believe his forty million dollars had been swindled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shut up!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian kicked Andrew to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Betty smirked, then turned to Alexander with a respectful bow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne, as the true creator of magic powder, it's time </span><span>for </span><span>you</span><span> to</span><span> clear this up."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone gawked at Alexander in stunned silence, eyes wide with disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The room buzzed with shocked whispers as the realization set in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian glared at Betty, rage flashing in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's the meaning of this? I told you to bring out the real creator, not put on some act with Alexander."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Betty responded calmly, "Billy and I get our magic powder directly from Mr. Hawthorne. </span><span>I</span><span>f he isn't the one who created it, then who is?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian sputtered, unable to counter her words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane pressed her hands to her head, feeling dizzy as everything she'd ignored now became painfully clear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Deep down, she knew Betty was telling the truth. Jackson's disappearance only confirmed it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The magic powder had taken the market by storm. She now realized that Alexander would soon control unimaginable wealth, not to mention the status and power that came with it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She'd destroyed her own future by forcing Alexander into divorce.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Regret gnawed at her, filling her with a searing pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This can't be true! I don't believe it...Mr. Gellar was supposed to be...there's no way Alexander could be...the forty million dollars..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Andrew's face turned ashen as he collapsed to the floor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every eye in the room locked on Alexander, filled with astonishment, envy, and a fierce, simmering greed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava and the Saint Group were equally dumbstruck, struggling to process what had just unfolded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander waved his hand. "Bring </span><span>it in</span><span>!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At his command, a small truck sped up, pulling to a stop in front of the crowd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Augusta and Marvin jumped out and opened the truck's rear doors, revealing stacks upon stacks of blue powder-filled bags.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander reached into one, grabbing a handful of the blue powder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the sunlight, the powder sparkled with a mesmerizing blue shimmer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A voice in the crowd gasped, "It's magic powder! An entire truckload of it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd buzzed with excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The guests were all devoted fans of magic powder. Most had only ever seen tiny bags of it, barely enough to fill a palm. Now, there was a truckload right in front of them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every eye was fixed on the truck, ablaze with raw greed and desire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The magic powder was in high demand, and the supply was limited.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the black market, a few grams could sell for thousands of dollars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A whole truckload? This could easily be worth two or three billion dollars, if not more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Some people inched closer to the truck, unable to hide their greedy fascination.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A few even cast glances at Alexander, plotting to seize the magic powder formula for themselves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, a series of dull thuds rang out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those who had dared to move felt the ground at their feet erupt with splinters of rock, leaving deep pits on the hard floor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They realized at once that there were snipers nearby.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A cold sweat broke out on their foreheads as they quickly retreated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd, previously buzzing with barely contained excitement, now quieted down, cowed by the sight of Alexander's prepared snipers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>William, Logan, and Charlize were positioned to the east, west, and south, their rifles trained on the crowd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were ready to take down anyone reckless enough to test them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander strolled over to Ava, took her hand, and led her to the truckload of magic powder. Ignoring the envious, bitter gazes of those around him, he raised his voice and declared, "The exclusive rights to magic powder belong to... the Saint Group!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His powerful words echoed through the room, silencing every murmur.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian's face turned deathly pale. He had never expected the situation to turn around so swiftly or so completely.</span></p><div class="pagination">
