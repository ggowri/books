  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Behind him stood a young man, towering over six and a half feet tall, incredibly obese, his body layered with rolls of fat. His hair was tied in a high topknot, and he wore nothing but a pair of blue-and-white striped shorts around his waist. His bare feet stomped over the rocky ground without a hint of discomfort.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Behind them stood over a thousand armed men, carrying blades and rifles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When they arrived at&nbsp;Tiger Gang, they found the gates wide open, completely deserted. The fat&nbsp;Risunese&nbsp;man grinned at the middle-aged man beside him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Klein, looks like&nbsp;Josh&nbsp;is gone. I bet everyone in this Gang has already fled!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The tall, thin middle-aged&nbsp;Risunese&nbsp;man patted the fat man's arm with smug satisfaction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Adonis, looks like we've secured another Gang. The&nbsp;Sacred Spirit Gangordered us to take control of all the bandit dens in the&nbsp;Oxhead Mountains. At this rate, it won't take long!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two flattered each other as they stepped into&nbsp;Tiger Gang, leading a small group of men inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a thunderous&nbsp;boom, a massive wooden gate suddenly crashed down from above, sealing off the entrance completely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A lean but imposing figure stood defiantly atop the Gang walls, his fierce gaze locked on them. Holding a massive&nbsp;nine-ring broadsword, his entire body radiated an aura of raw ferocity. It was none other than&nbsp;Josh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, a battle cry erupted!&nbsp;Logan&nbsp;and&nbsp;Ivan, leading hundreds of armed fighters, charged out from the inner courtyard. Some surrounded the&nbsp;Sacred Spirit Gang&nbsp;fighters trapped inside, while others rushed up to defend the walls.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The&nbsp;Sacred Spirit Gang's&nbsp;men were thrown into chaos&mdash;those inside were surrounded, while those outside couldn't break through. No one knew if their two leaders were alive or dead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment,&nbsp;Adonis&nbsp;let out a loud, boisterous laugh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hahaha! I never thought an old, sick tiger like you still had tricks up your sleeve!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dressed in a pink robe,&nbsp;Klein&nbsp;sneered wickedly as he pointed at&nbsp;Josh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kneel and pledge loyalty to us now, and we might let the past slide!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clap, clap, clap!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, the sound of slow, deliberate applause echoed.&nbsp;Alexander emerged from the main hall, clapping as he strolled forward with a smirk.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A pink beanpole and a sumo wrestler&mdash;what a pair of&nbsp;Risunese&nbsp;clowns."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hmm? Another one?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Klein's&nbsp;sharp, angled eyebrows twitched. His beady eyes gleamed with malice as he locked onto Alexander and murmured,</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Adonis, take care of the old tiger. Be careful with this one&mdash;his energy is powerful!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adonis'&nbsp;fat cheeks trembled. He shot&nbsp;Josh&nbsp;a sideways glance and let out a low grunt. Then, his thick legs&mdash;each as wide as a grown man's waist&mdash;stomped the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Boom!&nbsp;The ground trembled beneath him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His massive body defied gravity, launching into the air like a crossbow bolt&mdash;his round head like an arrowhead, his bulky body the shaft, and his limbs the fletching&mdash;as he hurtled toward&nbsp;Josh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Josh&nbsp;roared, his&nbsp;nine-ring broadsword&nbsp;surging with blazing red&nbsp;protective energy, and swung down with all his might toward&nbsp;Adonis'&nbsp;head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two clashed instantly, matching each other blow for blow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inside the Gang, the battle erupted between both sides, while outside, the&nbsp;Sacred Spirit Gang's&nbsp;forces launched their assault.&nbsp;Logan&nbsp;and&nbsp;Ivan&nbsp;led their men in a fierce defense, holding the walls without retreating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Klein's&nbsp;beady eyes flashed with a vicious gleam. With a light tap of his toes, he glided toward&nbsp;Alexander, moving as effortlessly as a dragonfly skimming the water.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's eyes gleamed sharply. With a swift&nbsp;yoga twist, he instantly shifted to&nbsp;Klein's&nbsp;side, lowering his stance. His leg, as straight as a staff, carried the faint roar of thunder as he swept it toward&nbsp;Klein's&nbsp;ankle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Klein's&nbsp;eyes flickered with brief disdain. He tapped his toes against the ground and leaped into the air, letting out a sharp cry. "Levitating Technique!" A strange and mysterious energy spread around him. Though his movements seemed slow, he soared into the sky at an astonishing speed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Klein's&nbsp;energy was incredibly strong! At the very least, he was at the peak of a&nbsp;level-four warrior.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Levitating Technique!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's mind raced. His body shone with a vibrant blue&nbsp;protective energy, his eyes glowing with intensity as he locked onto&nbsp;Klein. He clenched his fists lightly, positioning one in front and one behind, lowering his stance into a solid guard with his feet firmly planted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Klein&nbsp;smirked coldly. Raising his index and middle fingers to his temples, he suddenly let out a fierce roar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Solar Fist!" In an instant, an intense white flash, brighter than the sun, blasted straight at Alexander. His eyes, fixed on&nbsp;Klein, were instantly overwhelmed by blinding light. The next moment, his vision turned completely white&mdash;then total darkness. He couldn't see a thing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment,&nbsp;Klein&nbsp;channeled his energy into his fingertip. With a sudden thrust, a brilliant white beam shot from his finger like a laser, hurtling straight for Alexander's chest!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Damn it! If he has the Levitating Technique, then of course he has the Solar Fist! And probably the Piercing Wave too!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was temporarily blinded, frustration boiling inside him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the blink of an eye, he could sense an overwhelmingly powerful energy surging right toward his chest!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander let out a low snort. Crossing his palms in front of his chest, he traced a circular motion. His&nbsp;protective energy&nbsp;flared up violently. With a powerful shove, he unleashed&nbsp;Seismic Cleave&mdash;a move from the&nbsp;Muscle-Tendon Classic. A dense surge of deep blue energy erupted in thick, cascading waves, crashing toward&nbsp;Klein&nbsp;like an inverted galaxy!</span></p><div class="pagination">
