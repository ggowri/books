You look a bit low on energy."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Alexander arrived at Alice's door, a playful, bell-like laugh greeted him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alice had already spotted Alexander from her security camera.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why are you here? Ava asked if I knew the chairman. Did you let something slip?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander sat down on the couch, looking a bit displeased.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alice was dressed casually at home, wearing a low-cut camisole dress that revealed a captivating scent and the alluring rise and fall of her fair curves at the neckline.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah! You misunderstood, Alexander. I didn't give anything away. I just said the chairman was interested in learning about the magic powder..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alice teased him, glancing down at his lower abdomen, and couldn't resist giving the visible excitement a quick squeeze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, did you come here because you were missing a woman?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander gave an awkward smile; he couldn't deny that was partly true.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After being intimate, he could quickly absorb James' Force, and the sensation it brought was even more intense than usual pleasures.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alice gently stroked Alexander's chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, you must've been with Ava. Now you're all fired up again. You're really something!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unable to resist, Alexander pulled her into his arms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her full curves rose and fell with her breathing, as enticing as could be.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Noticing Alexander's gaze, Alice let out a soft, playful hum.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander slipped his hand inside her dress, channeling his Force as he gently kneaded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alice closed her eyes shyly, her voice barely a whisper, "It tickles a bit... softer, please... and it kind of hurts..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Alexander continued, he offered a suggestion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your cycle just ended, didn't it? Let me treat it. You won't have any pain for at least six months."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh? Alexander, you're amazing! You can even tell that? Go ahead, please."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alice's face reddened, but she didn't hesitate at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, you don't need to beat around the bush if you want to sleep with me. I'm all for it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is for your health. Besides, you're my woman, so of course it's right to be with you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's assured tone made Alice feel delighted inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then I'll allow the treatment, but no sleeping with me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alice put on a defiant tone as she removed her camisole dress, revealing a pink lace bra and a sexy thong.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't Alexander's first time seeing her ample curves, but the sight still made his pulse race, his excitement growing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wow, you're wearing such sexy lingerie today."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander reached out and touched it, feeling the smooth, beautiful softness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmph, I knew you came here to sleep with me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alice teased him, though inside, she was more than willing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She confidently removed her bra and thong, tossing them onto the sofa, her flawless figure leaving Alexander breathless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, weren't you going to help with my cramps?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alice pouted and urged him softly, striking a seductive pose.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander channeled the Force into his hands, massaging her lower abdomen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, your hands are so warm... it feels wonderful."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alice relaxed, letting Alexander continue to massage her sensitive spots.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With each movement, Alice felt warmth spread through her body as if she were floating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, you're really good at this..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alice couldn't help but let out a soft moan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A soothing, warm energy moved over her, gentle and relaxing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a barely audible whisper, she said, "Alexander, don't men love to dominate women? It gives them a sense of conquest, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander pretended not to hear, continuing to massage her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alice's sensations intensified, like electric sparks running through her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She could hardly withstand the sensation, her eyes watery, her cheeks flushing deeply, her quickened breaths causing her curves to quiver nonstop.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, you've become so strong. Being with you is such happiness."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander had been barely holding back, but with Alice's teasing, he immediately leaned in to kiss her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alice clung to Alexander like an octopus, entangling with him passionately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When a woman is bold, she's often more uninhibited than a man, and the room is filled with their passionate energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, hurry..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alice urged him, unable to wait any longer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander moved in directly...</span></p><div class="pagination">
