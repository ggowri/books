  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Arlene couldn't help but say to Skyla, "Auntie, Alexander is too arrogant. You must not let him die peacefully."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Arlene spoke, her beautiful eyes sparkled, and her charming smile was very captivating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Arlene was stunningly beautiful, she was also cunning and ruthless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Skyla chuckled sinisterly, "Don't worry. He has already fallen into my trap. Not only will I take his life, but I will also make him hand over all his property and the formula for magic powder. Only then can I vent my hatred."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That would be the best, but it's a pity, he's quite good-looking..." Arlene shook her head at Alexander as if she felt quite regretful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Skyla walked towards Alexander, and the two locked eyes, ready to begin the duel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava was so nervous that her whole body trembled, but she knew she couldn't stop it, so she could only silently pray for Alexander in her heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's begin. Ladies first," Alexander said with a very calm expression, his tone more like an order to Skyla.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmph. You'll suffer soon enough. I'll make you suffer a fate worse than death to avenge my son," Skyla cursed, taking out a small black vial from her pocket, confidently saying, "This is my carefully concocted Gut-breaking Powder. Dare you to eat it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Cut the chatter! Give it to me." Alexander took the small vial, opened the lid, and poured all its contents into his mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one saw that when the poison entered his mouth, an invisible force wrapped around the poison.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if Alexander swallowed these poisons, the Force would isolate the poison from his body, preventing any harm to Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No. You can't eat that..." Ava wanted to shout, but she was so weak that she didn't even have the strength to speak loudly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Alexander swallow the entire vial of Gut-breaking Powder, Skyla laughed triumphantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hahaha. Alexander, you're doomed. Just less than a gram of this poison can kill several wild oxen."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This vial must contain over a hundred grams. Just wait for the poison to take effect."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Skyla confidently threatened Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you don't want to die, submit to me and hand over all your property. I'll count to ten, and you'll start feeling the effects."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"One, two, three, four, five..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Skyla finished counting ten, Alexander showed no reaction, and the playful smile on his face seemed to mock Skyla.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The discussions&nbsp;quieted down, and everyone stared at Alexander in astonishment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone thought, "Skyla made such a big deal about Gut-breaking Powder, but Alexander ate a whole vial, and he's completely fine?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Skyla was dumbfounded, not knowing how this could be.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You... How can you be fine? Don't you feel excruciating pain in your intestines, like being cut by a knife?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Skyla herself, if she accidentally ingested Gut-breaking Powder without a timely antidote, would suffer from a perforated stomach and die.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander chuckled coldly and said, "Nonsense. Now, it's your turn to eat the poison I prepared."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Skyla's face changed, and she suddenly reneged, "No, you must have cheated earlier. You have to eat it again."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The scene erupted into an uproar, with most people thinking Skyla was shameless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had all seen Alexander eat a whole vial of poison.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Augusta was furious, "Bitch. You're actually cheating. I'll kill you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Augusta was about to charge at Skyla but was stopped by Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, I agree. Bring out any other powerful poisons you have, and I'll taste them all," Alexander said calmly, which infuriated Augusta and the members of the Ultimate Alliance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sir, you can't do this."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That bitch dares to renege. Let's kill her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd was in an uproar, shouting and preparing to attack the Vanderbilt family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Quiet," Alexander said softly, and it seemed to carry infinite authority, immediately silencing everyone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Skyla, bring out all the witch poisons you're proud of."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's sharp gaze was like a blade, making Skyla sweat profusely, and she felt a great insult.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't get cocky, kid. You must have cheated earlier. I definitely can't poison you. If you have the guts, eat this Multipoison Pill." Skyla took out a green pill.</span></p><div class="pagination">
