  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After greeting the others, Ben led Alexander and Logan straight to the largest of the three hardwood tables in the center of the hall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On each of the three tables sat a bronze plaque, engraved with the words: [The Residency Office], [The Finance Office], and [The Inspection Office].</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Behind the Residency Office plaque stood an elderly man in his sixties or seventies, dressed in a simple blue robe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ben gestured toward Alexander and Logan. "Nathan, the Head Priest Hezekiah has instructed that these two be registered as laborers."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A flicker of surprise crossed Nathan Cavill's eyes before he quickly bowed. "Understood."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ben nodded, then turned to Alexander and Logan with a polite gesture.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Gentlemen, I'll take my leave."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander hurriedly returned the bow. "Thank you! I'll treat you to a meal next time we meet."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And me too!" Logan added quickly, afraid of being left out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ben and Nathan both looked slightly uncomfortable. Without another word, Ben turned and strode out of the hall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nathan turned back to the two young men. "What are your names? And where are you from?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's mind spun. He mimicked Ben's earlier movements and gave a respectful bow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Nathan, my name is Alexander, and this is my younger brother, Logan. We were kidnapped as children and only recently managed to escape. We don't know where we're originally from."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nathan let out a sigh. "What a tragedy. Those criminals deserve the worst."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He picked up a brush and recorded their names in the registry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Verdant Crown Melon Fields are short on workers right now. You two will help out there."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He turned to a young servant beside him. "Jedidiah, take them to collect their supplies."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A young man stepped forward and beckoned them to follow him deeper into the estate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not long after, the three of them arrived at a massive storage room lined with dozens of large chests.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jedidiah Jensen, the young man, opened one of the chests and retrieved two bronze badges and two small booklets.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"These badges are your laborer identification. Keep them on you at all times, or people might mistake you for thieves. And these booklets... outsiders would kill to get their hands on them. Now, let's find you a place to stay."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jedidiah led them through a maze of corridors before stopping in front of a large building. A brass plaque above the entrance read: [Teleportation Plate].</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inside, at the very center of the room, lay a massive golden circular plate, a few yards in diameter. It was covered in intricate engravings, glowing faintly, with gemstones embedded along its edge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Alexander and Logan stepped onto the plate with Jedidiah, a brilliant golden light erupted from beneath their feet. The bronze badges in their hands shimmered with a soft, multicolored glow, forming a protective barrier around them. In the blink of an eye, the plate spun beneath them, and their figures vanished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A wave of dizziness washed over them. When their vision cleared, they found themselves standing outside a manor, just beyond the church grounds. A wooden sign beside the entrance read: [Emerald Manor].</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This Teleportation Plate is incredible! All we had to do was think of our destination, and here we are," Logan marveled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The manor was vast, with hundreds, if not thousands, of stone houses spread across neatly paved courtyards. The ground was laid with large blue stone slabs, giving the whole place a well-structured and imposing look.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Each house accommodates two people," Jedidiah explained. "After you drip a drop of blood onto your badge, find an unoccupied stone house and claim it as your own. I'll be on my way now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hesitated for a moment before adding a final warning. "Dominion Church is enormous, and the people here are kind. They don't want us to waste time on long commutes, which is why they built the Teleportation Plate and infused it with divine power. But it only works within a 30-mile radius, and you must have your badge to use it. Don't go wandering where you shouldn't."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he entered a black stone house near the manor's entrance. A moment later, a flash of golden light signaled his departure, likely back to the Management Center.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This Teleportation Plate is basically spatial teleportation!" Logan muttered. "And we need to use our blood to activate these badges? That's a bit creepy."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander and Logan exchanged a glance before breaking into grins. For the first time, they had a moment to properly examine the badges and booklets. The torchlight from the manor cast a warm glow over their hands as they inspected them closely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two bronze badges were identical in size, about a finger's length and half a finger's width. On the front was an engraving of a grand, towering church, while the back bore a set of numbers. Alexander's badge read 10249. Logan's read 10250.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"These numbers are pretty high," Logan remarked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They then turned their attention to the neatly bound, pale-yellow booklets. Bold characters on the cover read: [Arhat Fist].</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their hearts pounded with excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander playfully threw a punch at Logan. "Time to test my martial arts!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Logan leaped back with a dramatic shout. "Watch out for my counterattack!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The two of them sparred like children, laughing as they tested their strength. Once their energy settled, they turned their focus back to finding a place to stay. Some of the stone houses had numbers carved above the doors, while others were blank. They quickly deduced that the unmarked ones were unoccupied.</span></p><div class="pagination">
