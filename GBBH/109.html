  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The mere mention of Alexander ignited a menacing glint in Sebastian's eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry, son. Once we secure the formula for magic powder, every power player in </span><span>Loscity</span><span> will line up to ally with the Brilliant Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No one will dare defy us, not even the Saint Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The dark sorcerer, Mr. Flemming, is on his way, and I'll personally greet him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Theodore's face lit up with excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the arrival of the dark sorcerer, there was a chance his health could be restored.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, at Astral Bistro, Oscar from the Kaylon was eagerly awaiting Alexander's arrival.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander! I've been waiting for you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Oscar beamed as he spotted Alexander stepping out of the car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since Alexander had helped alleviate his Parkinson's symptoms, their interactions had increased, deepening Oscar's understanding of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, is it true that you and Ms. Blackburn have split? If you're free, I'd love to offer you an executive position at the Kaylon. What do you think?" Oscar said, affectionately patting Alexander on the shoulder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The expressions of the Kaylon staff were a mix of surprise and confusion. Oscar was known for his strict demeanor, especially toward his subordinates, so his warm welcome for Alexander was unexpected.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander couldn't help but chuckle. "Haha, so you called me here to poach me?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Those rumors online are just that&mdash;rumors. Ava and I had a minor spat, but we're still </span><span>together."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Oscar's face fell slightly. If Alexander, with his skills and medical expertise, could join the Kaylon, it would be a game-changer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah, I knew those online rumors were nonsense. Well, no worries! Just let me know if you ever need anything. I'm here to help.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, come on! Astral Bistro has rolled out some new dishes that you absolutely have to try."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Oscar led Alexander through the VIP entrance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Astral Bistro was one of the most exclusive high-end restaurants in </span><span>Loscity</span><span>, a key asset of the Kaylon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Alexander and Oscar entered, laughing and chatting, a black Mercedes following them was stopped by security.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inside the car, </span><span>Lara</span><span>'s expression shifted between surprise and intrigue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can't believe it! That's Alexander, and Sir Stewart from the Kaylon! I didn't realize Alexander had such close ties with them. What could they possibly be discussing?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Oscar and Alexander walked ahead, flanked by a group of bodyguards and Astral Bistro staff.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The plush carpet stretched from the parking area to the interior, and several young women in form-fitting outfits hovered around Oscar and Alexander, ready to provide attentive service.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Alexander's first time in such an opulent restaurant, and he reveled in the treatment reserved for the elite&mdash;he felt like royalty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The private dining rooms at Astral Bistro were off-limits to the public; only the most elite families or top executives from the Kaylon could gain entry, no matter how deep one's pockets were.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Oscar subtly observed Alexander's reactions, expecting that someone from such humble beginnings might feel out of place in such extravagance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, Alexander remained calm and composed, displaying an ease that left Oscar quietly impressed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Outside Astral Bistro, Andrew, Belinda, Jane, and Felicity were waiting in line for their turn to enter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From their position, they could catch glimpses of the VIP entrance through the glass and floral arrangements.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Alexander and his entourage strode through, Andrew sighed with envy, "The VIP room must be open for some top-tier celebrity. I heard the minimum spend there is hundreds of thousands of dollars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If I can't experience that in my lifetime, what's the point of living?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Belinda shot him a glare.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You think I wouldn't want that? It's your lack of ambition and ability that's holding us back. If you don't step up, you'll never get in there, not even on your deathbed."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Andrew's face flushed with embarrassment, then he turned to his daughter Felicity, his eyes hopeful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Felicity, I'm getting old and losing my touch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But if you could land Mr. Gellar, the Fairfax family would become the new elite in </span><span>Loscity</span><span>. That would finally give me a shot at stepping into that world!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Belinda chimed in excitedly, "Exactly! If Felicity marries Mr. Gellar, we'll be living the good life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've heard they spend hundreds of thousands, even millions, in there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's hard to imagine just how lavish it must be."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The couple stared longingly at the VIP </span><span>entrance,</span><span> their eyes filled with greed.</span></p><div class="pagination">
