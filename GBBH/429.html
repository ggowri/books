I need a Lightsabers!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a sudden bite of his tongue, clarity surged through his chaotic thoughts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The last remnants of the Force inside him concentrated at the tip of the chisel as he made his final cut into the gemstone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Boom!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A thunderous sound echoed in his head, and a sharp pain shot through him as he collapsed heavily to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was the result of overextending himself&mdash;he was utterly exhausted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He struggled to lift his head to look at the gemstone on the table, which now emitted a faint yellow glow, pure and bright.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To his amazement, the top-quality yellow gemstone began to float, hovering gently in the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The surface of the gemstone flickered with golden, intricate patterns&mdash;one hundred and ten in total.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Energy Convergence Matrix was finally complete. Although this yellow gemstone wasn't the top-tier one he needed to use as an energy core for the Lightsabers, it would serve as an excellent talisman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He intended to gift it to Ava.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Filled with joy, Alexander realized that with this experience, once he fully restored his Force, he could carve the top-quality gemstone into the energy core.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Creating the Lightsabers would follow naturally; he had already prepared the mithril, fine gold, and meteoric iron needed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What he needed now was to restore his Force to its peak!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Master, what's wrong?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Rosalia rushed in, urgently wrapping her arms around Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm fine, just a bit worn out."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He felt the remarkable softness of Rosalia's body against him and chuckled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Previously, he relied on meditation to restore his Force, but now he found greater success through beautiful women.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They not only helped him recover his Force but could also absorb the Force of James.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He pressed Rosalia against the desk.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosalia gasped, a mixture of surprise and delight flooding her.
