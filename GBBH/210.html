As long as you help me become the head of the Hansen family, I'm yours to command."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander lost all restraint and immediately slipped his hand inside her neckline.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Not here; I'm afraid Ava will walk in..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lara gasped, pleading softly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander laughed. "Then why are you still teasing me? Didn't you say Ava has meetings? Let's do it here; it'll be more exciting than the bed."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lara felt her body heat up, losing all her strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let me check; it seems bigger."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander eagerly played with her voluptuous breasts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lara was already lost in the moment, allowing Alexander to kiss her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, I want you..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She gasped as her hand slipped into Alexander's pants.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's breathing quickened; Lara's beautiful secret garden was already a mess.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, it's so big..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Lara had some experience, she was still taken aback.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander felt a surge of triumph inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't you like it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He moved slowly, and Lara couldn't help but tremble all over, starting to babble...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the Hansen villa, Orion's face darkened, filled with worry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That bitch actually hooked up with Alexander!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He kicked the coffee table over in frustration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Orion had people secretly tracking Lara and discovered she had gone to Alexander's place, where they had been alone together for several hours before she left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A single man and a woman spending so much time together&mdash;anyone not a fool would know what was happening.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dad, is Alexander really that scary?" Jonas asked, somewhat confused.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Orion snorted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The disappearance of </span><span>Houtte</span><span> and David says it all. This Alexander is not to be underestimated. If Lara gets involved with him, we're in trouble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The old man said he'd announce the heir on the first of next month. We must find a way to ensure I succeed as head of the family!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jonas sneered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dad, if it were up to me, I'd just hire a hitman to get rid of Lara and Alexander&mdash;end of story."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Orion pondered for a moment, revealing a cruel smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Good, let's do it! Son, find a powerful hitman on the Dark Web; don't worry about the cost."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jonas excitedly patted his chest to assure him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry, Dad. I'll handle it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next day, Alexander arranged to meet Xavier early, asking him to take him gem shopping.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was a famous jewelry street nearby, and the Ulysses family's Fiery Gem Trading was located there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This street had dozens of jewelry stores, and many small vendors set up stalls selling various gems and minerals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Besides these, there were even some rare and peculiar items.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>According to Xavier, those items were related to witchcraft and Deadly Hex materials.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander couldn't help but recall the City of Sorcery. Ever since the dark wizard and the Tate father and son were killed, Guzman had been quiet for a while, and even the mysterious second brother hadn't attacked him again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was clear that Alexander's displayed strength had shocked them, but they certainly wouldn't give up easily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The retaliation from the City of Sorcery would eventually come!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Alexander appeared calm on the surface, he felt a constant sense of urgency to strengthen his abilities quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fortunately, he had been spending a lot of time with several beautiful women lately, and he had refined quite a bit of the Force that James left behind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, these small vendors usually don't have quality items. I can assure </span><span>you,</span><span> the Ulysses family owns a large portion of the high-quality gems on this street."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Xavier enthusiastically explained.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Julia returned from the auction, she repeatedly instructed Xavier to maintain a good relationship with Alexander at all costs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two of them controlled the Phoenix Gemstone Establishment but faced significant pressure from the Ulysses family members.</span></p><div class="pagination">
