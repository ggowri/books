  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander smiled faintly, standing against the wind, his deep eyes piercing through the night, gazing at the Black Dragon Gang's camp in the distance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'll go. Launch the attack in five minutes!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The next second, Alexander appeared a hundred feet away with astonishing speed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, no one could see where he was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"He's so fast!" everyone exclaimed as his speed was totally beyond their expectations.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'm a little worried about him," Marvin muttered to himself a little worriedly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Augusta said with a confident smile, "Don't worry, this is child's play for him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although Alexander was completely out of sight, everyone had their eyes wide open, fully focused on the direction where he disappeared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As time ticked by, the five minutes seemed as long as a century, yet also seemed to pass in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Dragon Gang's camp remained silent as if no battle had taken place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Let's rush over at top speed!" Augusta waved his hand excitedly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Immediately, over a thousand people rushed towards the camp.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The sound of footsteps and startled birds and beasts broke the original silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone tightened their grip on their guns; the battle was about to begin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Over a thousand people rushed out of the jungle, forming a dense, dark mass.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Logically speaking, the Dragon Gang should have spotted them by now and opened fire fiercely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Strange things happened; there was not a single sound within the camp, let alone any attacks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon, Augusta and his subordinates successfully surrounded the camp. The Dragon Gang did not fire a single shot, let alone use any howitzers; they were completely silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this point, many people had already caught the scent of blood in the sea breeze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They were all seasoned elites, battle-hardened, and most sensitive to the smell of blood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They began to occupy the camp, discovering numerous bodies that were still slightly warm in each of the guard posts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>There were also many bodies lying haphazardly behind rocks, in tents, and among the bushes. The gruesome scene was indescribable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As they delved deeper into the camp, the stench of blood in the air grew stronger, and the number of corpses increased.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone was shocked; they didn't expect Alexander to launch a massacre.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Someone made a rough estimate that at least one-third of the Dragon Gang's force, which numbered in the thousands, had been killed, and there were still many bodies that had not been counted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They followed behind effortlessly as if they were on a sightseeing trip.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Who's that? Enemy attack!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Suddenly, a roar erupted from the tent in the very center of the camp.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Immediately after, several gunshots rang out, followed by a loud boom, and the entire tent was torn to pieces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Three tall and burly men appeared; they were the Napper brothers, wearing combat armor. Their armored bodies gleamed with a faint light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After rushing out, they found that half of the camp was already destroyed, and enemies surrounded them everywhere. They immediately let out a roar of fury, "Kill them all!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The three brothers, all metahumans with special abilities, could push the combat effectiveness of their combat armor to the extreme.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They raised their rapid-fire machine guns, spewing out terrifying streams of fire, launching a fierce attack on a ghostly figure not far away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, as soon as the guns fired, Alexander had already vanished under the cover of night, refusing to engage in a direct confrontation with them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, the entire camp was enveloped in the intense sound of gunfire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Augusta, along with his subordinates, began to launch a frenzied assault, pouring fierce firepower onto the enemy like rain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Son of a bitch, you just launched a sneak attack! Face me!" Casper's eyes were already red with urgency.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The camp was already destroyed, with heavy losses among the subordinates; it was definitely impossible to occupy Devil Island.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But as a level-two metahuman, wearing combat armor that significantly boosted combat effectiveness, Casper was far from willing to give up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, Casper locked onto Alexander and opened fire again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A hail of bullets rained down, but his target had vanished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Casper, watch out!" Kermit warned his brother, drew his battle knife made of special steel, and dashed towards Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Kermit!" Aidan roared, raising the specially made shield to cover Kermit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With a dull sound, the shield that could block machine gun bullets was easily penetrated by the Lightsaber.</span></p><div class="pagination">
