  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander frowned. "Good thing I only bet a thousand coins on Braylon."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Logan, the Valdez brothers, and Nova cheered excitedly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vegeta stared at Rhodes and muttered to himself, "One day, I'll defeat him for sure!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Massive torches burned all around the training grounds, illuminating the area as if it were daytime.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was now break time. Rhodes and Hogan stepped down from the stage, and food vendors appeared throughout the training grounds, calling out their offerings. The spectators dispersed to grab a meal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, the competition resumed. In another hour, the annual Dominion Church tournament would come to an end.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The golden pass arena remained empty. No one stepped forward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rhodes held the silver pass stage, while Hogan stood on the bronze pass stage. Unless something unexpected happened, they would be the top contenders in their respective groups.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, deep within the crowd, Julius was fuming.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What the hell is wrong with your cousin? Why hasn't he challenged yet?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His lackey bowed repeatedly, trying to appease him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Another half-hour passed. Just as the audience was starting to lose interest, Rhodes suddenly exhaled sharply and spoke in a booming voice that echoed across the entire arena.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I am Rhodes Monroe. I would like to spar with the warrior who killed the Risunese level-four fighter, Alexander Hawthorne!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd fell into stunned silence for a moment before erupting into cheers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The women Alexander and his group had rescued had already spread word of what had happened at Walgus Church.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rumors circulated that a young hero had slain the Risunese level-four warrior. People spoke of him as a true legend.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing two warriors face off today made the trip worthwhile. The crowd was thrilled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander sneered inwardly. He knew Rhodes had ulterior motives. A half-step level-five warrior challenging a level-three warrior. This wasn't a spar; it was a death match. He didn't even know Rhodes personally. Was Julius behind this?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Logan grabbed Alexander in a panic. "Alexander, you can't go up there!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sellers and Enoch exchanged glances before saying firmly, "You can't do this."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vegeta and Nova bowed. "Sir, let us fight in your place."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander chuckled. "Relax, guys. I'm not that stupid. I don't have a death wish!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing no response, Rhodes raised his voice again. "Could it be that Alexander Hawthorne is all talk? Was it really you who killed the level-four Risunese warrior?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Outer Court disciples and townspeople fell silent. It was obvious now. These two had a grudge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander clenched his jaw.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Logan shouted, "Screw you! You're a level-four warrior, and my bro is level three! What kind of sparring is that?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rhodes had never been insulted like this before. His face twisted with fury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You savage! Watch your mouth! A true martial artist faces hardships head-on. If you don't even dare to spar, how can you claim to walk the warrior's path?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the crowd, Julius laughed loudly, slapping his lackey on the shoulder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Perfect! If he goes up there, he dies. If he doesn't, his martial heart will waver, and he'll never improve!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander frowned. If he stepped onto that stage, things wouldn't end well. But if he refused, his conviction would waver, possibly blocking his future progress. Rhodes was clearly out to kill him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the review platform, Declan, Huxley, and Fermin sat in silence, their brows furrowed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isolde, pale and restless, suddenly stood up. She walked over to the two priests, pressing her palms together in a respectful gesture before speaking softly, "Masters, Rhodes Monroe is a half-step level-five warrior! Alexander is only level three. How is this even fair..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Madden took a sip from his clay cup. "They're both in the silver pass group. Challenging each other is allowed."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fermin let out a cold snort. "Alexander saved the princess, helped take down a level-four Risunese warrior, and is a martial prodigy. This so-called sparring match is inappropriate."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Declan and Huxley exchanged a glance and slowly waved their large fans. Seeing the distress in Isolde's tear-filled eyes, they understood the situation clearly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Declan sighed. "Enough!" He raised his hand, summoning a middle-aged priest warrior. After whispering a few words to him, the priest hurried toward the arena.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander clenched his fists so tightly that his nails dug into his palms. His blood boiled with determination. He refused to be a coward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A mere half-step level-five warrior? Compared to the overwhelming power within the Dominion Church's inner halls, Rhodes was nothing!</span></p><div class="pagination">
