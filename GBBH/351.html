  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry. I will help you solve the problem completely. No one will dare to collect protection fees on this street in the future!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's firm words made everyone cheer and applaud.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He lifted Wesley and threw him to the ground like trash, causing him to wail in pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Call your boss over. I want to talk to him," Alexander ordered in an unquestionable tone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wesley was immediately delighted. That was great. Once his boss, Arthur, came, Alexander would definitely be in trouble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He endured the severe pain in his hand and made a phone call tremblingly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Arthur, please come here right now. While collecting the money, we met a tough guy who beat us up and said he wanted to talk to you..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Wesley hung up, Alexander asked these hooligans to line up in the street and wait for Arthur.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The elderly man hesitated and said, "Sir, you should leave now. Arthur is a formidable bully in this neighborhood. He has something to do with the Mafia and kills people mercilessly."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander maintained a polite smile. "I've promised to solve this matter thoroughly. I won't leave until then."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The elderly man was anxious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sir, that's the Mafia. I am very grateful to you, but I don't want a kind person like you to get hurt."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brittany smiled sweetly, "Don't worry. We will bear all the consequences ourselves."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, she leaned close to Alexander's ear and whispered, "I know you are capable, but you have to be careful."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He caught a glimpse of the deep cleavage on her chest and couldn't help but look at it a few more times.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What are you looking at? I'm talking to you about something serious." Brittany scolded coquettishly, but she placed her hand on the inside of Alexander's thigh and touched it gently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was immediately aroused. She always seduced him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under the influence of alcohol, he couldn't help but hold her in his arms and kiss her deeply in front of everyone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, there was a burst of good-natured laughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After the kiss, Brittany's pretty face flushed, and she gazed at Alexander affectionately with her charming eyes as if eager to make love to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get out of the way! Get out of the way!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Make way! Arthur is coming."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, with shouts, the crowd of onlookers was dispersed by a dozen muscular men.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They surrounded Alexander aggressively.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the sight of them, nearby storekeepers immediately retreated in fear. Arthur arrived.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was a middle-aged man, standing in the middle of the hooligans, with a crew cut, a pockmarked face, and fierce eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Coupled with his height of nearly 6.5 feet, he was sturdy and robust, with an imposing aura.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he saw his men standing in a line obediently, his face instantly darkened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wesley rushed over, howling and begging, "Arthur, you are finally here. You must avenge us!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Others also complained, "Arthur, it's that bastard. He injured us badly. You must avenge us!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Arthur glared at Alexander with a sullen face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was stunned at first glance and then stared at him carefully with wide eyes, his </span><span>heart racing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was the guy with a considerable bounty on his head on the Dark Web!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He probably had no idea that someone wanted to take his life. That was a bounty of 100 million dollars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To Arthur's surprise, he ran into him here. What a stroke of luck!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander fixed his eyes on Arthur indifferently. His calm air made Arthur cautious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, someone offered 100 million dollars on the Dark Web to kill Alexander. He was definitely not an ordinary person.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And although Wesley's fighting skills were not good, ordinary people couldn't defeat him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you Wesley's boss?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's tone was as cold as ice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Arthur couldn't help but shiver, and his heart beat faster.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's eyes were sharp, and his aura was terrifying, making Arthur feel like he was being targeted by a man-eating beast.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under the watchful eyes of the public, Arthur could not give in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stared at Alexander and asked viciously, "Did you beat up my men?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, I did. What do you want?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander gazed at him with contempt.</span></p><div class="pagination">
