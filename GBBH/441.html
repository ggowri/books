That's my grandpa, why did you send him to a nursing home? Do you think you can scare me by bringing so many people with you just because you are Ava's man?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander ignored her and said calmly, "Smash it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alice agreed loudly, then turned around and waved to her subordinates.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Smash it hard! Smash everything in the Fairfax Villa!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hundreds of men in black shouted in unison, "Okay!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sound was like thunder, frightening Jane and Belinda so much that they trembled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next moment, hundreds of people rushed into the Fairfax Villa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Fairfax family bought this mansion after they received 100 million dollars from Felix. They spent a lot of effort to decorate it and spent tens of millions of dollars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bang!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A branded table worth hundreds of thousands of dollars was smashed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sizzle!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A luxurious leather sofa worth hundreds of thousands of dollars was chopped into pieces with an axe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Crash!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Exquisite and expensive furnishings were smashed, electrical appliances were thrown to the ground, and even the bed sheets and curtains were taken down, piled together, and set on fire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The mansion that the Fairfax Villa had just moved into was instantly in ruins and engulfed in flames.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't smash it! Please don't smash it! Please..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Belinda wailed in pain, but no one cared about her at all, and instead, they became even more ruthless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane wanted to stop them but was stopped by several big men in black.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, you bastard, you will die a horrible death!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Hollister, aren't you the secretary of the chairman of the Saint Group? Why should you listen to this bastard? You're not afraid of Ava!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane screamed and wailed in despair and finally burst into tears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A smile appeared on Alexander's face, and he felt happy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn you, Alexander, you still dare to laugh?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane and Belinda were so angry that they wanted to rush to fight Alexander, but they were pushed to the ground by several big men.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at the miserable appearance of them and the raging fire burning in the Fairfax Villa, Alexander felt happy and comfortable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the end, Belinda and Jane collapsed on the ground, watching their new home turn into ruins.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander lifted Jane's chin with his hand and warned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is the price you should pay. If you do bad things again, I will no longer let you go, even if you're Ashley's mother."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After giving the warning, Alexander left with his men.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, he was in a very good mood, and even his steps became lighter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Belinda was like a wooden doll, staring lifelessly at the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane murmured in despair, "Alexander, you're going too far..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After leaving the Fairfax Villa, Alexander immediately arranged for Charlize to bring a few more people to secretly strengthen the protection of Ashley, and then he felt relieved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He also thought that since Felix had already quietly arrived in </span><span>Loscity</span><span>, there must have been a strong man who had used the Level 2 power elixir hiding in the dark.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were even metahumans cultivated with potential potions who possessed some special abilities. After all, the potential potion was developed by the Red Umbrella Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander felt that he should quickly forge the lightsaber to enhance his strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Warriors were divided into eight levels; they were Novice, Intermediate, Advanced, Expert, master, Sovereign, Epic, and Legendary.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lightsabers also had levels from one to nine!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Alexander believed that even the lowest level lightsaber must be extremely powerful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Hollister, I will be in seclusion for three days. I must not be disturbed by the outside world during these three days. Please plan the security measures."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's serious tone startled Alice, and her expression suddenly became nervous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne, please rest assured, I will arrange the strongest security measures!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander nodded and said, "Very good."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alice was suddenly disappointed. She hadn't had a chance to make out with Alexander in the past two days. She was looking forward to it, but when Alexander said he wanted to go into seclusion, so she was very disappointed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander saw through Alice's thoughts at a glance. His All-seeing Eyes had already seen that Alice was wearing sexy underwear, and it was obvious that she came prepared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He chuckled, suddenly picked up Alice, and disappeared into the distance like the wind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His subordinates following behind were all startled, then surprised and happy. Alexander ran so fast. They wondered if he was a human being.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne, I miss you so much. It would be great if I could be by your side every day like Rosalia and Charlize do."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the study, Alice put her arms around Alexander's neck and spoke coquettishly in a sweet voice.</span></p><div class="pagination">
