  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander felt himself buried between two soft, warm mounds, barely able to breathe, on the verge of explosion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Please, have me!" Ava cried out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She seemed to melt in Alexander's arms, her body going limp as he toyed with her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In his excitement, Alexander tore at Ava's white blouse, the buttons flying off, revealing her enchanting figure like an angel.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just as they were getting tangled up on the carpet, about to be swept away by a storm of passion, Alexander suddenly froze.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His phone buzzed with a message from Anne.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He glanced at the screen, and his face darkened in fury.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">[Mr. Hawthorne, Ashley has been poisoned. Come to the hospital immediately!]</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In her dazed state, Ava was still clinging to Alexander.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But the sight of his daughter in danger extinguished any mood he had.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He quickly activated the Force to purge the effects of the magic powder from Ava's system.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I want..." Ava murmured, her hand slipping into Alexander's pants, searching.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander almost lost control again, hastening the Force's operation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As the effects of the drug were swiftly eliminated from Ava, she sighed softly and fell into a deep sleep.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander gently laid her on the bed, locked the door, and instructed Charlize to keep watch from the shadows before rushing to the hospital.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the ICU, Ashley lay pale and weak, undergoing treatment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Despite the frantic efforts of the medical staff, dark blood kept flowing from her nostrils, dripping onto the pillow and sheets.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Damn it!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Whoever poisoned my daughter, you will pay for this. I'll make sure of it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Fury blazing in his eyes, Alexander exuded an aura of deadly intent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He shoved aside the helpless doctors, lifted his daughter, and used the Force to assess her condition.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was clear she had been poisoned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Though he couldn't identify the toxin, he was relieved to have discovered it in time to expel it with the Force.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander thought, "Could Sebastian or Guzman be behind this? No, Sebastian wouldn't dare after I dealt with him, and Godfather ordered no harm to Ashley.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">So, who could it be?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Hmm. Whoever it is, they're about to be very disappointed. They have no idea I possess the Ultimate Legacy."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander's rage turned into a grim smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He worked with all his might to help his daughter purge the poison.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Soon, more dark blood flowed from Ashley's nose and ears.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The doctors and nurses were baffled by Alexander's actions, and some tried to intervene but were forcefully pushed aside by Anne and her team.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Once the toxins were cleared from Ashley's system, her color began to return.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Daddy... is that you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ashley's eyes fluttered open slightly, her voice a soft murmur.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tears streamed down Alexander's face as he kissed her forehead.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After the surgery and with the additional poisoning, her condition had worsened, and she soon fell back into a deep sleep.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Having saved his daughter's life, Alexander radiated a menacing aura.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He quietly covered her with a blanket and, with a wave of his hand, expelled everyone from the room so she could rest.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Anne lowered her head and spoke quietly, "Mr. Hawthorne, I'm sorry. The culprit committed suicide before we could apprehend him... It might not be Mr. Augustine Hawthorne. It could be Mr. Anthony Hawthorne..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander's face remained impassive as he waved his hand dismissively. "Find out! If it's confirmed to be my second brother, he's going to hell."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The chilling threat made Anne shiver, her back drenched in a cold sweat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At that moment, in a dark and foreboding hall, a grey-haired elder received the news of his granddaughter's poisoning.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His hunched posture straightened abruptly, and his cold voice cut through the silence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Shadow, do we know who did this?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A shadowy figure materialized from the darkness, bowing deeply before the elder.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Godfather, while it's not a hundred percent confirmed yet, it appears to be someone affiliated with Mr. Anthony Hawthorne. The intention seems to be to frame Mr. Augustine Hawthorne and intensify the conflict between Mr. Hawthorne and Mr. Augustine Hawthorne."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The silver-haired elder smashed the crystal ashtray onto the floor, shattering it into pieces.</p><div class="pagination">
