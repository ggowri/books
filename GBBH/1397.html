  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fermin's sword stabbed several inches into Misael's right shoulder. The purple protective energy burst out, yet it still couldn't kill Misael, a level-five warrior.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Misael had been stabbed by Fermin's wards, and his throat was being fiercely struck by Alexander. Misael was badly injured, but he was still alive. The firmness of his body was comparable to that of the diamond.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah!" Misael roared. His warrior's uniform surged. He held the saber with both hands, ready to cut Alexander in half.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander sensed an extreme danger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All the hairs on his body stood on end in an instant. An intense and icy chill rushed from the base of his spine straight to his head. In a moment, an extremely powerful and scorching warm current surged from the golden energy in his left chest to the Black Iron Ring on his right middle finger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as the scorching warm current entered the ring, the ring shone with a dazzling golden light. Faint dragon roars could be heard. At this moment, Alexander's fist struck straight at Misael's throat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was as easy as a knife cutting through butter. Misael's head was instantly separated from his body, and it flew several feet away. Black blood spurted into the air from the neck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Misael's wide-open eyes were full of shock, confusion, and venom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander stroked the Black Iron Ring, feeling extremely shocked. He thought, "Misael's neck is as hard as a diamond, making a clanging sound when I struck it. But just now, one punch could break it as easily as cutting butter. Could this ring really be a divine's relic?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When the other Risunese saw that Misael, a level-five warrior, had been killed, they let out strange cries, threw down their weapons, and fled toward Hero Gorge desperately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fermin looked at Misael's head, filled with amazement. Just as he was about to step forward to ask, he suddenly turned to look in the direction of Hero Gorge, raised his saber, and roared, "Form ranks!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sound of the ox-horn bugle rang out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The 500 thousand Hrodvik soldiers didn't go after those fleeing Risunese. In an instant, they formed into large square formations.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the front row were heavily armored infantrymen. They inserted the tower shields, which were over a person tall, straight into the ground and held them firmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Behind them were leather-armored archers and javelin-throwers, all holding powerful crossbows and flying axes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the back were light-armored infantrymen. A dense forest of long spears pointed straight into the night sky.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the two sides were 200 thousand elite cavalry. They were strong, and the horses were robust, exuding overwhelming momentum.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander stood in the ranks, covering his chest with his left hand, taking out a Docpirin with his right hand, and swallowing it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was very nervous. An extremely powerful internal energy was approaching, much stronger than that of Fermin and Misael.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Frieza sneered, "Damn it! Misael's internal energy has also disappeared. Just now, there was a powerful internal energy, and the power instantly exceeded ten thousand, making me feel a slight threat. Could it be Fermin? No matter who it is, anyone who dares to kill my subordinates must die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Frieza was in mid-air. His large triangular eyes were bloodshot. His strange, bean-sized pupils seemed to be burning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fermin, Alexander, and the 500 thousand Hrodvik soldiers all stared intently at the short figure in mid-air. Everyone felt extremely oppressed. Sweat rolled down their faces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fermin took out a thumb-sized golden bead. Mysterious and complex characters on the bead loomed faintly. He suddenly crushed the bead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In mid-air, the sounds of chanting, bells, and drums suddenly rang out. A huge colorful cloud enveloped the army.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A faint colorful glow appeared on everyone. Their muscles bulged, their figures grew larger, and their whole body's strength surged. They were filled with boundless strength and courage. Streams of unwavering killing aura converged on Fermin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fermin pointed his saber at the short strange figure in mid-air. An extremely fierce and devouring invisible aura enveloped the figure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The combat power detector on Frieza's left eye flickered wildly. Suddenly, with a bang, the glass piece of the combat power detector exploded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Frieza was surprised, thinking, "These Hrodvik people seem to have some skills. They can actually gather their strength together. This colorful cloud seems to have a strong defense...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There might be an expert in the Divine Transformation State inside. This strike... Damn!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Frieza instantly turned around. A huge, scarlet, and dazzling air wave spurted from his feet. His short figure shot towards Hero Gorge like a comet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as Frieza was far away, there was a clang. The saber fell to the ground. Fermin's face turned deathly pale, and he spat out a mouthful of blood. Everyone around Fermin immediately stepped forward to support him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fermin waved his hand and said weakly, "It's okay. Fortunately, that person retreated. Otherwise, I would have exploded and died."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As soon as they heard this and let go, Fermin collapsed.</span></p><div class="pagination">
