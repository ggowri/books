  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ryan's frame quivered with rage.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He yelled, "Alexander, what gives you the right to judge us? A piece of trash like you at such an elite event?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"How dare you vie with me? I'm the newly appointed vice president. Ms. Hollister personally handed me the invitation. What right do you have to challenge me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Who dares cause a scene here?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">An irate shout cut through the tension.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The Security Chief, Max Blake, marched over with his team, encircling the trio.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jane brandished the invitation like a shield.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"We're invited! My husband, Ryan Hawkins, is about to become the Saint Group's vice president. This man is Alexander Hawthorne. He's nothing but a gatecrasher!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Max's stare turned icy as it landed on Alexander.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Sir, your invitation, please."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With serene confidence, Alexander replied, "I have none. A friend brought me in."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Max was stunned. It wasn't just anyone who could waltz into this exclusive event with guests in tow; it demanded a level of influence that was rare and revered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He thought, "In the entire Saint Group, only three possessed such power. They were the chairman, Ms. Blackburn, and Ms. Hollister."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Sir, might I inquire which of our executives you are acquainted with?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Max's tone remained courteous.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Before Alexander could respond, Jane erupted into mocking laughter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"How could he be a friend of the Saint Group's executives? That's hilarious. He's my ex, a jobless failure!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ryan's sneer was thick with disdain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"This wretch is bottom-tier scum. He's here with some dark intent."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander ignored them and lifted a glass of red wine from a nearby table, savoring a sip.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"My business is not yours to question."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His audacity stunned the onlookers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Max's fury mounted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was a ball hosted by the new chairman. Max knew that any security lapse could spell disaster for him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Take this man to the isolation room for questioning," he ordered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The guards advanced.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Stop!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A melodious command halted them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava appeared as she furiously shielded Alexander.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ryan's heart skipped with initial joy at seeing his dream woman, only to be consumed by jealousy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava was breathtakingly gorgeous. Her icy demeanor made every other woman seem lackluster.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jane paled in comparison to Ava. Here, at this ball where beauty was in abundance, Ava was unparalleled, who made even the stars above seem dim.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Damn it! Alexander plays the gigolo. She must have brought him," Jane spat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her heart thrummed with a mix of anxiety and seething anger. The man she had once cast aside was now intimately close with a woman whose affluence and radiant beauty made her feel utterly eclipsed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The sensation was akin to a child who discarded a toy, bored of its once cherished presence, only to watch in dismay as another child picked it up with eyes full of wonder, treating it like a newfound treasure.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Clutching Alexander's hand, Ava declared with pride, "Alexander is my chosen partner for the dance. I brought him. Any objections?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Max nearly collapsed in fear.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The Saint Group's rules were unforgiving. To defy one's superiors was to court death itself, presented with a macabre choice: thirteen methods of execution.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Unaware of the gravity, Jane pointed at Ava and venomously cursed, "It's you. You bitch! You take my cast-off and parade him like treasure. Have you never seen a man in all your lives?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A collective gasp swept through the crowd. At least half of the attendees were well-acquainted with Ava. No one had anticipated that anyone would have the audacity to publicly slight Ava.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Seeing an opportunity to redeem himself, Max struck Jane across the face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You're the bitch! Do you wish for death? Ms. Blackburn is the president of the Saint Group!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jane covered her cheeks, now aflame with both the sting of the slap and the heat of humiliation. She stood in disbelief.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Ms. Blackburn? Which Ms. Blackburn?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Max slapped her again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jane stumbled, and her complexion looked ghostly pale.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She thought, "How could Alexander be worthy of Ava, the president of the Saint Group?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This must be a nightmare."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In a moment of desperate disbelief, she pinched her own skin with a reluctant force. The sharp pain that followed was a cruel confirmation of reality.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The crowd's scornful gazes pierced her heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ryan spent a while recovering from his stupor.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He forced a smile, extending his hand toward Ava with sycophantic charm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Ms. Blackburn, I'm Ryan Hawkins. I'm to be appointed vice president by the chairman. Let's foster a good working relationship."</p><div class="pagination">
