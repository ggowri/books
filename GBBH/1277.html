  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander pedaled his bike through the city streets like a knight on a mission, finally making his way to the quiet country roads.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as he'd hoped, there weren't many zombies out here, and he hadn't spotted any mutant animals either.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though occasional zombies would catch his scent and stumble toward him, Alexander just zoomed past them on his bike.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Watching the zombies fall further and further behind, he felt a sudden rush of childlike joy. It reminded him of his childhood, and he had the urge to break into song.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hold up," he muttered to himself, bringing his bike to a stop as something caught his eye up ahead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was a small farm in the distance&mdash;a poultry operation, according to the advertising signs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rows of coops stretched out around a small lake, disappearing into the distance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A pickup truck was parked by the roadside next to a small building with a general store sign hanging outside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>About a dozen zombies were clustered together, feasting on what looked like their latest victim.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The poor soul must have been killed recently. The body was still mostly intact, though it was already a bloody mess.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Man, talk about being in the wrong place at the wrong time." Alexander shook his head. If only this person had run into him earlier, they might still be alive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He considered taking a detour around the scene, but his bottled water supply was running low. He needed to find some clean drinking water soon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>People could survive without food, but water was non-negotiable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He parked his bike and gripped his worn-down machete, striding purposefully toward a group of about a dozen zombies having their own grotesque feast.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One clean hit to the head was all it took for each zombie. For Alexander, these regular zombies barely posed a challenge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After taking care of the threat, Alexander made his way into the convenience store.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a small shop without much left on the shelves, but there was plenty of bottled water. Alexander found a large canvas bag and stuffed it with dozens of water bottles, throwing in several six-packs of beer for good measure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He checked the pickup truck's gas tank nearby, but it was running empty. "Shame," he muttered. "I could've loaded up the bike and driven out of here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Out here in the suburbs, a few zombies wouldn't stand a chance against a pickup truck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, Alexander caught a faint noise coming from a nearby barn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There might be mutated beasts in there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's expression turned serious as he gripped his knife and walked toward the source of the sound.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he cracked open the door and peeked inside, he spotted a slim figure. Surprisingly, it was a woman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She stood there staring at him in disbelief as if she couldn't process seeing another living person.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was absolutely filthy. Chicken and duck droppings covered her from head to toe. The stench was overwhelming, and her clothes were so caked in filth that their original style and color were unrecognizable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You haven't turned into a zombie?" Alexander couldn't hide his surprise and relief. This was the first living person he'd encountered since arriving in Kylaville.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come on out!" Alexander yanked the barn door open and gestured outside. "You need to get cleaned up."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stepped back, covering his nose. The smell was unbearable. He wondered how she'd managed to stand it in there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he had to admire her survival instinct. Zombies had an incredibly keen sense of smell, and hiding in such a putrid place was exactly what had kept her alive and undetected all this time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey, it's safe out here now!" he called out again. "You can come out and wash up!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the woman didn't move. She just stood there trembling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fine, I'm leaving if you won't come out," Alexander said, making a show of turning to walk away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The woman let out a scream and bolted outside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the sunlight hit her face, she squinted and raised her hands to shield her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander sized her up. She was quite attractive, with a good figure. He figured she couldn't have been starving. Her curves were still plenty full.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After catching her breath, she gave Alexander a quick "thank you" before rushing toward the lake.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She jumped straight into the water and started frantically scrubbing away the filth on her body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Having been trapped in that breeding pen, she'd gotten used to the stench. But now, with fresh air in her lungs, the smell on her skin became unbearable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smiled to himself as he headed into the general store. He grabbed a bar of soap, a fresh towel, and a clean set of pajamas for her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After leaving the supplies by the lake's edge, he settled onto a nearby rock and started cleaning his dulled machete.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you!" the woman called out, her face flushed with embarrassment as she carefully stripped down to wash herself.</span></p><div class="pagination">
