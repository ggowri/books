  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It turned out that Diego had transparent threads wrapped around his fingers, connected to the flying knife handles, allowing him to control them and make them spin at will.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The knives flew back even faster than before, and Alexander barely dodged them in time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was taken aback. Diego was extremely skilled, and his attacks were tricky and hard to predict.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diego was even more shocked. He had launched a full-on lethal attack, yet hadn't managed to touch Alexander at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diego swung his hands, launching several more knives.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, over a dozen knives were flying around Alexander, aiming to strike.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Clang!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander casually drew his lightsaber and swung it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A white blade flashed through the air, producing a terrifying sound like thunder and wind roaring together.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Two knives split cleanly in half and dropped to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Clang! Clang!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Almost instantly, more knives shattered in quick succession, sliced by the lightsaber and falling to the floor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the blink of an eye, Diego and Alexander had exchanged several rounds, and more than half of Diego's knives lay destroyed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is bad!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diego sensed intense danger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that split second, Alexander let out a piercing, resonant cry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stomped hard, shattering the marble floor beneath him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From the point of impact, web-like cracks spread, and a powerful, invisible shockwave surged out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The entire room trembled. Whether Diego, Barry or the men from The Kaylon, staggered, losing their footing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander, unaffected, swung his sword toward Diego.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Morris, run!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diego retreated instead of advancing, twisting his body to block the blade with two of his knives.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Clang!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The knives were sliced through, and the blade grazed Diego's waist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diego's upper body lifted off as he attempted one last move, reaching fiercely for Alexander's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His ten fingernails were blackened, clearly laced with poison.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Alexander was too quick, dodging like lightning. Diego couldn't even touch him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diego's body, severed in two, fell heavily to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blood flowed freely across the floor, filling the air with a sharp metallic scent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone's faces turned pale; if they had faced Alexander, they would have fallen even faster than Diego.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barry finally snapped out of his shock. The battle between Alexander and Diego had only lasted a moment, leaving no chance for others to intervene.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As a level-three metahuman with speed abilities, Barry's fist had already reached Alexander's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as everyone thought Alexander would be hit, he flashed a sly grin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a sudden burst of Force, Force Confinement activated!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This strike posed a real threat, but only because Alexander hadn't been using much of his power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Force Confinement active, the entire world around Alexander slowed down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Barry's fist moved at a snail's pace, inching closer little by little.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this rate, it would take half a day just to reach Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barry's fierce expression was crystal clear, yet Alexander's movements remained </span><span>almost unaffected.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As everyone looked on in a daze, Alexander and Barry passed each other.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barry let out a scream, blood spraying as he was flung backward, rolling out of the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"After him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't let him get away!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd rushed out of the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander quickly followed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joyce had already broken under his pressure and confessed everything. Alexander now understood the skills of Diego and Barry, and he saw why Felix would want them as allies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander wondered how many more powerful fighters like them the Morris family had; the Morris family was clearly no ordinary force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't let Barry escape back to Felix. Letting them get away would spell trouble down the road.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Vroom! Vroom!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The underground parking lot echoed with the powerful roar of an engine as a silver sports car shot out and quickly disappeared into the depths of the dark night.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it! They got away."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cole growled, swinging his fist angrily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just earlier, Barry had sprinted toward the underground parking lot. Felix, quick on his feet, had already stolen a car, filled it up, and was waiting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he saw Diego staggering over, Felix realized things had gone wrong.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without hesitation, Felix started the car, taking Barry with him as they sped away into the night.</span></p><div class="pagination">
