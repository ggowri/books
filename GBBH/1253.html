  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fiona laughed softly, covering her mouth. "Thirty strokes? You must've miscounted; it's only a little over ten! But don't worry, this time will definitely be different."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, she picked up speed, as if charging across the open plains like a skilled rider on a stallion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Oswald felt like he might just take off into the air, yet he gritted his teeth to hold back, his hands gripping Fiona's generous curves, fingers sinking into her soft flesh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The container echoed with intoxicating moans, reminiscent of a cat in the throes of springtime passion, a sound both alluring and wild.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, those holding the front lines remained blissfully ignorant of the classic love story unfolding just out of sight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The night had fallen, and real danger was lurking just around the corner.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The workers at </span><span>Louvian</span><span> Port were ordinary people; shrouded in darkness, they couldn't see far into the distance. But the mutated beasts had a different advantage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Especially those that thrived in nocturnal conditions; their mutations had enhanced their vision and senses exponentially.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander felt a nagging worry; the military reinforcements hadn't arrived, and Quentin's promised air support was nowhere to be seen. Something must have gone awry!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As thoughts of the Sakra Society's dealings with high-profile individuals crossed his mind, his expression darkened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was only one explanation: Yinson, in a bid to validate his Apocalypse Project and deal with Alexander, had cut off supplies to Treasure Island using those influential backers to delay reinforcements, ensuring </span><span>Louvian</span><span> Port remained vulnerable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although anxious, Alexander chose not to spread panic among his comrades.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The makeshift walls&mdash;both above and below&mdash;were illuminated by several bonfires, their flames leaping high.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Strong logs soaked in oil fueled the fires, creating a blazing warmth that pushed back the cold and shadows.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The flames cast an orange glow over those around, bringing a glimmer of life to their pale faces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A group of women, young and old, were busy preparing food; they hadn't gone to the front lines.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When the beast wave hit, they'd felt a surge of terror, but now, some smiles had crept onto their faces, replacing sheer panic with a hint of hope.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite the terrifying threat of the beasts, their defenses held strong&mdash;for now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the promise of military aid, they found renewed strength in their labor, their cooking becoming </span><span>more nimble</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They might've been whipping up simple sandwiches and vegetable soup, but every member of the group poured their heart into the meal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the warmth of the fire and a satisfying meal, their spirits visibly lifted, restoring some of their energy and morale.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Alexander and his companions remained vigilant atop the wall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the pitch-black night, those with greater strength had heightened senses&mdash;particularly Alexander, who could make out the movements of the beast horde far in the distance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After fierce battles, the beasts had also suffered heavy losses and were temporarily regrouping, likely gathering strength for a more relentless assault.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Norah's beautiful face showed signs of exhaustion, but she remained steadfast by Alexander's side.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had urged her several times to take a break, yet Norah wouldn't budge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Augusta and the others stood nearby, staring into the inky darkness, lost in their own thoughts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Fiona and Oswald emerged from the container, making their way to the fire to grab some food.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Eat up! You look worn out," Fiona said as she shoved a sandwich into Oswald's hands, her cheeks flushed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Oswald grinned, munching contentedly while his hands wandered towards Fiona's backside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey, keep it in check!" Fiona laughed, playfully swatting his hand away, though there was no real irritation in her voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, men who had just tasted the sweetness of a woman's affection often found it hard to keep their hands to themselves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fiona, I suddenly don't want to die anymore. I think we can hold on. This way, we can be together in the future," Oswald said, his confidence bolstered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't want to die, not after just becoming a real man. He wasn't ready to let go.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fiona blushed and gave him a playful glare but remained silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fiona, why aren't you saying anything? Once we're safe, let's get married, okay?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fiona smiled but didn't say a word.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fiona, why aren't you answering? Don't you want to?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Oswald started to get anxious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kid, are you really serious about this? Marriage isn't a joke," Fiona said, her expression showing a hint of worry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Of course</span><span> I am. If we make it through this, I'll marry you," Oswald said with determination.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, Fiona's face lit up with a genuine smile. "Really? You don't have to, you know. What happened just now was my choice."</span></p><div class="pagination">
