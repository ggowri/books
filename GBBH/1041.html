  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Decker could finish his sentence, Keith landed a resounding slap across his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ow!" Decker yelped and covered his burning cheek, feeling disoriented. But before he could recover, Keith kicked him hard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Decker was aged, so he wasn't in any condition to withstand Keith's brutal assault.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He staggered backward, crying out in pain, "Please, don't... don't hit me... I'll do whatever you want! I'll give you anything!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Decker getting beaten so badly, Kiki's spirits soared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Teach that old pervert a lesson! He's a bastard!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her voluptuous body swayed as she cheered. Keith couldn't help but glance at her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You... you're a member of the Sakra Society! If you kill me, you will be punished!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Decker, now cornered, was shaking with fear, his back pressed against the wall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Punish? I'm not afraid of the Sakra Society. And even if I kill you and throw your body into the sea, who's going to find me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Keith smiled coldly, twirling the knife in his hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Please! Please don't kill me... I'm begging you..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Decker's face was pale with terror. He was retired, enjoying his golden years, and death was the last thing on his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You wanted information on 'Cyclops,' didn't you? I'll get it for you, just don't kill me. I'll do whatever you want, anything..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Decker was broken down and begged for mercy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Keith ignored him, instead turning toward Kiki. He tapped her large breasts with the sharp edge of his knife.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kiki shrieked, her face draining of color.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Keith grinned, his voice playful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry, I'd like to let you go. But I don't know if I can trust you to keep quiet about what happened today. If you talk, I'll be in trouble."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No! I won't! I won't say anything! Decker's a beast. It's better if he dies... you all saw it. He's a freak. He wanted to hurt me...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I swear. I won't tell anyone about what happened!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kiki swore fervently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, her eyes widened in sudden realization. She stared at Keith, her gaze filled with shock and a hint of excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wait! You... you're the Keith from the movies! I... I love your films! I'm a huge fan..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kiki took a few steps forward, her bare, rounded chest nearly brushing against Keith.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're my fan?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Keith was taken aback.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kiki nodded sheepishly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"When I'm lonely, I watch your movies... I know you're a rising star in Dragon Film and Television.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I really like you. Can we take a photo together?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Keith was speechless. He didn't expect that this woman, who was still tied up, naked, would ask for a selfie with him. He didn't even know how to respond.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The situation was awkward, and the room fell silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Robinson, I swear I won't tell anyone about today. Please, trust me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kiki repeated her promise, sincerity in her voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Keith, though reluctant to let her go, found himself softened by the fact that this was the first time he had met a fan in real life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His expression lingered on Kiki's face, his eyes studying her for almost a minute.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The room was still, Decker and Paula both watching eagerly to see whether Keith would show mercy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, Keith spoke.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fine, you can go. But remember, if you break your word and leak what happened today, someone else will </span><span>deal with </span><span>you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And not just you, your family, too. Got it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Keith's gaze was icy as he locked eyes with Kiki.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wasn't joking. If necessary, he could contact Alexander, and the Dragon Gang would handle things.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, yes! I won't tell anyone!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kiki nodded vigorously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Keith cut the ropes binding Kiki. As they fell to the floor, her large breasts bounced, brushing lightly against his hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The smooth, soft sensation was exquisite, and Keith swallowed hard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kiki's face turned red with shyness, clearly full of expectation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Keith shook his head. He knew that it wasn't the time to be distracted by lust. He still had to deal with Decker, and Paula was right there.</span></p><div class="pagination">
