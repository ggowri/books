  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ahem..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander coughed twice to cover up his awkwardness, then looked at Charlize and Rosalia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two women looked at him expectantly, like royal concubines awaiting the </span><span>Emperor's</span><span> favor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander suddenly felt a headache, realizing for the first time that having too many women wasn't necessarily a good thing; focusing on one meant neglecting the other.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a moment, he pointed at Rosalia and said, "From now on, Rosalia, you'll handle Ms. Blackburn's security. Charlize, you'll look after Betty. Logan and Marvin, you two focus on training the elite.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's it for today's meeting. You're all dismissed!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The men walked off, laughing and joking, ready to enjoy themselves at the bar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The three women, however, lingered, their faces filled with dissatisfaction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, Alexander spoke up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Betty, stay for a bit. We need to discuss a new cosmetic product collaboration with Ms. Thompson on a new breast enhancement line."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander said this with complete seriousness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Betty's body trembled slightly, and her disappointed face lit up with a blush of excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Charlize and Rosalia glanced at her with envy before reluctantly leaving.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inside the study, Betty asked with a complicated expression, "Boss, did you and Brittany... sleep together?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander rolled his eyes and replied, "Why are you asking? You trying to manage my business now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Betty quickly waved her hands, protesting nervously, "No, no! I was just a bit jealous and curious."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing her flustered and anxious expression, Alexander couldn't help but chuckle, giving her a playful squeeze on her ample chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The collaboration will mostly be Brittany's deal. Since she's Mr. Thompson's granddaughter, that connection will give us more leverage against the Red Umbrella Group and the Mafia."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Betty nodded firmly. "You're absolutely right, Boss. I'll follow your lead!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She hesitated for a moment, then asked shyly, "Boss, is that beauty cream really that magical? I have a few scars I want gone, and I wouldn't mind my chest being a bit... fuller..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Betty's chest was already full, but with Alexander saying the cream could remove scars, enhance her bust, and prevent sagging, she couldn't wait.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She knew Alexander liked a full figure, as did most men, so no beauty-loving woman could resist that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The atmosphere in the study turned noticeably flirtatious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Betty looked at him with seductive eyes and said softly, "Boss, why don't you help me apply the beauty cream too? Just like you did for Brittany. Please? I really want you to!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, take your clothes off."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander didn't hold back. He still had some cream left, after all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Betty didn't move, staring at him with a sultry gaze as she said coyly, "I want you to help me take it off..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander couldn't help but gulp; she was a real temptress.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Betty's low-cut top exposed a tantalizing glimpse of her cleavage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her black pencil skirt hugged her curves enticingly, and her stockings shimmered, accentuating her long legs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Betty, you're dressed very nicely today," Alexander praised.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Betty leaned into Alexander's embrace, tracing circles on his chest, her breath warm and fragrant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you like it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sight of her exposed skin sent ripples of excitement through the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course I like it. You're getting bolder now, and you've really mastered the art of seduction."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hehe, I don't care about anyone else. I only want to seduce you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Betty gave Alexander a playful pinch on the cheek.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She let Alexander pull off her top without hesitation, revealing a white half-cup bra as she thrust her chest toward him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come on, help me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander reached for the clasp on her bra and began to undo it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Betty's bra was a bit tight due to her full figure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No rush. Take it slow," she giggled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Betty laughed flirtatiously, clearly trying to tease Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the last clasp came undone, her ample chest sprang free.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander channeled his Force energy, massaging her full figure with both hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Force was profoundly mysterious, able to stimulate her nerve endings and instantly heighten Betty's sensations.</span></p><div class="pagination">
