  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alvin insisted on trying to keep Alexander there, but the latter shook his head and smiled, refusing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Don't worry," Alexander said casually. "Now that I'm the chairman of Silver Shield Security, I'll be back whenever I have the chance."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With a reassuring wave of his hand, Alexander turned to head for the car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Maxine, unable to hold back her emotions, rushed toward him and grabbed his arm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Tears filled her eyes as she pleaded softly, "Alexander, can't you stay just a few more days?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"No," Alexander replied with a gentle but firm smile. "I need to get back. My fianc&eacute;e is waiting for me at home."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The words hit Maxine like a cold gust of wind, and she took two steps back, her eyes clouded with sadness and despair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander's heart twinged with sympathy, but he remained resolute. He knew there was no future between them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Don't cry," he said softly, trying to offer comfort. "I'll visit again when I can. And you're always welcome to come to Loscity."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With that, he got into the car and sped off, leaving behind a group of stunned onlookers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As they watched the car disappear into the distance, Emma glanced at her daughter, her heart heavy with complex emotions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She wrapped her arms around Maxine, offering quiet solace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Don't cry, sweetheart. There are some things in life that we can't force. If we've had the chance to touch them, to experience them&mdash;even for just a moment&mdash;we should be thankful and content."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>By the time Alexander arrived home in Loscity, it was already late into the night.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Rosalia and Charlize, who had been keeping a watchful eye over Ava and Ashley, immediately rushed over to greet him, their faces lighting up with surprise and relief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You've worked hard," Alexander said with a smile, giving both of them a gentle pat on the shoulder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Without another word, he made his way toward Ava's room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Rosalia and Charlize exchanged a brief, disappointed glance, and then chuckled softly, understanding that it wasn't their turn to spend time with him tonight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ava's room was dimly lit, a soft, yellowish glow seeping out from under the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander paused at the door, suddenly curious about what she might be doing inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Using his Force-enhanced vision, he peered through the door, his excitement growing as he saw the scene within.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The room was in disarray, clothes scattered all over the bed and the floor. Sexy lingerie, of every color and design imaginable, was carelessly strewn about. The sight of it made his heart race.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ava, completely unaware of his gaze, was standing in front of the mirror, adjusting a flight attendant uniform.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But this wasn't just any uniform&mdash;this was a seductive, risqu&eacute; version of the traditional outfit. The skirt was short, barely covering the top of her thighs, and the top was completely open, leaving her body almost bare.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As she posed in front of the mirror, Alexander's body reacted instinctively.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He could feel the blood rushing to his head, and his thoughts became clouded with desire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He couldn't resist anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A soft knock echoed through the room, and Ava, startled, quickly assumed it was Rosalia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But when she opened the door just a crack, Alexander pushed it open, stepping inside and sweeping her up in his arms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ava let out a startled laugh, then giggled playfully. "You're a troublemaker, aren't you? Didn't even tell me you were back. Trying to scare me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Without a word, Alexander kissed her deeply, their lips meeting in an intense, long kiss that left them both breathless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ava pulled away just enough to look at him with a mischievous grin. "How do I look in this outfit? Do you like it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She twirled around, her body moving gracefully as she gave Alexander a full view. Her curves were undeniably seductive, the uniform clinging to her body in all the right places.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander couldn't help but let out a deep, appreciative sigh, fighting to keep control. His voice was hoarse as he answered, "You look incredible. Better than any real flight attendant."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He could no longer hold back the flood of desire that surged within him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Without another word, he pulled her onto the bed, his hands exploring every inch of her body, intoxicated by the sensation of her soft, smooth skin. Ava's breath hitched, and she clung to him tightly, both of them lost in the moment as the room filled with soft moans of pleasure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hours passed, and eventually, Ava lay in his arms, fast asleep, utterly exhausted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Alexander, restless, quietly slipped out of bed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He made his way to his study. Now that he was a senior Warrior, he could continue advancing his Lightsaber level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He had reached level three before, but reaching level four wouldn't be as easy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It required more materials&mdash;ten low-level energy cores, to be precise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Low-level energy cores? What exactly are those?" he wondered aloud.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Ultimate Legacy, didn't explain them in detail, and without James around to ask, Alexander was left to figure it out on his own.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>An hour passed, and his frustration deepened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He couldn't make heads or tails of it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Just then, he heard a soft rustle outside the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was Charlize, coming to check on him.</span></p><div class="pagination">
