  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, open the door and carry me in... hurry up..." Lara urged.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lara panted, urging him on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Reluctantly, Alexander released her and placed his hand on the study door handle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, he froze, his expression turning serious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shh! Quiet. There's someone inside."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lara jumped, instantly snapping out of her daze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander held her close, guiding her to the side window, pressing his ear to the wall where they could hear faint voices from inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Orion, are you sure your drug works? I slipped it into Ralph's lunch, but he's still hanging in there."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A young woman's pleasant voice rang out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lara's expression changed. Wasn't that her grandpa's maid? She couldn't believe the maid was colluding with Orion to harm him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Orion chuckled darkly, saying, "Relax, babe. As long as he takes this drug, he's done for. It's a slow-acting poison, so it's not easy to detect right away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just keep dosing him every other day, and he won't make it to the first of next month. Once he's gone, with General Flores' backing, I'll be family head for sure!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The maid laughed flirtatiously. "You are so smart. We have a deal, remember? When </span><span>you become family head, I get to be head butler, and you will give me five million dollars."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Haha, don't worry. Don&rsquo;t mention that 50 million, I'll plant a few hundred million seeds in you right now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Orion laughed triumphantly as he began pulling down his pants.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing their filthy conversation, Lara was so furious she wanted to burst in, but Alexander held her back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander leaned close to her ear and whispered, "No rush. Record a video to get evidence! Afterward, take your grandpa to the hospital for a checkup and detox, and everything will be fine."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Right! You are considerate," Lara nodded vigorously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She quickly took out her phone to record. Just as Orion stripped off his clothes, Lara's cheeks turned red, and she couldn't help glancing down at Alexander's pants instinctively.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Compared to Orion's, Alexander's size was... vastly superior.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander looked at her just then, causing Lara to shyly drop her head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Orion, don't disappoint me this time. Make it last longer than last time," the maid teased.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The maid eagerly stripped off her clothes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander and Lara silently watched the live show unfolding inside, the air thick with hormones.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The noises from the room grew louder and more shameless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lara continued filming, her face turning redder by the second, as Alexander drew closer to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She could feel his hand on her hip, but she stayed silent, biting her lip to endure it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander freely toyed with her rounded curves, losing himself in the sensation, soon finding his hands growing warm and sticky.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Alexander touched a sensitive spot, Lara's body trembled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, Orion! You're so good today. Did you eat anything?" the maid cried out excitedly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You little slut, I'm going to wear you out today!" Orion shouted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lara felt oddly stimulated, almost inserting herself into the scene as if those crude words were meant for her, and her body went limp as she fell into Alexander's arms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was nearly at his limit, but he held back, leaning close to her ear and whispering gently, "Just a little more. They'll probably talk about the poisoning again soon."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lara shivered but remained silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander held her, slipping his hand under her clothes, using every technique he knew.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lara's soft, delicate body felt like dough in his hands, as he kneaded her with abandon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With her breathing becoming heavier, Lara finally surrendered, whispering in a soft plea, "Alexander, hurry... I can't take it anymore. I promise I won't make a sound..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Alexander teasingly lingered outside, making her pout in frustration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, please... I'm begging you... stop teasing me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lara felt a mix of embarrassment and frustration as the words left her mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander felt a surge of satisfaction, holding Lara's soft curves firmly in his grasp.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lara nearly let out a gasp but quickly covered her mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It felt as if a blade of intense sensation pierced through her, from her lower abdomen up to her chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Waves of tingling pleasure and dizziness surged through Lara's body, like a shock of electricity.</span></p><div class="pagination">
