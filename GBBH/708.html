  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Rock also out of reach, everyone realized something must be wrong and that it was not going to end well.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, Yinson and Monica received urgent messages one after another.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[We failed! We were wiped out. Felix is dead, and Rock is missing...]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[Hana died in battle, and everyone else was either killed or captured!]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[We're doomed. They've started searching the island. Sooner or later, they'll catch us. Save me. I don't want to die!]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yinson, Monica, and Brandon grew upset.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yinson smashed his cell phone to the floor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Monica widened her eyes with a livid face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rock, the great elder of the City of Sorcery, was also one of her most capable lovers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now that he was missing, and no one knew whether he was dead or alive, Monica couldn't help but feel furious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brandon frowned deeply. Heinrich's strength shocked him. He had believed that, at most, the two sides could maintain a balance and that even Heinrich's side would be at a disadvantage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he never expected it to end like this!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Currently, only a few of them were aware of the news. Once it got out, the reputation of the Sakra Society and the City of Sorcery would be greatly tarnished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brandon chuckled and suddenly felt a little gloating, but the thought of how his old enemy had become so powerful worried him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, a subordinate began to summarize the intelligence and describe the details of the battle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Intelligence showed that the person who played a leading role in the decisive battle was a young man named Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's him! He's Heinrich's son!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brandon jumped up in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Monica growled through gritted teeth, "Alexander! It's him again! I will definitely get the Ancestral Witch's Cane and the Spirit Bead Bracelet back."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yinson found it hard to believe Alexander was that formidable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was able to influence the outcome of the fight between several major forces, and even Felix was killed by him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The City of Sorcery and the Mafia both suffered great losses at the hands of Alexander, more than Yinson could have imagined. He thought that even if Alexander started practicing martial arts in his mother's womb, he couldn't be so powerful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Monica slammed the desk and said angrily, "We must let him pay the price.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Brandon Hawkins, are you still not willing to join forces with us? That guy will definitely come after you. Don't think about staying out of it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She stared at Brandon fiercely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brandon chuckled sinisterly and nodded heavily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Whether it's Alexander or Heinrich, they are both my mortal enemies. I must take revenge!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I have already sent Bruno, the Mafia's ace killer, to lurk in </span><span>Loscity</span><span> and then kill Alexander."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone pondered for a while, and Yinson said expressionlessly, "Hana is a top-notch assassin in the Sakra Society. Although his strength is not as good as mine, it is not far behind. It will take at least a hundred moves for me to defeat Hana.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But he was killed by Alexander's subordinates, proving that Alexander is very strong and that his subordinates are also not to be underestimated. I am not optimistic about Bruno."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brandon took a deep puff of his cigar, blew out a smoke ring, and glanced at Monica.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although it was not the first time he had faced her, every time, he always felt a little nervous, worried that he would be attacked by her secretly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Quinn, if you don't have confidence in my ace killer, then what is your next plan? Should we endure it temporarily, or should we unite to destroy them with all our strength?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brandon wondered what Monica's opinion was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Eliminating them and occupying Treasure Island is a must! But Rock is missing, so I have to find him first.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry. Even if Alexander is a Superman, I will ruin him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Isn't his lair still in </span><span>Loscity</span><span>? I'm going to spread a plague there. I'm going to kill all his relatives, friends, and subordinates!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Monica laughed triumphantly, and her bark-like face betrayed her murderous intent, as if she were a devil from hell.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A plague!?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Brandon and Yinson were both startled, and a chill ran down their backs.&#8203;</span></p><div class="pagination">
