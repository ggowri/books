  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smiled and said, "You told me to let go."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a light flick, Janus was flung to the ground, unable to get up for a while from the pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Roman quickly questioned Alexander, "What's your problem? Why did you lay a hand on Mr. Dukes?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's expression darkened as he stared at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dukes guy was trying to be a sleaze. Were you blind just now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Roman was left speechless, his face flushing with embarrassment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ouch, ouch..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Janus groaned, finally struggling to get back up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He glared at Alexander, his expression twisting with rage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bang!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Janus kicked over a chair and shouted angrily, "Roman, what's the meaning of this? Setting me up like this? If it weren't for you begging me, I wouldn't have come. And </span><span>you still want the funds unfrozen? Dream on!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Roman quickly nodded and apologized obsequiously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Dukes, I'm really sorry. We sincerely invited you here to discuss matters, and we've even prepared a gesture of our goodwill."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He gave Avery a meaningful glance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Avery promptly pulled out a thick envelope stuffed with U.S. dollars&mdash;several tens of </span><span>thousands</span><span> dollars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Dukes, here is thirty thousand dollars as a reward for your hard work. If you can help successfully unfreeze the funds, there will be another one hundred thousand dollars as a thank you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you like beautiful women, I can arrange for some strippers at the best nightclub to ensure you have a comfortable time."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Roman held the envelope with both hands and passed it over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Janus snatched the envelope with a grim expression and said, "This money will serve as compensation for my medical expenses. As for unfreezing the funds, it's not impossible, but I have a condition."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Roman's eyes brightened, and he quickly asked, "What condition? Please just say it, Mr. Dukes. We will definitely comply!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Janus pointed at Alexander viciously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"First, this guy must bow down and apologize to me!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Second, the two beauties need to accompany me for three days. If you don't agree, then forget about unfreezing the funds."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Roman's expression suddenly turned very ugly. He hadn't expected it to turn out this way; Madelyn and Avery would definitely not accompany this scumbag.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For a moment, everyone fell silent, and the atmosphere in the private room became extremely tense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing that Madelyn hadn't said a word, Janus thought she was wavering and leaned in, not giving up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hehe, Ms. Price, come on, let's have a drink together first."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get lost!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Madelyn pushed him away forcefully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Avery was also furious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's go. I can't believe the renowned </span><span>Tijuanea</span><span> Bank would employ such a scum of a manager. I will definitely file a complaint with your superiors."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Madelyn and Avery were about to leave, Janus quickly blocked the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You think you can leave after hitting me? You can't get away; I'll call the police! If you don't want to be detained, you better listen to my orders.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Otherwise, I guarantee that the funds will remain frozen forever.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even Roman, I will have him fired!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Janus threatened arrogantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The feeling for Madelyn and the others right now was as disgusting as having eaten a fly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander shook his head; this fat guy was truly asking for trouble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Roman gritted his teeth and said seriously, "Mr. Dukes, what you are doing is illegal. </span><span>Even if you fire me, I will definitely report your misconduct to the higher-ups!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing this, Alexander nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Roman had a bit of a snobbish attitude and couldn't see the situation clearly, he still adhered to basic principles of conduct.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Janus laughed uproariously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Haha! You, a mere ordinary employee, think you can report me? Do you know who's backing me?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Roman, let me tell you, Caleb is my uncle by marriage. The only reason I could become this manager is that the president has to consider my uncle's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you have the guts, go tell the president about me; my uncle could crush you like stepping on an ant!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Janus threatened triumphantly, his fat face wearing an extremely annoying expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Roman was so angry that he clenched his fists, remaining silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Alexander asked with a smile, "Are you just going to let him bully you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Roman shot him a fierce glare and said unhappily, "Don't gloat; what can I do? People like us can only be trampled on and toyed with by the powerful."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't gloat over other people's misfortunes. What can I do? People like us are just ants that can be trampled and played with by the big guys at will."</span></p><div class="pagination">
