  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hah! Poor loser, stop trying to act impressive in front of me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mandy walked off arrogantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ella was furious and wanted to confront her, but Alexander held her back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Forget it. I'm counting on you to take care of Ashley."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Watching Ella take Ashley into the school, Alexander called Alice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, the principal, Darren, hurried over with an eager expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you the Saint Group's Chairman, Mr. Hawthorne?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander nodded, pointing to the spot where the car accident had occurred.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This area is too dangerous with the mix of cars and pedestrians. I'm donating to build a dedicated passage for the kindergarten and adding a million-dollar donation on top of that."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Darren's eyes lit up, and he nodded excitedly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you, Mr. Hawthorne! Don't worry; Ms. Hollister already instructed me not to disclose your identity."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was very pleased with Darren's attitude.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll have Ms. Hollister wire the money right now. How much will the new passage cost?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Three hundred thousand dollars should be enough!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander immediately had Alice transfer 1.3 million to the kindergarten.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing the bank transfer notification, Principal Darren was overwhelmed and looked back at Alexander with a deep sense of awe as he walked away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Who would've thought that Ashley's father was the chairman of the Saint Group?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a tremendous honor that Ashley hadn't gone to a private kindergarten but was attending his school instead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the way home, Alexander's phone kept buzzing with notifications from the kindergarten's parent chat group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He happened to see a message from Mandy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[Great news, everyone! I heard the kindergarten is building a dedicated passage. Darren always looks out for our kids!]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Several parents in the chat chimed in, flattering Darren.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mandy sent another message.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[This is an important project for the school. I think we shouldn't leave it all to them to fund. Everyone should contribute something. We're donating 50,000 and hope others will join in!]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The chat immediately fell silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Many parents silently cursed Mandy for stirring up trouble just to show off. She wanted to donate to flaunt her wealth and drag everyone else in with her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If they didn't follow suit, they'd lose face, and their kids might feel inferior in kindergarten.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing no one responding, Mandy smugly said, "Why's everyone so quiet? The kindergarten isn't just for our family; it's for all of us. Don't hold back, people!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The chat fell into an even deeper silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mandy just wanted to show off in front of the other parents, flaunting her family's wealth to elevate her child's status in the school.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[Mrs. Kelly, you're well off. Aren't you going to donate?]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[And Mrs. Sanders, your family's no less well-off than ours.]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mandy even went as far as naming a few parents directly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a while, the parents she named reluctantly replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[If everyone's donating, we'll also give 50,000.]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With someone else joining, Mandy got even more excited and directly named Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[Mr. Hawthorne? Aren't you the one who tried to shake me down this morning? Aren't you going to donate?]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander replied bluntly: [Everyone's money doesn't grow on trees. Donations are voluntary, and it's fine if someone doesn't want to contribute. You're just using guilt to coerce everyone.]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[What nonsense, Mr. Hawthorne? I'm doing this for everyone, for the kids, and you dare accuse me of guilt-tripping?]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mandy then sent a long voice message attacking Alexander, full of anger and cursing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You really are a broke loser! No wonder you tried to blackmail me this morning. Your daughter is a disgrace to our school!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's anger flared, and he felt an urge to slap some sense into this obnoxious woman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mandy taunted him further, "If you're so bold, then don't donate. Your daughter will never hold her head up here again."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander chuckled. [</span><span>So</span><span> you're saying whoever donates the most is the most important, is that it?]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course! I'm contributing to the school; what have you done?" Mandy said haughtily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[Mrs. Powell, you're going too far!] Ella messaged, jumping in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mandy scoffed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, Ms. Purnell, I know you and Mr. Hawthorne are more than just friends. I saw you two making eyes at each other at the gate this morning..."</span></p><div class="pagination">
