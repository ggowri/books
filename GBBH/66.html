  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When the killer's saber was halfway, Alexander kicked him in the crotch.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The killer gasped at the piercing pain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander kicked him right in the loins, and the killer went impotent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Bang.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The saber fell to the ground.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The killer collapsed, holding his crotch and writhing in pain like a maggot.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Are you okay?" Ava hugged Alexander and asked with concern.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander felt the plump body pressing against him and couldn't help but touch her breasts, which were bouncy and soft to the touch. He felt great.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What are you doing? Why are all the men like this? Can't you get serious?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava blushed and shook his hand off.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander chuckled. He asked Ava to get in the car and leave first without staying any longer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Under Ava's reluctant gaze, Alexander waved his hands vigorously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At the same time, he took out his cell phone and called Anne, asking her to send people to protect Ava and ensure her safety.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The killer had just caught his breath, but he was seriously injured and didn't have the strength to get up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander stepped on his chest and asked coldly, "What happened to Betty?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The killer shuddered and looked at Alexander with strange eyes. He didn't expect that Betty had something to do with this guy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Tell me, or you'll die." Alexander burst out with a fierce murderous aura.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'll tell you. Mr. Tate suspected that Betty betrayed the group and gave her to Joseph of the Cripples..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As a killer, he was very sensitive to murderous intent. He had no doubt that Alexander would kill him, so he dared not resist.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He answered honestly whatever Alexander asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Therefore, Alexander knew not only Betty's whereabouts but also Theodore's plan.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In addition to plotting to kill Alexander, Theodore planned to promote a new drug called Euphoria to seize all markets in Loscity and join forces with other organizations and big shots to go against the Saint Group.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The Saint Group didn't deal with drugs and mainly engaged in finance and medicine as well as casinos and entertainment industries.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Where is Guzman's real lair?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'm sorry, but I don't know. I don't. I was wrong... Please, please spare me. I was forced..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The killer begged again and again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander sneered contemptuously. "If it was me lying on the ground, you wouldn't say you were forced to do it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You're a killer, but you don't have the consciousness of a killer. Go to hell and apologize to those poor people you killed."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ignoring the pleading of the killer, Alexander stepped on his throat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With his current strength as a Novice, the number of subordinates he could control with the Force was limited.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Moreover, the killer was made impotent, and his resentment couldn't be easily resolved.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If Alexander didn't kill this guy, the latter would get back at him. Alexander was not a soft person.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After a while, the white flame of the Force went up and burned the dead body ferociously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">By the time several police cars came whistling over, the dead body had turned to ashes in the flame of the Force and disappeared in the wind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even the blood on the ground was burned up without leaving a trace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The police angrily questioned the witness, "You said there was a murder here and you saw the dead body. Where is the body?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The witness was dumbfounded at the sight of the clean ground without even a drop of blood.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After Alexander left, he went straight to find Betty.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He didn't expect Guzman to be so cunning as to suspect Betty.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The first thing Theodore did after arriving in Loscity was to give Betty directly to Joseph of the Cripples in exchange for an alliance between the two parties. He wouldn't give any chance to those suspected ones.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander took a taxi to the place the killer mentioned. It was a shantytown with narrow and dark streets, where thieves and drug addicts could be seen wandering around from time to time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Not far away there was a dilapidated three-story building with the number 68 hanging on the door. This was it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Stop!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When Alexander approached the building, he was immediately stopped by two burly men.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"This is not the place for you to come..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">One of the sturdy men was knocked to the ground by Alexander's punch before he could finish his words.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When the other man was about to draw his gun, Alexander hit his neck and knocked him out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander quickly entered the building and knocked out a few guards, dashing upstairs.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Betty was tied up and laid on the floor, whimpering in vain with a towel stuffed in her mouth.</p><div class="pagination">
