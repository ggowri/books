  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane playfully traced her fingers across Bowman Dillon's chest and asked, "Don't you want to get rich? There's a deal </span><span>worth billions</span><span>!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bowman nodded eagerly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Jane, billions? I've always dreamed of an opportunity like that!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a mischievous smile, Jane pinched his cheek. "If you help me with one thing, I can convince Alexander to hand over the formula for the magic powder. It's all the rage right now&mdash;worth billions, don't you think?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Really? But Jane, Alexander is your ex-husband, and you have a daughter together. Are you sure about this?" Bowman asked, his skepticism evident.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A cold gleam flashed in Jane's eyes. "Alexander has already betrayed me by getting involved with the president of the Saint Group. I never expected that."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He's refusing to let me see our daughter and has even tried to sabotage my father. I can't let this slide. I need to teach him a lesson."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bowman placed a hand on his chest, assuring her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tell me what to do, and I'll do it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I need you to kidnap Lily Beaumont. Alexander values her, and once we have her, we can negotiate for my daughter and the formula!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bowman's expression turned serious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kidnap? That's a serious crime, Jane. If I get caught, I could end up in jail... Is there another way?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane brushed his hand away and replied coldly, "You're afraid of everything. How are we supposed to make money? This is a ten-billion-dollar deal. If we don't take risks, how can we expect to get the formula?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We won't hurt Lily; we just need to keep her temporarily to pressure him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Gather a few reliable people, and just keep her for a few days. I'll contact Alexander afterward and make him give us what we want. What's he going to do?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I came to you because I trust you. Otherwise, I'd find someone else."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane turned as if to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bowman quickly grabbed her arm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Jane, let me think... This is a huge risk..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While the prospect of wealth was enticing, fear loomed over him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What if Alexander calls the police?" he asked cautiously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane huffed lightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"To achieve great things, you have to take risks. If you want to live like this forever, you can refuse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But then you'll be poor for the rest of your life, and you won't have me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Silence fell between them as Bowman considered her words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing an opening, Jane leaned closer, her demeanor softening.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She deliberately didn't wear a bra when she came out, and her plump and full breasts trembled in a charming way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Once we have the magic powder formula, we can sell it to the Red Umbrella Group. I know the chairman personally. With the money, we could go anywhere!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She reached into his pants, urging him closer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bowman couldn't wait to undress her, and her full breasts appeared in front of him, trembling with her rapid breathing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bowman, do you agree? If not, you are not allowed to touch me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane covered her breasts with her arms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She believed that Bowman would definitely agree.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because a greedy person like him could never resist the temptation of money and beauty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Human greed was the best thing that could be exploited.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bowman was already burning with desire, so he didn't care about anything else.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay! I agree. Once we have the money, we'll leave </span><span>Loscity</span><span> and live freely!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane smiled triumphantly, pushed Bowman down on the sofa, held his hand, and pressed it against her chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane smiled triumphantly, pushing him back onto the couch, a gleam of excitement in her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Jane, you're so slutty."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane guided him, moaning coquettishly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her plump breasts swayed back and forth, causing waves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane's expression was both painful and happy, and she cursed softly, "Alexander, you damn bastard, just wait and see!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
