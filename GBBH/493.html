If anything happens to your daughter, you can come to me with the Ancestral Witch's Cane and the Spirit Bead Bracelet," Rock said confidently, a hint of pride in his voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Alexander could respond, Rock hung up the phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bastard! Dare harm my daughter, I'll make sure you suffer!" Alexander exclaimed, hurling his phone to the ground, shattering it into pieces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Could it be that the Red Umbrella Group has already used the genetic serum on Ashley?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava's face paled; the news was shocking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She knew Ashley meant the world to Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get back to </span><span>Loscity</span><span> right away!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without hesitation, Alexander set off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, at the top floor of a skyscraper in downtown </span><span>Catemacola</span><span>, an elderly man with brown skin and snow-white hair set down his phone, a vicious expression crossing his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leonard sat trembling beside him, too afraid to raise his head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Guzman... Drake... and you, Leonard, are all formidable figures, not just names.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And yet, you all fell to Alexander's hands. This young man is indeed impressive!" the old man </span><span>mused,</span><span> his voice heavy with disdain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One by one, experts had been defeated by Alexander, and he had stolen the Ancestral Witch's Cane and the Spirit Bead Bracelet. The old man was unwilling to accept defeat. Alexander had to die!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With great caution, Leonard asked, "Mr. Rossetti, why reveal to Alexander that Ashley was injected with the genetic serum?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rock sneered, a wicked grin spreading across his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He picked up the dossier on Alexander from the table and flipped through a few pages.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"After years as a kept man... rising inexplicably, suddenly soaring to new heights... he must have some powerful backing!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The best plan is to let him clash with the Red Umbrella Group, ensuring they both suffer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then we can sit back and watch them fight it out. In the end, I'll not only retrieve the Ancestral Witch's Cane and the Spirit Bead Bracelet but also seize Treasure Island, making it a crucial base for our City of Sorcery."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rock explained the plan with confidence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leonard was immediately excited, his face flushed with enthusiasm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Rossetti, you're brilliant!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmph! Stop flattering me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rock glared at Leonard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That set of tarot cards was hard-earned by our City of Sorcery at a high cost. Now, it's ruined. How will you compensate?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leonard turned pale, trembling as he pleaded, "Please, Mr. Rossetti, can you reduce the compensation...?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rock replied nonchalantly, "Given your years of service to the City of Sorcery, three hundred million dollars will suffice. Not a penny less."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What! So much?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leonard fell to the ground in despair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As a fortune-teller for life, his total assets barely added up to three hundred million.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was clear that Rock had complete control over his situation. With no power to oppose the City of Sorcery, Leonard had no choice but to accept the terms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Someone will be in touch to collect the payment. Now get out of my sight; you annoy me with your uselessness!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rock waved him away dismissively.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With vacant eyes, Leonard stumbled out of the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Silence enveloped the space as Rock grabbed Alexander's dossier and ripped it into </span><span>shreds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, our City of Sorcery will not tolerate any insults. Just wait and see!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rock leaned back in his plush rocking chair, rocking slowly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A palpable aura of menace began to fill the room, chilling the air, making it almost unbearable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the drive back to </span><span>Loscity</span><span>, Alexander received a call from Betty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Boss, it's bad! Ashley suddenly started convulsing and has a high fever. I've already taken her to the hospital, but the doctors can't figure out what's wrong. You need to hurry back!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The news hit Alexander like a thunderclap, making him wish he could fly the car back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava, filled with concern, asked, "Ashley, she..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ashley is in grave danger! Rock must have been right; she's definitely been injected with the genetic enhancement serum!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
