  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Anne found herself at a loss for words.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In her estimation, Alexander, while not particularly adept in fighting, was a strategist who knew when to advance and when to retreat. Yet, today, he seemed an entirely different person.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mr. Hawthorne, you underestimate us!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">One bodyguard declared with indignation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Another snorted, "Mr. Hawthorne, our loyalty to you is unwavering, but to insult us in such a manner is unacceptable."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The other two shared in their comrades' discontent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With a smile, Alexander sought to clarify. "It seems I have failed to explain myself properly, leading to this misunderstanding. I appreciate your intentions, but your assistance is not required."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, his words, intended as comfort, were perceived as further affront by the bodyguards.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Among them, Jason Smith, the leader of the quartet, rose to address Alexander. "Mr. Hawthorne, might we have the honor of a friendly spar?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Impudence!" Anne yelled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her voice cracked like a whip as her gun aimed squarely at Jason's forehead.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Beads of sweat formed on his brow. Fear rendered him mute under the threat of her wrath.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Any disrespect towards Mr. Hawthorne will be met with swift retribution!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Anne's gaze swept over the group, and the others quickly averted their eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander was impressed. He hadn't anticipated Anne to possess such formidable skill nor such ruthlessness. In his mind, she transformed into nothing short of a tigress, fierce and unyielding.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He quickly intervened. "Let's proceed with the spar. I'll ensure it's harmless. The four of you, together."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mr. Hawthorne, your well-being is paramount, and you're injured..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Anne attempted to dissuade Alexander, but he was insistent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Together, then. No need to worry; I won't harm them."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His words ignited the fuse, and the four could no longer contain their eagerness for the challenge.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">These men were Anne's elite, always carrying themselves with a swagger born of their superior strength. Yet here they stood, outmatched and humbled by the prowess of a mere young man.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mr. Hawthorne, we shall not hold back!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jason grinned, adopting a fighting stance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His companions joined him to encircle Alexander.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander felt a surge of excitement; these opponents were true warriors who were far stronger than Ryan's men.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Thus, Alexander yearned to test their mettle against his own.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mr. Hawthorne, you won't fault us, will you?" a bodyguard inquired.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander laughed heartily. "Give it your all. If any of you can land a hit on me, I concede my defeat."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His arrogance only fueled their anger. Clearly, Alexander underestimated them far too blatantly for their liking.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the cramped confines of the room, they doubted Alexander could evade their combined assault.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mr. Hawthorne, prepare yourself!" Jason warned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He launched a massive fist towards Alexander's face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With measured restraint, he unleashed but a third of his might in the punch, intent not on harm but on humbling the audacious Alexander.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The force of the blow sent a gust towards Alexander, who stood unmoving with a smile as if frozen in fear.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Stop!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Anne cried to stop Jason, but it was too late.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jason swelled with pride and thought, "Mr. Hawthorne had brazenly thrown down the gauntlet, inviting all four to come at him at once, yet he was vanquished with my single blow."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At that moment, Alexander activated the Force, so the punch, in his eyes, slowed to a crawl.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just as the fist neared his cheek by a hair's breadth, Alexander moved.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">To onlookers, his action seemed delayed, yet he was the first to strike.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With a palm strike as swift as lightning, he hit Jason's chest.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Bang!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The two-hundred-pound Jason flew backward, crashing into the wall.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Before the others could react, Alexander dispatched them with equal ease, sending them sprawling.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Hands clasped behind his back, Alexander stood with a smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Anne was dumbfounded, her eyes wide with shock as if she had witnessed a ghost in the light of day.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She had sensed that Alexander was not what he appeared to be, yet she never imagined the depths of his concealment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Not only was he a master of strategy, but his fighting skills were beyond exceptional.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In her recollection, such prowess was unparalleled, placing him among the elite.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Anne was excited as she realized that Godfather's request to assist Alexander was not just a task but a serendipitous gift.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Moreover, despite Alexander's formidable strength, he lacked the typical arrogance of youth. Instead, he exhibited a restraint that left Anne in awe.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mr. Hawthorne truly embodies the spirit of Godfather."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Anne murmured with palpable admiration.</p><div class="pagination">
