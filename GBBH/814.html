  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Lynn said with a light smile, "Isn't it good? Do you want to try it a few more times?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"No, no, I can't take it..." Ava's eyes were dazed, and her body was limp on the bed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Suddenly, they heard applause.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"It's truly amazing; forgive me for watching it for a while." Alexander opened the door and walked in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ava and Lynn were startled by the sudden sound of a man's voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When they realized it was Alexander, they immediately felt both excited and utterly embarrassed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They encountered Alexander during the last training session; they didn't expect to run into him again now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Why... why are you back?" Ava wanted to get up but then remembered that her hands were still cuffed to the bed rail.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander chuckled, then undressed himself completely and pounced onto the bed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Lynn and Ava were pinned beneath him, being kissed and caressed, causing the desire that had just subsided to ignite fiercely within them once again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander picked up the remote control to turn it on, directly adjusted it to the maximum gear, and then grabbed Ava's chest with both hands to knead and bite hard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Poor Ava couldn't withstand such an intense skill and screamed out loud.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At the same time, Lynn pressed herself against Alexander, using her plump breasts to rub against his body forcefully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander turned to embrace Lynn, lifting her legs and pressing down directly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The next morning, Alexander had already gotten up early while they were still sleeping together in each other's arms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Last night, they were so exhausted, having made love five times with Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After Alexander changed his clothes and walked out the door, Ava finally got up groggily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander said with a smile, "I'm waiting for you. Shall we go shopping together?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Recently, Alexander had been very busy and hadn't paid much attention to Ava, so he wanted to spend more time with her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ava wanted to invite Lynn along, but Lynn wouldn't even open her eyes, muttering like a child, "I want to sleep... Don't disturb me..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander couldn't resist slapping her white, plump butt, but Lynn didn't budge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He couldn't help but laugh; it seemed that at her age, she indeed lacked the physical strength and energy of younger people.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>An hour later, Alexander and Ava held hands and walked to the nearby mall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This cafe looks nice. Let's go in and have something to eat." Ava nestled in Alexander's arms and suggested.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander immediately agreed and led her into the cafe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Wow, what fragrant coffee. It's been so long since I came here last time. The cakes are also great." Ava rubbed her hands together, as cheerful as a young girl in her first love.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander laughed out loud at how eager she was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Only in front of him would the president of Saint Group reveal such an innocent and adorable side.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They found a spot to sit down, ordered their food, and chatted happily while eating and drinking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Suddenly, they heard an extremely sharp cry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A woman sat nearby, holding a little girl in her arms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The baby girl was crying intensely, and her mother held her, trying to comfort and soothe her carefully, but the baby's cries only grew louder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Sweetie, are you hungry?" That woman quickly undid her blouse to prepare to feed the baby.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ava, seeing this, quickly covered Alexander's eyes, not allowing him to look anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Alexander quickly pulled her hand away and stared intently at the baby girl.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ava frowned in displeasure, thinking, "How can he become so lecherous now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He actually stared even at something as sacred as breastfeeding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At that moment, Ava felt a chill in her heart. She was afraid that she had truly chosen the wrong person to entrust her life to.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What are you looking at? She's feeding her baby!" Ava couldn't hold back her anger any longer; she slapped Alexander hard and glared at him fiercely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander ignored her and continued to stare intently at the breastfeeding scene.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This really pissed Ava off. If it were another man, she would have slapped him directly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After being reminded repeatedly by her, Alexander still continued to pimp as if nothing had happened, which really disappointed her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, the infant in that woman's arms started crying more intensely, flailing her limbs and writhing her body while vomiting milk in large gulps.</span></p><div class="pagination">
