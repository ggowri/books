  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Axel took a deep breath, his voice trembling as he said, "Alexander, we admit defeat. We'll leave now. Do you really want to escalate this into a fight to the death with the Vance family?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander laughed, his tone dripping with disdain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Vance family? To me, you're nothing more than ants scurrying on the ground. You think you're capable of fighting me to the death?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're digging up my mother's grave, so here's my promise: your Vance family will be bankrupt by the end of today. As for West Cemetery? It won't belong to your family anymore."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His confidence was unmistakable, radiating an aura of quiet dominance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Asher barked out a laugh, manic and mocking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, who the hell do you think you are? The Vance family is a first-class noble family in </span><span>Kingsdon</span><span>. We control real power and have assets worth tens of billions. You think a few words from you can destroy us? Keep dreaming!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Axel smirked, a sneer of sheer disdain spreading across his face. Even Gavin and the white-haired elders nearby exchanged skeptical looks, finding Alexander's confidence bordering on arrogance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sure, they were willing to back Alexander against the Vance family, but even they knew the Vance family wasn't a pushover. A fortune of tens of billions wasn't something you could erase with a snap of your fingers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava frowned, her doubts slipping into murmured words. "Does Alexander really have the means to pull this off?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Alexander remained unflinching, as calm and cold as a still lake. Glancing at his watch, he said, "It's almost time. Even if your family has a lieutenant general to lean on, he won't be able to save you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, cut the crap already!" Asher roared, his face twisting with contempt. "You think anyone here is buying this tall tale? Don't think that just because you have someone backing you, you can act invincible!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Pointing a finger at Alexander, he shouted, "West Cemetery is Vance family property now. Kneel and apologize, and maybe&mdash;just maybe&mdash;I'll consider not digging up that grave. You've got five minutes to decide!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's tone remained steady, almost indifferent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You'll hear something soon. Your family's precious ten-billion-dollar empire? Gone."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shut your damn mouth!" Asher bellowed, veins bulging in his neck. "You bastard, you're digging your own grave! Kneel now, or I'll dig up this grave myself. And if you try to stop me, I'll make sure you regret it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He grabbed a shovel, brandishing it like a weapon, his movements wild.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I said, you'll hear something soon," Alexander replied, his voice calm as ever. "Your family will crumble, and the cemetery? It won't belong to you anymore."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Enough! You're asking for it!" Asher snarled, raising the shovel high. "Fine, I'll dig it myself! Let's see if you've got the guts to kill me in front of all these people!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as the shovel was about to hit the ground, a sharp ding interrupted the tense moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who the hell is calling now?" Asher muttered, annoyed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instinctively, he pulled out his phone, glancing at the screen. His heart skipped a beat&mdash;it was Ray Vance, the financial mastermind of the family. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A call from Ray at this moment could only mean trouble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's going on, Ray? Make it quick&mdash;I'm in the middle of something," he said, irritation creeping into his voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ray's voice on the other end was frantic, almost panicked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Vance, there's a major problem! Have you seen the stock price of Vance Group?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Some big players have banded together and are shorting our stock. It's been in freefall since the market opened. We're already down 50%, and it's still dropping!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?!" Asher's voice faltered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't know who's behind this, but the major appraisal agencies have slashed our valuations to a fraction of yesterday's price. We're down to just 30% of our previous value! Something's very wrong. What's happening on your end?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Asher felt the blood drain from his face. Whispering, he asked, "Thirty percent? What about the stocks we've pledged as collateral to the banks...?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Ray could respond, another call buzzed in. Asher glanced at the screen, his expression growing even darker. It was Hudson Thurman, president of </span><span>Grandure</span><span> Bank&mdash;a call that could only mean trouble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ending the call with Ray, Asher shakily answered Hudson's.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Thurman, what's the matter?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hudson's voice was sharp, his words cutting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Vance, what's going on with Vance Group? Are you hiding bad news from us? Just look at your stock price! A storm of international financial powerhouses is hammering your stock. It's chaos&mdash;every shareholder is dumping their shares.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your share price has plummeted 60%... No, wait&mdash;it's still dropping. Hold on... it's at 70%. Now 73%... 75%! What the hell is going on over there?"</span></p><div class="pagination">
