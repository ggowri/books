  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Aunt Skyla, you'll definitely win. Don't worry, rest for a while. When you wake up, we'll be in Loscity."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Arlene comforted Skyla with sweet and melodious voice, in sharp contrast to her frosty aura.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'm not in a hurry. I need to call Malakai from the Nexura Group. I must make sure he won't supply raw materials to the Brilliant Group anymore. In that case, Alexander will have no choice but to accept my challenge!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Skyla's confidence was unshakable as she picked up her phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Valdez, if you want to save your son, you must follow my orders! Otherwise, your son won't live much longer."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At that very moment, Alexander, right in the eye of the storm, was still wrapped up in his passion with Ava, paying no mind to the troubles at hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Augusta respectfully handed a ring to Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne, this is from Godfather. Malakai from the Nexura Group is a tough one to deal with. You'll find this ring useful for your negotiation with him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Oh? Useful?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander thought for a moment before slipping the ring into Ava's hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ava had been about to ask more about the ring, but after their intimate encounter earlier, there was no time left for questions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She hurried into the car, glancing at the ring as she examined it closely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The platinum band was engraved with intricate mystical patterns, and at its center, a blue sapphire gleamed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ms. Blackburn, you've finally arrived. Mr. Valdez and his team will be here soon."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The female secretary at the company entrance sighed in relief as Ava hurried in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ava quickly adjusted her clothes and hair, preparing to meet Malakai with her most captivating, seductive, and noble demeanor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The secretary furrowed her brow, saying, "Ms. Blackburn, it seems that the Nexura Group no longer wants to cooperate with us."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With the Nexura Group's monopoly on pharmaceutical raw materials, producing magic powder would become a huge challenge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ava glanced at the ring on her left hand, feeling a surge of confidence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I hope the negotiations go well, or I fear Malakai might regret it..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The secretary said nothing, thinking that with the Nexura Group's power, making Malakai regret his decision seemed almost impossible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Here they come. Mr. Valdez is here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A moment later, someone entered the office to report.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ava immediately stood up and walked toward the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon, she saw the burly Malakai, impeccably dressed in a sharp suit, accompanied by an elegant middle-aged woman and several bodyguards.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Malakai, in his forties, wore a serious and troubled expression, his brow furrowed as if burdened with a heavy heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Valdez, please have a seat!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ava courteously gestured for him to sit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Malakai didn't respond. He merely shot Ava a cold glance before sitting down on the sofa, crossing his legs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Malakai was distant, and Ava wasn't surprised.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, if Malakai had been friendly, he wouldn't have cut off the supply of raw materials.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As they sat down, Ramona spoke first, "Ms. Blackburn, the Nexura Group will not be renewing the contract, and we will no longer supply raw materials. There's no point in discussing this further."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Malakai added expressionlessly, "Ms. Blackburn, we have our own difficulties. Therefore, we must terminate the partnership."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ava said without hesitation, "Mr. Valdez, we've had a long and successful partnership. If you're facing difficulties, feel free to tell me. Perhaps I can help."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At her words, a look of sorrow crossed the faces of Malakai and Ramona.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After a brief pause, Malakai spoke again, "Ms. Blackburn, you can't help me. From today on, our cooperation is over. We're telling you this because we have no choice. Please, don't hold it against us."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Valdez, we can talk about that. Do you really want to end things so decisively?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing that Malakai was not willing to budge, Ava's tone turned more cold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Hey, Ms. Blackburn, let's just say we've all crossed paths with the wrong people. I, too, am being forced into this. Do you think I'd walk away from money if I had a choice?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ava frowned, wondering what kind of powerful figure could force Malakai into such a corner.</span></p><div class="pagination">
