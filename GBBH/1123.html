I can do that, too."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While speaking, Alexander lifted his clothes to show Lynn his wounds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>OMG</span><span>! </span><span>How h</span><span>ave you recovered so soon?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lynn was dumbfounded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander had been stabbed three times, but the wounds </span><span>had </span><span>healed</span><span> now</span><span>, leaving only three red scars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It must have hurt a lot, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lynn </span><span>s</span><span>troke</span><span>d</span><span> the scars gently, tears welling up in her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander patted her buttocks and smiled, "Don't be sad. I'm really fine."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She chuckled, "I've told Ava that it's a date for us tonight."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay. Let's go. I haven't taken a hot spring bath in a while, and I kind of miss it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander </span><span>was happy about this arrangement</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, Lynn donned a black windbreaker to cover up her sexy body in the bikini.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the neckline still revealed her deep and charming cleavage, and Alexander couldn't help but take a few more glances.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey! I'll show you when we get there."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lynn, nestled in Alexander's arms, acted </span><span>shy</span><span>ly. Despite already being a mother, she was like a sweet little girl before him.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He took her hand and led her into the elevator.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She clung to his arm tightly with a look of satisfaction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander truly sensed Lynn's strong dependence on him and her deep affection for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had once said that he would be the last love of her life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander drove the car, and Lynn guided the way. They sped away towards the spa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She opened the car window</span><span> on the way</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>C</span><span>ool breeze</span><span>s</span><span> blew in, making her comfortable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ten minutes later,</span><span> </span><span>t</span><span>hey arrived at a lake with beautiful scenery and lush green trees.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From a distance, Alexander spotted the sign in front with a noticeable word, "spa".</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Can</span><span>'</span><span>t believe </span><span>there is geothermal energy. Although the water is artificially brought in, the energy is real."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After getting out of the car, Alexander glanced around with considerable satisfaction.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Plenty of small pools built in the spa were separated from each other, creating separate little worlds.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were also small private pools with separate courtyards or suites.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because the spa was new and unknown to many, there were few guests, and it was very quiet.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wow, how beautiful!" Lynn exclaimed. Waving her arms, she trotted over, her plump breasts quivering, leaving Alexander fascinated.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After taking off her windbreaker, she chose a larger pool, leaped in like a mermaid, and swam around quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her swinging breasts and hips were so alluring that Alexander was dumbfounded, staring at them intently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why are you still standing there? Change your clothes and come down," she </span><span>teas</span><span>ed, splashing water at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn, how dare you splash water on me! I will come down and spank you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander grew excited. Then, he removed his clothes and pants, put on his swimming trunks, and jumped into the water.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they had a water fight in the pool, Lynn's sweet giggles and his loud laughter kept echoing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a while, she was out of breath, blushing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander took his place at the side, and Lynn sat obediently beside him, nestling into his arms.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In her 40s</span><span>, Lynn had maintained herself so well that she looked only in her early 30s. She was as mature and attractive as a ripe peach, full of sweet juice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander put one hand around Lynn's waist and the other hand on her breasts, gently kneading them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She felt warm all over, and it was wonderful.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Staring at Alexander with her charming eyes, she suddenly said, "Alexander, </span><span>thank you so much</span><span>."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He asked curiously, "For what?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You take care of Ava and me. Without you, we would not be happy. Thank you for everything </span><span>you</span><span> have provided us."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lynn was so touched that a tear rolled down her eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander could not help laughing.</span><span> </span><span>If anyone should be saying thanks, it should be him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lynn</span><span> and Ava</span><span> were mother and daughter, but he was shameless enough to be with them.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Haha, y</span><span>ou're even dumber than Ava. How did I not see it before?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander grinned and pinched Lynn's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She twisted and pressed her body against him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They were close together. When he laid his hands on her breasts and caressed them, she fondled his penis from time to time.&#8203;</span></p><div class="pagination">
