  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Whether it was the decapitated body or the other unfortunate victims, their wounds were impossibly clean, like surgical cuts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosalia had struck four times, taking down over a dozen opponents.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Peter finally snapped out of his shock and roared, "Damn it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A split second later, searing pain shot through his back as blood gushed from the wound.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The combat exoskeleton had partially stopped Rosalia's blade, but it still managed to pierce Peter's flesh about half an inch deep.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Peter transformed into a raging bull, charging at Rosalia with murderous intent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His terrifying fists cut through the air like missiles, aiming straight for Rosalia's head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Attack!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The other skilled fighters jumped into action, rushing at Rosalia from different angles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfazed, Rosalia met their assault head-on. Her blade danced as she engaged multiple opponents, their movements too fast for the naked eye to follow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander watched intently, knowing full well these guys would have been dead meat without their combat exoskeletons.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The protective gear was the only thing letting them hold their ground against Rosalia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander checked the time and smirked. "Almost a minute now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The remaining gunmen didn't dare shoot at Rosalia for fear of hitting Peter. Instead, they turned their weapons toward Alexander and Charlize, fingers squeezing their triggers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The dark gun barrels erupted with muzzle flashes as hundreds of bullets rained down like a storm toward Alexander and Charlize.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Watch yourself!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander called out to Charlize before launching himself skyward, effortlessly sailing over everyone's heads and dodging the bullets with ease.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While Charlize couldn't match Alexander's graceful maneuvers, she demonstrated her extraordinary skills.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She moved with incredible speed, using trees and rocks as cover, making every bullet miss its mark.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander had now positioned himself in a tall tree several yards away, watching the battle unfold with an amused smile on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Red Umbrella Group members' faces darkened as they realized just how terrifying Alexander's jumping ability was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before they could recover from their shock, Charlize made her move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In rapid succession, she unleashed a barrage of throwing knives.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her combat suit was equipped with several knife pouches, each containing twenty blades.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The black-coated blades were laced with arrow frog poison. It was a single cut that meant certain death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Screams filled the air as gunmen fell one after another, knives buried in their throats and chests.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's cold voice cut through the chaos. "Ninety seconds have passed!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosalia's pretty face instantly darkened with rage as she shouted, "Go to hell!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two katanas, which had been moving like lightning, suddenly began to slow down, their movements becoming increasingly sedentary.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Strangely, her skilled attackers also seemed to move in slow motion, as if someone had pressed the slow-motion button on reality itself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This moment stretched like an eternity, yet paradoxically felt like the blink of an eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosalia appeared to be wielding her katanas with intense concentration, each movement precise and deliberate. Her usually rosy complexion had turned pale as snow, her expression gravely serious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's eyes lit up with recognition. Rosalia didn't possess supernatural powers &ndash; she had mastered the highest level of swordsmanship. It was the essence of authentic martial arts, where extreme speed created an illusion of slowness while being faster than ever.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Peter and his companions were also accelerating, but they couldn't match Rosalia's movements anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosalia channeled every ounce of her being into this strike, drawing admiration even from Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was the strike that marked Rosalia's true breakthrough.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Argh!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Peter, being the closest, was the first to scream.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He desperately tried to block the blade, but no matter how hard he tried, he couldn't match her speed. Rosalia's seemingly slow strike sliced across his throat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The blade found the gap in his combat exoskeleton, and Peter's head went flying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Peter's eyes were wide with terror.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Run!" the other three shouted in unison, turning to flee, but it was already too late.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosalia executed two more strikes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>These strikes appeared slow as molasses, but they had already sealed off every possible escape route.</span></p><div class="pagination">
