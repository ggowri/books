  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Asher was confident. "Grace, don't worry. I can definitely cure your grandfather."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Bring the medicine!" he commanded, waving his hand imperiously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His men quickly presented a black pillbox.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Asher opened it and revealed three green pills, emitting a faint green light and looking very attractive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Gavin Lawson, please take a seat." He asked Gavin to sit on the chair and offered him a green pill.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gavin looked at the green pill with an unpleasant expression and subconsciously looked at Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander warned loudly, "Don't eat that pill. It will kill you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Shut up!" Asher snapped, patting his chest in assurance. "Don't worry, Mr. Gavin Lawson. This is a new medicine I developed with a high-ranking expert. It will heal your injuries. If anything goes wrong, I'll take full responsibility."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander remained skeptical. "Don't take it. It will not be of any benefit in curing your injuries."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His eyes of clairvoyance could tell that there was indeed a vitality hidden in the green pill, but Gavin's injury could not be cured by simply replenishing vitality.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Additionally, replenishing vitality could disrupt the balance with old injuries, potentially causing them to flare up and create dangerous conditions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But after Asher's repeated assurances, Gavin still took the pill.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Asher then struck a pose and began massaging Gavin's back with impressive speed, drawing gasps from onlookers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Is this the legendary Enenka healing technique?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I've heard Enenka traditional medicine is magical. Mr. Vance must have a powerful mentor."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Excitement buzzed among the crowd while Grace and Lainey felt anxious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander, however, remained calm, convinced the pill wouldn't work.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Suddenly, Gavin's pale face turned rosy, and he straightened up, looking much healthier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The crowd murmured in awe, praising Asher.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ave smiled at Asher, growing fonder of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Meanwhile, Grace felt torn between wanting her grandfather to recover and fearing Asher's involvement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Asher withdrew his hands and declared, "Alright. Mr. Gavin Lawson's old injury is completely cured."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Grandpa, are you really healed?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Dad, how do you feel?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Grace and her family rushed forward and asked Gavin nervously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gavin showed a happy expression, stood up and stretched his body, then laughed happily. "I feel much better. My body is relaxed. Maybe it really worked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Asher, thank you! I didn't expect you to be so capable."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He expressed gratitude to Asher, casting a regretful glance at Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If Asher truly healed him, Gavin would honor his promise to support his granddaughter's relationship with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Grandpa, there's no need to thank me. We'll be family soon. It's what I should do," Asher replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He changed the address directly, his gaze lingering greedily on Grace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He could see that although Grace's body was hot and sexy, she still had a bit of girlish immaturity and was definitely still a virgin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Grace scoffed, feeling anxious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ave excitedly pulled Asher and kept praising him. "Asher, you're amazing! I knew I was right about you!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Unlike some people who lack skill and just talk nonsense. I suspect Alexander and Edwin colluded to mislead everyone."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her words were pointed, targeting Alexander directly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Asher arrogantly pointed at Alexander, announcing, "I've cured Mr. Gavin Lawson. Now, you should honor your promise and hand over the magic powder formula. Then get out of here and leave Loscity for good."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone turned to Alexander, eager to see his reaction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He suddenly burst into laughter, cackling as if he'd just heard the funniest joke.</span></p><div class="pagination">
