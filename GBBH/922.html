The poor cop was kidnapped. After being sent here, he was injected with several times the amount of immortality potion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The unlucky guy turned into an unprecedented monster, possessing immortality and powerful strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Monster, go to hell!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander swung the Lightsaber and slashed fiercely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Lightsaber cut off the giant's huge arm easily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The giant did not feel pain, but he was angry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stared at Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His remaining giant hand slapped towards Alexander!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The giant had as much strength as a brown bear ever had.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander raised the Lightsaber with both hands and slashed at the giant fiercely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Swish!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A light flashed, and the giant was cut in half from head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After the giant's head was destroyed, he obviously lost the ability to move and fell heavily in the corridor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander did not take the elevator, but carried Elaine up the stairs on foot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He searched every floor with his All-seeing Eyes, but found no living people or other monsters.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A raging fire had already started on the bottom floor and was spreading madly to the floors above.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Another half an hour passed, and a shrill alarm sounded in the base.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Emergency notice. The base will explode in five minutes! Please leave quickly within five minutes."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The alarm kept playing, and Alexander was relieved. Elaine had really activated the self-destruct program.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander quickly left the base, then called out to Melin and her group, who were </span><span>guarding outside, to quickly leave the area.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When they had just walked over six hundred feet away, they heard a sound behind them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then a huge ground collapse occurred. More than 300 feet in all directions became a huge crater. The base had disappeared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We're safe!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melin could no longer control her emotions.

Instead, they appeared fuller and more prominent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Several police officers looked at them with envy and then glanced at Elaine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander took out the car keys and threw them to one of the police officers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My car is over there. You drive back to </span><span>Kylaville</span><span> to find the leader of the Dragon Gang, Norma, and take Elaine with you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, Mr. Hawthorne!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They didn't dare to ask more about Melin and quickly carried Elaine towards the parking space.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone else was gone. Melin blushed and began to imagine the wonderful scene of being with Alexander in her mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It had been a long time since she last had sex with Alexander. She was excited, especially after experiencing a fierce battle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander pinched Melin's breasts and asked with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why are you blushing?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melin pouted, put her arms around Alexander's neck, and kissed his lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their tongues entangled. Alexander tasted sweetness.</span></p><div class="pagination">
