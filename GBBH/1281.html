  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Before I leave, I can protect you for a while and teach you how to spot danger, take down zombies, and deal with mutated beasts."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Me, a warrior? Is that really possible?" Sally asked, her voice trembling with a mix of fear and uncertainty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander chuckled. "You've got some serious agility when dodging zombies, and your speed is impressive. Sure, you might need to work on your strength a bit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Honestly, any ordinary person can take down regular zombies with a weapon and a little courage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Unless you're facing evolved speedsters or powerhouses, or those massive mutated beasts, you should be okay..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Alexander shared his insights, Sally gradually began to feel a spark of confidence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, you really will teach me?" she asked, her expression serious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sally was a woman who understood the importance of timing; relying on others was ultimately not a solution. Gaining her own strength was the key to survival.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry, I'll teach you," Alexander assured her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He started to show Sally some basic combat techniques and knife skills.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, a massive black figure loomed several hundred yards away, reminiscent of a primordial beast.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's eyes narrowed as he recognized what it was&mdash;a mutated bison.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This creature was enormous, dwarfing even a heavy-duty truck, with a massive head crowned by two thick, sharp horns that glinted menacingly in the light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those horns looked like they could pierce the very sky.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Its four colossal hooves were terrifyingly thick; a single kick could send a person flying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What kind of monster is that?" Sally gasped, trembling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This beast was nothing like the zombies; not even hundreds or thousands of them could take down this mutated bison.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander remained calm, watching the creature with keen interest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The bison seemed curious about them, approaching at a leisurely pace, not charging but moving steadily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't move, and don't be afraid," Alexander reassured Sally, studying the bison closely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A bold idea suddenly sparked in his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What if I could tame this bison? Riding it could let me charge through hordes of zombies!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the mutated bison drew closer, Alexander could see it more clearly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It stood taller than a person, its sleek black hide shimmering with an otherworldly glow. It felt as if even bullets would bounce off its tough exterior.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It loomed like a massive wall, exuding an intimidating presence, while Sally felt her knees weaken, paralyzed by fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the bison approached, Alexander narrowed his eyes, locking gazes with the beast.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The bison seemed equally intrigued, and they stared at each other, heavy breaths escaping its nostrils.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But as the creature inched closer, Sally, terrified, stumbled backward and accidentally knocked over a metal lunchbox, the clang echoing in the tense air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Startled, the bison's eyes turned crimson, and it lowered its head, charging at Alexander with terrifying speed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Its sharp horns resembled deadly blades, ready to impale him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Watch out!" Sally screamed in horror.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander had hoped to tame the beast, but this charge was too ferocious, as if it would bring about the end of the world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What a shame!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a resigned sigh, he sidestepped with lightning speed, swinging his sword in a fluid motion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The long-dormant Lightsaber materialized, slicing smoothly through the bison's massive head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The severed head rolled away, and the enormous body crashed to the ground, blood gushing out like a fountain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sally covered her mouth, completely stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had braced herself for a dangerous showdown, fully expecting Alexander to struggle against the mutated bison, if he even managed to defeat it at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Sally never anticipated that he would take down the terrifying beast in a single strike.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After the initial shock faded, exhilaration surged through her. Sally had always thought of Alexander as incredibly skilled; after all, he had willingly stepped up to offer her protection.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But witnessing his true power made her realize he was far beyond what she had imagined.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The bison's massive hooves twitched erratically, and its wide eyes were filled with terror, bloodshot and wild, as if the creature couldn't comprehend its own fate in that fleeting moment.</span></p><div class="pagination">
