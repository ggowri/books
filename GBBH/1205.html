  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander fixed Sienna with a final look. "Stop using your money and connections to bully people, or you'll find yourself in even bigger trouble next time."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He turned away from her with a smile, making his way toward Ava.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Christopher let out a massive sigh of relief. The tension visibly drained from his shoulders.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next day, news of the music festival incident spread like wildfire through </span><span>Loscity</span><span> and reached all the way to </span><span>Newbrook</span><span>. The story caught fire on social media, with everyone buzzing about what went down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Rhodes family's prestigious status in </span><span>Newbrook</span><span> only amplified the story's reach, turning it into the hottest topic in town.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But there was something weird about the coverage. No one mentioned who actually got Sienna arrested. Every report danced around that detail like it was radioactive. The mystery only made people more obsessed with figuring out what really happened that day.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rumors about the incident spread like wildfire across social media. Some claimed a VIP from </span><span>Kingsdon</span><span> had taught Sienna a lesson, while others suggested she had attacked the other woman out of jealousy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Rhodes family's reputation took a serious hit as wild speculation continued to circulate online.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Late that night, Alexander and Ava lay peacefully in each other's arms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava nestled against Alexander's chest, her voice soft and content. "This feels amazing... like I'm floating."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander let out a long breath. Ava was the kind of woman whose orgasms lasted both long and strong, truly the ideal bed partner for a man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It seems to be getting restless again."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava whispered with a </span><span>winking</span><span> smile as she ran her tongue over Alexander's cheek.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, she turned her back to Alexander and pushed her butt cheeks against him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Ava's body gently twisted, her soft ass rubbed against Alexander's cock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was an otherworldly feeling, and everything was so natural. Naturally, Alexander wanted nothing but to go deeper with Ava.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He held Ava's ass, and then Ava couldn't help but tilt her head back, letting out a soft </span><span>moan. She had clearly felt Alexander thrust his cock inside her pussy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava gasped and breathed heavily. All the muscles in her body tensed up involuntarily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's breath was hot against her neck, and then there was a wet tongue sliding gently behind her ears, over her back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava hummed softly and couldn't help but wiggle her hips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's hands reached forward, grabbed Ava's full breasts, and kept kneading them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava was lying on her side, so she didn't go fast enough, but she still tried her best to arch her ass back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander wasn't in a hurry either. It was like he was slowly savoring the delicacies of the earth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wanted to feel the beauty of that delicate body, to feel Ava's passionate love for </span><span>him</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was only a matter of minutes before Ava instinctively felt like she was coming. She couldn't help but speed up the backward arching of her ass and added a side-to-side rocking and rotating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh my god... I can't take it anymore... Ah!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava cried out, completely lost in the moment. Her body shook violently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her body was already limp, and in the current position, their bodies would definitely separate, but Alexander wouldn't allow that to happen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was just getting started, and he surely wasn't going to let Ava off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander flipped Ava over and pressed himself against her. "Just enjoy it, baby. I'm going to make you feel how wonderful life is."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava was still in the afterglow of the orgasm. Her body had been twitching slightly, but Alexander had already begun thrusting, and Ava had to admit, it felt really good.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She couldn't stop moaning softly, sounding very melodious. Her expression was a complicated mix&mdash;pleasure and pain intertwined on her face as conflicting emotions played across her features.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander swiftly kissed her soft lips, sucking her delicate tongue while starting to thrust rapidly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava's mind had grown hazy, her head swaying back and forth as she clung tightly to Alexander's neck, refusing to let go.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Babe, you want me to cum inside?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah. Cum inside. I want to bear your baby... Ah!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava shook her head, her hands clutched the sheets, and her feet strained again as she stomped on the bed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, Alexander raised his ass and fell down hard, thrusting his cock in the deepest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava's body trembled violently against his, drawing a deep, primal growl from Alexander's throat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Time seemed to freeze as they held each other, the world falling into perfect silence.</span></p><div class="pagination">
