  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beverly felt a surge of excitement, convinced the plan would work. "Alright, let's do it. We'll launch a surprise attack tomorrow night and take out the Axe! Alyssa's been way too cocky lately. She won't see this coming."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paxton nodded eagerly. "Now that we're allies, how about we celebrate together?" He reached out with a suggestive grin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beverly rolled her eyes playfully but didn't resist. "Why are men always so driven by desire?" she teased as Paxton pulled her onto the bed, their passion quickly reigniting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next morning, Alexander finished his meditation, feeling energized. He had spent hours with Alyssa and Alice the night before, and his Force had grown stronger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Outside the villa, Alyssa was watching an intense scene unfold. Alice, dressed in tight athletic wear, was sparring with several large men from the Axe. As Alexander's secretary and bodyguard, she was skilled in martial arts and had proven herself time and again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite facing four strong opponents, Alice moved with precision and confidence. Her strikes were swift and effective, leaving her opponents struggling to keep up. The men were hesitant to use full force against her, which only gave Alice the upper hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sparring was fierce, and Alyssa watched with admiration. Though she was a capable fighter, she knew she couldn't match Alice's expertise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander observed with interest. Suddenly, Alice exploited a weakness in one of the men, causing him to fall and trip another. She quickly kicked both of them in the chest, rendering them temporarily incapacitated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Nice work!" Alexander cheered, impressed by Alice's timing and technique.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The remaining two men hesitated, and Alice soon found their vulnerabilities, knocking them down in a few swift moves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wow, that was amazing!" Alyssa and the onlookers applauded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alice, those kicks were incredible. You're the best fighter I've ever seen," Alyssa praised, handing Alice a towel with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alice blushed, glancing at Alexander. "You're too kind. I'm nowhere near as skilled as Mr. Hawthorne. He's the true warrior."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alyssa, intrigued by Alexander's abilities, asked, "Could we spar without anyone getting hurt?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He chuckled. "Sure, but you might need some help. Why not gather a few more people to join you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Great idea! I want to see what you're capable of today," Alyssa said enthusiastically, knowing she couldn't win alone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She turned to the crowd. "Let's see... Five&mdash;no, ten of you, come join me against Mr. Hawthorne!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander shook his head. "That's not enough. Ten won't do."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alyssa was taken aback. "Ten people aren't enough? How many do you need? Do you dare take on everyone here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd, numbering at least fifty or sixty, buzzed with excitement. Despite his reputation, they thought sheer numbers would overwhelm him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alyssa began to regret the challenge. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Man cared deeply about their dignity. She should have </span><span>leave</span><span> some room for him to win.</span></p><div class="pagination">
