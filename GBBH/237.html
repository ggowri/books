  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She sat close to Alexander, her thigh brushing against his. The scent of her perfume filled the air, instantly igniting Alexander's desire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alice, are you spying on me? How do you know about these things?" Alexander asked, displeased.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne, you don't have to worry about me. I won't compete with Ms. Blackburn for your favor. I just want to be by your side because my fate is tied to yours. If you could take pity on me and let me have a child, so I won't end up alone, I would be content."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alice's helpless words touched Alexander deeply.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander frowned, "Why do you insist on being with me? You could get married and find your own happiness."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alice smiled faintly, "Mr. Hawthorne, I'm your secretary. I know everything you do. Perhaps you might set me free, but the Godfather won't. For people like us, the best outcome is to stay by </span><span>the your</span><span> side and get even a little bit of your favor."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was silent, at a loss for words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alice was right. She was different from the others because she knew too much. Even if Alexander was willing to grant her freedom, the Godfather wouldn't let her go.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alice smiled, "The boat has been rocking for so long. I have a headache and my body aches. Mr. Hawthorne, could you rub me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She fell into Alexander's arms willingly, hugging him close.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne, please rub me!" Alice pleaded coquettishly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander immediately felt the wonderful touch of her plump body, soft and elastic, incredibly tempting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Rub me, please!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alice grabbed Alexander's hand and pressed it against her chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's mind went blank. All he felt was the round and full sensation in his palm, too much for one hand to hold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He no longer resisted and began to massage her gently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, Alexander activated the Force. Threads of the Force merged into her, causing Alice to let out a comfortable gasp.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It feels so good!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She felt a strange energy transferring from Alexander's palms to her body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As this energy spread throughout her body, she felt warm. The soreness and fatigue slowly disappeared, replaced by a deep sense of pleasure and comfort.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The mysterious energy grew stronger, and she felt her body becoming light and floaty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She frowned in comfort, her pretty face showing an expression of enjoyment, her moist, large eyes filled with urgency and anticipation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander continued to massage Alice calmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alice's skills were on par with Charlize, a true heroine among women.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Due to regular exercise, her body was fit, with a plump chest and a firm butt, sexy and charming.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her physical fitness even surpassed most men, making her nerves highly developed and sensitive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's massage alone left her limp and powerless, her face flushed. She panted heavily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gradually, Alexander felt desires swelling and rising within him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alice's smooth and delicate skin and her perfect figure ignited the lust deep within him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander could no longer endure. He ripped off her towel and pressed down on her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The atmosphere in the room heated up, with faint moans echoing...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>More than an hour later, the room fell silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm going to take a bath."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander went into the bathroom to cool off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With more and more women around him, his emotions were complicated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alice had no strength left. She was still dazed, lost in the afterglow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander came out of the bathroom and suddenly noticed tears in Alice's eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Alexander, she quickly wiped her tears and covered her head with the blanket, her body trembling uncontrollably.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was puzzled, thinking, "You were the one who initiated it. Why are you crying?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's wrong? Are you feeling unwell?" he asked with concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alice cried and threw herself into Alexander's arms, hugging him tightly.</span></p><div class="pagination">
