  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Clay not only didn't leave </span><span>Kingsdon</span><span>, but he also wants to propose to me at my house. A man of his word should keep his promises. I helped you save your daughter, but you haven't fulfilled your end of the bargain." Nancy sulked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clay had indeed pushed her to the brink.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her grandfather and parents were pressuring her to marry him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were eager to form an alliance with the City of Sorcery, which would greatly benefit the Kaylon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy had no choice but to seek Alexander's help.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander replied, "Last time, Clay escaped, but I will definitely help you this time."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, as long as you keep your promise," Nancy sighed in relief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She stood up and closed the door. Then she walked over to Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't help but swallow hard. Nancy was dressed in a pink spaghetti-strap top, her collarbones exposed. Her cleavage was alluring.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her skirt was short, revealing her long, slender legs in all their glory.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her skin was flawless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do I look good?" Nancy asked, leaning down to wrap her arms around Alexander's neck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her breasts hung slightly, appearing even fuller and more enticing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander felt a surge of desire, but he suppressed it and asked, "Have you fallen for me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy snorted, glancing at Alexander's crotch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She asked, "Have you been with other women?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander chuckled, "Does it matter if I have? The key is what you want to do."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy glared at him. "No, I just want to check you out."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was speechless. "Why do you want to check me out? I never said I only had one woman, and how do you plan to check?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy shook her head. "I don't care. I must check you out. If you've been with other women, there will be a scent on you. I read about it online."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy was determined, having done her research.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander couldn't help but laugh. This woman, after tasting the pleasure once, was now eager for more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fine, you can check, smell, lick, and taste it," Alexander teased.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Pfft. You have a dirty mind. Who would taste that thing?" Nancy retorted, clinging to Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her ample breasts pressed against him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's bulge grew even more prominent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't move." Nancy reached for Alexander's pants.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the zipper was pulled down, his manhood popped out and hit her cheek.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is ridiculous!" Nancy exclaimed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She then pretended to be calm and began her inspection.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander sighed, "If you want to take advantage, just say so. Go lie down on the bed."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy's cheeks flushed red, and she said bashfully, "Why are you in such a hurry? The more you rush, the more it shows you have something to hide."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She then held it with one hand and gently stroked it with the other.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is this where you pee?" she asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander grinned. "Try it and find out."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What, are you scared?" Nancy looked at him mischievously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fine, check however you want, I don't care," Alexander said, deliberately thrusting it forward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He almost pushed it into her mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't move, or I'll pull it out." Nancy gripped it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander found it pleasurable and closed his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy leaned in to sniff at it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The scent wasn't pleasant, but it wasn't unbearable either.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She suddenly laughed. "You haven't been up to any good."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was annoyed. "I think you're just here to take advantage of me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why would I take advantage of you?" Nancy blushed and spat at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander lifted her chin. "Then what are you doing now?"</span></p><div class="pagination">
