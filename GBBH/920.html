  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The wind was howling!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The colonel dared to confront Alexander head-on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smiled in disdain. The colonel was arrogant and conceited.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The opponent was about to hit Alexander in the chest. If Alexander didn't dodge, his ribs would definitely be broken.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Alexander was faster. He reached the side of the colonel's body like lightning and grabbed his right wrist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The colonel's wrist was broken, and he screamed in pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, Alexander punched him in the stomach. The colonel fell to the ground, holding his stomach, and curled up in pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it. I'll kill you..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The colonel had a ferocious expression. He took out a potion from his pocket and injected it directly into his body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The black liquid quickly entered the colonel's body. It was the first generation of immortality potion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was a little surprised. He didn't expect that the colonel was so fearless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The generation of immortality potion had serious side effects. If a normal person used it, he would at least be the living dead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But for a short period of time, he was immortal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The colonel had broken one of his hands, but after being injected with medicine, he seemed to be fine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes turned red, and he laughed wildly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You want to kill me? I am immortal. You are the one who is going to die, and I will </span><span>live forever until the day the world is destroyed!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The colonel grinned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His broken hand was twisted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing the colonel's strange changes, Alexander did not take action immediately. He wanted to see how this guy turned into a living dead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The colonel had lost his sense of pain and his mind, roaring like a wild beast.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Alexander was observing, the colonel pounced on him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His nails had grown long and sharp, and had turned black, obviously poisonous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander casually blocked the colonel with his assault rifle, but the gun body was actually cut off by the colonel's nails.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was a white light. Alexander finally took out the Lightsaber.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The colonel felt his hands tremble and discovered that all of his fingers were gone, cut off by the Lightsaber.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The colonel, who had already begun to transform into a living dead, was not afraid at all. With red eyes, he pounced on Alexander again and opened his mouth wide to bite Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was obvious that the colonel had lost his sense of pain. Otherwise, he would lose his ability to fight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, he had lost his normal thinking and become crazy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander sneered and stabbed with the Lightsaber.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His movements were graceful and elegant, like a noble performing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone, who saw this scene, felt that Alexander's movements had a strange beauty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The colonel's two hands were cut off and fell to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The blood flowing from his wound was no longer red, but black.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's Lightsaber stabbed the colonel in the heart, leaving a hole in his left chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the colonel did not feel any pain. He just took a few steps back and continued to charge towards Alexander with a ferocious laugh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Immortality? It's just a monster!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander snorted coldly, shook the Lightsaber in his hand lightly, and a powerful force burst out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The colonel's chest was hit hard by the Force, and a big hole was blown out in his chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Half of his body disappeared, turning into debris, wriggling in the black blood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The colonel still didn't fall down, staggered, and roared madly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander didn't kill him because he wanted to see how strong the living dead was. Now, it was time to end it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The colonel's head was cut off and flew out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The headless corpse immediately stopped moving and fell to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The colonel was killed, and his soldiers lost their fighting spirit. Under the fierce attack of Melin and others, they fled in panic.</span></p><div class="pagination">
