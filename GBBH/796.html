  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Betty's expression was anxious, shy, and coquettish, which could definitely arouse a man's violent tendencies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander pressed on her without hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The office was filled with seductive moans, as well as the sounds coming from their joined parts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After more than an hour, Alexander felt he could no longer bear it and slapped Betty's butt hard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Betty yelled, "Hit me. Keep hitting me. I'm going to die. I'm going to die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She screamed and cried, twisted her waist, and raised her plump buttocks towards Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With the last high-pitched sound, Betty arched her body desperately, and then her whole body collapsed. She fell completely unconscious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>By the time Alexander and Betty finished cleaning themselves and walked out of the office, two hours had passed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Lamont looked at Alexander with shock and admiration as if he was looking at an idol. Which man could last that long?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander was in high spirits and felt relaxed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Betty was exhausted and leaned lazily on Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Just as the two were about to leave, they saw several black cars speeding towards them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander said in surprise, "Todd is here again. He brought a woman with him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Several cars stopped in front of Alexander. Then, more than a dozen burly men rushed out of the cars and surrounded Alexander in an arc.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Zora, it's this guy. He is Alexander!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Todd yelled at Alexander in anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Stop barking!" replied Alexander coldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You! How dare you call me a dog?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Todd was so angry that he was speechless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Zora Jared, the woman standing next to him, narrowed her eyes, anger evident in her gaze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Alexander, my cousin is here. Do you dare to hit me now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Todd rushed to Alexander, roaring with spit flying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With the support of his cousin from the Dragon Gang, he completely forgot about being beaten by Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"A mad dog dares to harass me! Damn it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander directly slapped Todd hard in the face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With a scream, Todd flew fifteen feet away and fell into the roadside sewer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Suddenly, Todd's head and face were covered with filth, and it smelled terrible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Help! Help me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Todd's cry for help woke up the stunned crowd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Several men hurriedly pulled him out of the sewer in disgust.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Poor Todd had a dull look in his eyes. His face was covered with mud, feces, and urine. He just collapsed on the ground with a look of despair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Zora kicked him hard and said angrily, "You are a man of the Jared family, but you are so useless! Get out of here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander looked at her with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Are you Todd's cousin, the leader of the Dragon Gang? Why didn't you stay in Risun but came to Loscity?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Zora sneered, "I, Zora Jared, can come to Loscity whenever I want. Is Loscity your private property, Alexander?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"But I didn't expect you to be so arrogant. You even dare to bully Todd!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As Zora spoke, she walked up to Alexander stylishly and looked him up and down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander said seriously, "I didn't bully anyone. I just beat up a mad dog. A mad dog barked in front of me, so I must teach it a lesson."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Zora couldn't refute it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Good, Alexander. I've heard that you are good at making excuses. Today, I finally understand. Todd is the director of the Loscity Revenue Service. Why didn't you pay the taxes when he asked you to?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Zora glared at Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander sneered, "This is Loscity, not the Risun, and certainly not the Dragon Gang. I advise you to get out of here quickly. Otherwise, you have to take the consequence!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Just as he finished speaking, Lamont, behind him, suddenly waved his hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dozens of security personnel in uniform rushed out of the factory aggressively, drawing their guns and pointing them directly at Zora and her men.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Zora looked at the dozens of gun muzzles, feeling their momentum, and dared not say a word.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If she kept talking nonsense, they would really shoot and kill her!</span></p><div class="pagination">
