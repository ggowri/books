  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How dare you, an evildoer, act so presumptuously!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander walked towards Patrick with an imposing manner.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One step!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Two steps!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Three steps!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Alexander approached, Patrick felt as if he was being pressed down by a mountain and was unable to raise his head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What do you want to do?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Patrick's lips turned pale, and he kept backing away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come on. I'll let you make the first move!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was calm. He did not take Patrick seriously at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What! You want me to attack first? Alexander, you are too contemptuous of me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Patrick felt humiliated and angry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clay suffered a great loss, so Patrick did not dare to be careless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Patrick stared at Alexander's head and shoulders.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Patrick's alert look, Alexander thought that Patrick really had some skills.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before a person made a movement, his head and shoulders would have slight tremors, which served as a warning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Different from Patrick who was nervous, Alexander was unusually composed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was silence. And everyone stared at the two intently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this time, black gas appeared on Patrick's body and quickly spread throughout his body, looking very strange.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He grinned, "Alexander, it's not a big deal for you to let me attack first. If you have the guts, let me make ten moves. I promise to kill you within ten moves!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander waved indifferently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said, "Okay, I agree! Come on. Stop wasting time and show me how powerful you are."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Humph! You are doomed."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Patrick sneered and stomped his foot hard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The floor broke into pieces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Patrick flew up instantly, like a cannonball, and slammed his head into Alexander with violence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His body was invulnerable to swords and spears. Patrick had absolute confidence in his ability to smash even a rock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone felt that a compelling aura suddenly burst out from Patrick!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Alexander didn't move at all, as if he was frightened and stood there motionless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Patrick hit Alexander with his head, Alexander's hands and feet would definitely be broken.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just when Patrick thought that Alexander couldn't escape, Alexander suddenly disappeared, as if Patrick just had an illusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, Patrick felt a sharp pain at the back of his neck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Patrick's face changed instantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Alexander had not agreed to let him have ten moves, Patrick would have been hit in the neck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Patrick had confidence, he still did not dare to let Alexander hit him easily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is the first move. Keep going!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander urged coldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Patrick said, "Don't be arrogant!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Patrick was furious. Forced into this situation, he had to either accept his fate and wait for death, or kill the enemy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He spread out his ten fingers. And his ten sharp black nails, which were as long as his palm, aimed at Alexander's throat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Patrick was lightning fast.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had poison on his fingernails. If they scratched Alexander's skin, he would be poisoned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"An old man grow his nails so long. Gross!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander sneered and suddenly disappeared like a ghost.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Patrick's attack missed. His terrifying nails tore through the air, emitting bursts of pungent fishy smells. The poison on his nails was too fierce.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The people around frowned and quickly stepped back a distance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The second move!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was relaxed, as if he was playing a game.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Patrick had a serious expression. And he just wanted to kill Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Alexander didn't die today, all of them would be in danger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Patrick roared, rushed towards Alexander again, and launched a fierce attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The third move! The fourth move! The fifth move..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, Patrick's attacks had exceeded ten moves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander never fought back and perfectly avoided Patrick's attacks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Go to hell!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The black nails aimed at Alexander's eyes again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Faced with Patrick's fierce attack, Alexander finally stopped dodging and threw a seemingly simple punch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You are asking for death!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing this, Clay exclaimed with joy.</span></p><div class="pagination">
