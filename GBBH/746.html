  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was nowhere to hide inside, and he was practically in despair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What should I do? What should I do now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blaze was so anxious that he was pacing around in circles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Three sides were solid walls; only the toll window and the main gate led outside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now that Melin was blocking the door, there was no way for him to run.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And Melin was still banging on the door and shouting, which would soon attract more people.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Blaze felt his head swelling and his heart rate increasing, feeling as if </span><span>Melin was out to get his life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn that woman! She's trying to kill me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blaze cursed fiercely, as if he were an evil spirit from hell, with a terribly grim and fearsome expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The person inside, open the door now, or I'll call more people over!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melin had lost her patience and was about to call for backup through the communicator.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing this, Blaze knew he could no longer wait.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He steeled himself, pulled out the prepared syringe of anesthetic he had hidden behind his back, and grabbed the doorknob to open it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's me. Ms. Hale asked me to keep an eye here so that the money wouldn't get stolen."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blaze put on a cheerful smile, trying his best to appear completely at ease.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Blaze?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melin was very surprised, then she looked at him up and down. He had sweat all over his forehead, and it was clear that his expression was still somewhat panicked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why did Ms. Hale ask you to be the guard? Why not hire a security guard or one of us? Tell me, what exactly were you doing there?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melin was not so easily deceived; she immediately noticed Blaze's unusual behavior.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, you've misunderstood me. If you don't believe me, contact Ms. Hale right now and ask if she was the one who asked me to guard here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blaze pretended to be very angry, and his expression was uglier than crying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You didn't lie to me?" Melin frowned, then took out her phone to call Eddy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before the call could connect, Blaze pounced like a vicious wolf, and forcefully jabbed a syringe filled with anesthetic into Melin's arm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The anesthetic from the syringe was fully injected into Melin's body!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melin quickly pushed Blaze away, but it was already too late.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, the door behind Blaze swung wide open, and Melin saw the chaotic scene inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the floor were two large suitcases stuffed with cash, and several cabinets were left open, with bills scattered all over the place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Blaze, how dare you come here to steal money!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melin, enraged, raised her gun to shoot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blaze's heart rate quickened, and his adrenaline surged as he forcefully grabbed Melin's arm and twisted it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melin's gun fell to the ground, and before she could resist, everything went black in front of her, and her body became increasingly heavy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing the anesthetic had taken effect, Blaze became even more sinister.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "Since I've already been discovered, I might as well take advantage of the situation and fuck Melin. That would be so satisfying. She caused herself to end up like this anyway."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Slut, you must have come here on purpose for me to sleep with you, right? Hahaha!" Blaze smirked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He grabbed Melin's arm and forcibly dragged her into the payment area.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Melin couldn't gather the strength, she had not completely lost consciousness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She struggled with all her might, tightly gripping the edge of the nearby table, and rebuked, "Blaze, this is theft and assaulting a police officer. Do you want to spend your life in prison?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Do y</span><span>ou still want to send me to jail? When I get tired of fucking, I'll kill you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blaze had already become insane, looking as fierce as a devil.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just let me take some money, but you dared to ruin my plan... Let go now, come in obediently. Let me have some fun. Maybe I'll spare your life."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm telling you, I'm the one who made Jeff disappear. Haha, I injected him with blood from a plague patient and sent him to Risun for human experimentation."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blaze, while boasting, pulled Melin forcefully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melin's vision had gone completely dark, and her mind was becoming increasingly muddled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she gritted her teeth and held onto the railing tightly, refusing to let go.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is murder! I will definitely catch you and make sure you face the justice of the law!" she said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You want to punish me? Stupid woman, just wait and see how I'll deal with you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blaze laughed lewdly, planning to rape Melin, then take more money and flee the country to live a carefree life abroad.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anyway, Loscity was now severely weakened, with a shortage of personnel everywhere. As long as he was cautious enough, there would definitely be no problem.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Help!" Melin started to cry for help, but even her voice was weak and feeble.</span></p><div class="pagination">
