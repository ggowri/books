  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before, they were wary of Yvonne because she had gathered a group of people.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But now, Yvonne had betrayed the City of Sorcery. If they could capture her, they could not only have their way with her but also show their loyalty to Monica and Rock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yvonne felt a little scared facing so many enemies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But then she touched the amulet around her neck and felt confident again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This amulet was a gift from Alexander, made from high-level gems. It could resist witchcraft attacks for a certain time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander also gave her a power elixir to unlock her potential. It was an improved Level 2 power elixir.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yvonne was lucky to gain Level 2 speed power. Her speed was now as good as an expert.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yvonne was already devoted to Alexander. After receiving his help, she was even more loyal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A fat wizard stepped forward and pointed at Yvonne. "You traitor, kneel and die."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"How dare you insult me?" Yvonne glared at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Suddenly, she moved so fast that she disappeared from where she was standing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone was shocked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even Monica and Rock were surprised.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They both knew Yvonne well. Before, she was a wizard, but her speed was never this fast.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yvonne appeared in front of the fat wizard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The fat wizard wanted to run, but it was too late.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She struck him with her palm. A poisoned needle pierced his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The fat wizard screamed in pain. A black spot appeared on his face and quickly spread.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon, his whole face turned black, and the blackness spread to the rest of his body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He fell to the ground, foaming at the mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His body convulsed a few times, and soon he stopped moving.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His body started to rot, and a foul smell filled the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Most people were still in shock. A dark wizard had been killed by Yvonne without any resistance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yvonne's speed, combined with her witchcraft, made her very dangerous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>People who knew her power couldn't believe how fast she had become.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The temple was silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The wizards who wanted to attack Yvonne stepped back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yvonne was excited.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With her speed power and witchcraft, her power had more than doubled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This was all thanks to Alexander. She admired him more than ever.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If she could defeat Monica, she could become the ruler of the City of Sorcery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She looked around and said, "Who else is not convinced? Step forward."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>No one said a word.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Monica barked, "Yvonne, you will die."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yvonne spat at her, "You are all trash compared to my master."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With Alexander's support, she was confident even when facing Monica.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She raised her hands, and blue poisoned needles appeared in her palms. She pointed them at Monica.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Facing Monica's power, Yvonne didn't back down. Instead, she was ready to fight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Come on, old woman. You are not worthy to fight my master. I'm standing right here. Do you dare to fight me?" she said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yvonne's red robe fluttered in the wind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The master she mentioned must be Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone was shocked, wondering what made Yvonne willing to be Alexander's servant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And she was bold enough to cause trouble at the celebration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even presidents, royalty, and noble families wouldn't dare to disrespect the City of Sorcery and Monica like this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But everyone had to admit that Yvonne's power, shown by her quick kill of the dark wizard, was not to be underestimated.</span></p><div class="pagination">
