  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The kitchen staff and helpers were muttering to themselves, and their faces were a mix of disbelief and awe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dulles tried to say something, but his mouth just hung open, practically drooling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Something deep inside him was screaming to get a taste of that </span><span>spaghetti</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Holy crap, Alexander's incredible! That spaghetti must be out of this world!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah! Who knew he could cook like this? I'm honestly blown away!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cloe, William, and Logan couldn't contain their excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander divided the spaghetti into smaller portions, gesturing for Dulles to try some.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone's eyes were glued to the spaghetti, not daring to blink.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, I can't wait anymore. Can I please get first dibs?" William bounced on his feet, and his patience was completely shot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The others crowded around, and their eyes practically sparkled with anticipation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hold up! I'm testing it first</span><span>&mdash;</span><span>everyone backs off!" Dulles lunged forward, </span><span>scaring</span><span> </span><span>someone might snatch his portion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Chill out, guys! There's enough for everyone!" Alexander laughed, throwing up a Force barrier to keep the eager crowd at bay.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he started portioning out the pasta, the kitchen fell dead silent. Everyone watched him like hawks, swallowing hard as their mouths watered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When they finally got their plates, the incredible aroma hit them like a wave. They were completely mesmerized, lost in the moment, as the smell alone had them under its spell.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone fell silent as they began to taste the spaghetti.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dulles, with his royal chef heritage, approached the dish with the kind of reverence only a true food connoisseur could muster.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When the spaghetti touched his tongue, his eyes went wide, and he couldn't suppress a small shudder. His face was a picture of pure amazement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Holy crap, this is incredible! It's perfect!" he thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How could a simple plate of spaghetti taste this phenomenal? The pasta, the tomatoes, the meat sauce</span><span>&mdash;</span><span>everything was in perfect harmony, creating an explosion of flavors he'd never experienced before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But there was something else too. Each bite seemed to carry some kind of magical energy, spreading warmth throughout his body. It felt like sitting in gentle sunlight or soaking in a hot spring.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dulles felt his spirits lifting, almost like he was floating on air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What was happening?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was beyond anything he'd ever tasted. The thought of never eating spaghetti this good again made his heart sink.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Will I ever get to eat spaghetti this perfect again?" Dulles asked Alexander, sounding like a kid who'd just discovered their favorite thing in the world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander just smiled knowingly. He wasn't about to tell Dulles that he'd infused the Force into the spaghetti while cooking it</span><span>&mdash;</span><span>that was what gave it those energy-boosting, healing properties.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dulles didn't waste another second. He devoured the rest of the pasta like it was his last meal, making sure to get every last drop of sauce. By the end, he couldn't help himself</span><span>&mdash;</span><span>he literally licked the plate clean.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And it wasn't just him</span><span>&mdash;</span><span>all the other chefs and kitchen staff, including William and Logan, were exactly the same way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only Cloe tried to keep up appearances in front of Alexander, acting a bit shy, but even she couldn't stop gushing about how good it was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>William wolfed down his spaghetti in record time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't just focus on his own plate either</span><span>&mdash;</span><span>his eyes kept darting to everyone else's portions with such naked longing as if he hadn't eaten in days.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cloe's cheeks were flushed pink, giving her a natural glow that no makeup could match.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The spaghetti was still a bit hot, so she gently blew on it before taking each bite, savoring it with pure bliss written all over her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Growing up in the Bryant family, she'd been spoiled with luxury</span><span>&mdash;</span><span>she'd eaten at all the finest restaurants and tried every delicacy imaginable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Alexander's simple plate of spaghetti had her completely hooked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she ate, Cloe felt lighter, like all her exhaustion just melted away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, this is incredible! Hands down the best thing I've ever eaten."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Here, take the rest," Alexander said with a smile, contentedly watching as she dug in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone else had finished their portions and could only watch Cloe eat with barely concealed envy. Their hearts broke a little as she enjoyed those last precious bites.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dulles couldn't stop licking his plate clean, and his eyes were glued to Cloe's spaghetti with an almost desperate hunger.</span></p><div class="pagination">
