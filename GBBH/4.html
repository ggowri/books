  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Outside the hospital, a black Rolls-Royce was parked along the roadside.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As soon as Alexander stepped out of the building, someone inside the car locked eyes on him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was a stunningly beautiful young woman with an air of elegance and nobility. She frowned as she watched Alexander.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"So, he's the fianc&eacute; the Godfather chose for me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She studied Alexander, perplexed by how ordinary this man seemed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her secretary, Emma Atwood, was visibly displeased.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Ms. Blackburn, could the Godfather have made a mistake? You are the CEO of the Saint Group, overseeing a fortune worth billions dollars.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"And this new chairman, what is he even thinking? Hosting a ball to select a vice president? It's completely ridiculous!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You're the CEO, and yet they didn't even consult you about something this important. They just had Anne issue the orders, totally disrespecting your authority."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava shot a sharp glare at Emma.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It's not your place to question what the Godfather or the new chairman decides.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Don't alert Alexander. Follow him and see where he's going."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At that moment, Alexander started driving away in his modest Toyota.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Half an hour later, he parked in front of an old nursing home and walked inside, clearly familiar with the place.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava murmured to herself, "The fact that he's coming here to volunteer shows he has a kind heart."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Emma quickly chimed in, "Ms. Blackburn, we don't have time to waste. The mayor and several business elites are waiting to meet you to discuss the vice president selection."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava replied coldly, "Can't you see I'm busy right now?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Emma flinched, surprised, and stammered, "Ms. Blackburn, you're not seriously considering this man as your fianc&eacute;, are you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A flash of anger crossed Ava's eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If the Godfather heard what you just said, do you know what would happen?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Emma's face turned ashen, and she slapped herself hard across the face twice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'm sorry! I was wrong! Please forgive me, Ms. Blackburn."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava's icy stare bored into her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Remember your place. The Godfather's decisions are not to be defied. And as for what I choose to do, you have no right to interfere."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her voice still cold, Ava suddenly clutched her chest, wincing in pain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Ms. Blackburn, please don't get upset! It's my fault."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Emma immediately pulled out Ava's prescribed medication for angina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava waved her off, her expression indifferent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"From now on, be quiet and wait!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Meanwhile, Alexander reached the end of a hallway and stood in front of a black wooden door.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He gently pushed it open and called out, "Mr. Rutherford, are you okay? I'm sorry I haven't visited lately. A lot has been happening."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The room was gothic in style, with scattered black pills on the floor and shards of broken glass.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A musty, decaying odor filled the air, and Alexander couldn't help but wrinkle his nose. He knew that James Rutherford's old injuries were worsening.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Alexander, you finally came!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A joyful voice rang out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mr. Rutherford, I'm sorry..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Before Alexander could finish, a frail, skeletal old man with grey hair grabbed him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Sit down the way I taught you!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">James commanded with utmost seriousness, his old face showing urgency and tension.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander, saying nothing, sat cross-legged on the floor and closed his eyes, assuming a meditative pose.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Suddenly, James slapped his palm against Alexander's forehead.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Instantly, a surge of immense, overpowering energy flooded Alexander's body. He was overwhelmed by excruciating pain as if every part of him was being torn apart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mr. Rutherford, are you... are you trying to kill me? Why!?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander tried to fight back, but James held him down, preventing him from moving.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">James' voice thundered in Alexander's ears, reverberating like a storm, making his head spin.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Alexander, you've always been a good-hearted boy. You were only eight when we met, and you've stayed by my side for twenty years. Thank you for that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"This is the tenth twenty-year span of my life, and now it's finally time for me to return to the dust. As the last Warrior, today I pass on Ultimate Legacy to you, awakening the Force within you.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You must always uphold the honor of the Warriors, defend justice and fairness, and use the sword in your hand to punish all evil..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was as if thunder exploded next to Alexander's ears, and in the next moment, he lost consciousness.</p><div class="pagination">
