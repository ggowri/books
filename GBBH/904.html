  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was evident that Hazel was no longer a virgin. From her expression, one could see a hint of lewdness in her charm. She must have hooked up with men often.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hazel had just entered </span><span>Kylaville</span><span> University. As the second daughter of the Walsh family, she had a prominent background.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not only was she beautiful, but she was also rich, so she never lacked suitors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The bartender smiled and reminded her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I advise you not to get drunk. Mr. Hunter may show up at any time. If you don't serve him well, you know the consequences."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The bartender smiled wickedly and touched Hazel's swollen chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, none of you men are good."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A sarcastic smile appeared on Hazel's face. She picked up the bottle, poured herself a glass, and drank it all in one gulp.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a drunken state, she couldn't help but recall the party half a year ago that changed her life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a joyful party, attended mainly by her college classmates and the guests invited by other classmates.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hazel had just broken up with her ex-boyfriend, so she was in a bad mood and drank a little too much.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she drank, she felt that the expressions of the men around her had changed. It seemed that they were waiting for her to get drunk so that they could take advantage of her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, men are all cheap..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hazel believed that she saw through men very well and felt that she could completely control men.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Therefore, she was not afraid of the men who were eyeing her covetously. Instead, she looked down on them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the second daughter of the Walsh family, Hazel didn't believe that anyone dared to bully her unless they wanted to die.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No man had ever dared to take advantage of her against her will.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the end, she was drunk and dazed and could no longer sober up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The little bit of rationality she had left told her not to drink anymore, so she tremblingly took out her phone and called the bodyguard to come in and take her home.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before the number was dialed, someone suddenly held her down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey, baby, you're so beautiful!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A tall and handsome young man appeared beside her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hugged Hazel familiarly and whispered in her ear. The warm breath sprayed on her earlobe made Hazel's heart beat fast.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who are you? I... I don't know you..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hazel was drunk and spoke stutteringly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The men around who had the intention but not the courage to do anything thought that this guy was Hazel's friend and was disappointed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jealous eyes were fixed on the man. They just watched him and Hazel clinging to each other.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Baby, it doesn't matter if you don't know me. I know you, and I've had a crush on you for a long time! Be good. Let's go home..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After the man finished speaking, he waved his hand across Hazel's nose.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hazel smelled an odd scent, then felt a surge of dizziness, believing the man before her was handsome, her ideal type.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man smiled triumphantly, then held Hazel in his arms and walked outside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, he said to others, "Get out of the way. My girlfriend is drunk. I need to take her home."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although other men who had feelings for Hazel were surprised that she found a new boyfriend so quickly, they did not dare to ask any more questions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one was bold enough to pretend to be Hazel's boyfriend. That would be courting death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What...what do you want to do?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hazel's eyes were blurry with drunkenness, and she felt excited when she saw the handsome face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alcohol was the devil!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But this man was the devil among devils!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He held Hazel in his arms, nimbly avoided the bodyguards, and took the drunk Hazel directly to a nearby hotel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Baby, from now on, you are my slave girl. In front of me, you have to kneel down and serve me like a dog."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man smiled evilly, took out a crystal tag and put it on her, then carried her directly to the bed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No! Don't!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hazel realized what the man wanted to do, and her remaining rationality drove her to decline the man's intentions firmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But how could a drunk woman, who was also drugged, resist a strong man?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man tore off Hazel's shirt, revealing her plump breasts, which were pink and tender, making men drool.</span></p><div class="pagination">
