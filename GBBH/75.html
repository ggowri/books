  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A wave of shock rippled through the crowd as mocking voices directed their scorn at Theodore.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The Brilliant Group, notorious for its drug trafficking and merciless crimes, was built by the infamous Godfather known as "Reaper."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The organization's chairman, Guzman, was wanted in over a dozen countries, living like a ghost between Sandgo and Mesco to avoid extradition.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Yet here was Theodore, the only son of Sebastian, president of the Brilliant Group, commanding thousands of loyal followers, now reduced to publicly seeking legal protection. It was utterly laughable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Faced with Theodore's threats, Alexander let out a hearty laugh. "Ryan was the first to lose his legs to me. You'll be the second."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In a flash, Alexander tapped each of Theodore's shoulders, his movements so swift that no one could comprehend what had just happened.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The Force sliced through Theodore's arm nerves like a blade.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As Alexander turned and strolled away, the room stood in stunned silence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">They thought, "Is he really just walking away? He was so adamant about crippling Theodore, but now it seems he's afraid of the Brilliant Group's retaliation. What a blowhard!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Theodore, filled with despair, watched Alexander leave, and it was as if he had been thrown a lifeline.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He laughed triumphantly, his confidence surging.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"A waste of space is a waste of space! If you're so tough, why don't you stick around? You said you'd break my hands, didn't you? Come on, you coward!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But suddenly, his laughter came to an abrupt halt.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Theodore's eyes widened in disbelief as he looked at his arms.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"My hands... why can't I move them? What did he do to me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Panic set in as he tried to wave his arms, but they remained completely still, devoid of sensation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Ah! What's wrong with my hands?!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The onlookers gaped, caught off guard by the rapid turn of events.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">David, Mary, and Houtte, seasoned in their experiences, had never witnessed anything so bizarre.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Theodore was genuinely incapacitated, and Alexander hadn't even laid a weapon on him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Oscar muttered to himself, "This is unbelievable. Could that guy be practicing some kind of sorcery?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mary's eyes lit up with realization. "Absolutely! It must be some mysterious magic. Who knew he was not only skilled but also a formidable sorcerer!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The mention of "sorcery" sent a chill down everyone's spine.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Those who had mocked Alexander felt a shiver run down their backs, goosebumps prickling their skin.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">They thought, "What if Alexander has indeed cast some sort of spell on us?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Andrew stammered, turning to Jane, "Sweetheart, do you think Alexander could curse us with magic?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jane was a whirlwind of emotions, grappling with the realization that the man she had shared her life with for five years possessed such abilities she had never noticed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As Alexander approached his battered Toyota, ready to drive away, a familiar voice called out, breathless and urgent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Wait!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He frowned, turning to see Jane rushing toward him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Are you coming to defend Theodore? I'd advise against it; you really don't want to mess with me right now, or else..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He didn't finish his sentence, but the threat hung in the air, palpable enough to send chills down Jane's spine.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Alexander, you're being reckless! If the Brilliant Group decides to retaliate, Ava won't be able to save you!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander raised an eyebrow, taken aback by her words.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Jane, we're divorced. You don't get to dictate my actions."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Fury ignited within her. She thought, "I've set aside my pride to come and warn him, only to be met with indifference?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Alexander, you need to lift that curse off Mr. Tate, or you're going to regret it!" Jane shouted, her voice a mix of desperation and anger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander shot her a cold glance before turning on his heel and getting into the car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jane was seething, stomping her foot, and unleashing a torrent of curses.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Jerk! Just because you've got Ava, that little vixen, you think he can walk all over me. Just wait till Mr. Tate gets his hands on you!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">That evening, Theodore was rushed to the finest private hospital in town. A team of top-notch surgeons and neurologists gathered to consult on his case.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Despite their collective expertise, they were at a complete loss for a viable treatment plan.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">What baffled them even more was that Theodore's arm showed no signs of response, yet astonishingly, the rest of his body was functioning perfectly. It defied all medical logic.</p><div class="pagination">
