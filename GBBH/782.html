  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yvonne spat out a mouthful of blood. Her mind and body were hurt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her mental power was connected to every poison needle. When all the needles were destroyed, her mind was badly shocked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She quickly retreated, but no matter how fast she moved, Rock followed her like a shadow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Die!" Rock grinned and waved his hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A dark mist rolled toward Yvonne's head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If it hit her, Yvonne would surely be killed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yvonne was thrown far away, but she was not hurt at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A light shield appeared around her and blocked the dark mist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You have an amulet?" Rock was both surprised and happy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He turned to look at Monica. She was also shocked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>An amulet that could defend against witchcraft was a treasure that all wizards dreamed of.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Monica's secret weapon was an amulet she found in an ancient witch's tomb.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>That amulet was very powerful. It had saved Monica's life many times and helped her become the ruler of the City of Sorcery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"How does Yvonne have such an amulet?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Did Alexander give it to her? Is that why she became his servant willingly?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"No matter where she got it, we can't let her escape. She can die, but the amulet must stay."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Yes, the amulet must stay in the City of Sorcery."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The wizards talked among themselves. They looked at Yvonne with greed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Rock's witchcraft was blocked, proving that Yvonne's amulet was powerful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Monica glared at Rock, worried that he would take the amulet before she could.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Monica stepped forward and pointed at Yvonne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She shouted, "Give me the amulet, and I will let you live."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The wizards gathered around, looking at Yvonne with greed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yvonne felt pressured, but the amulet gave her a sense of safety.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander had said that with this amulet and her speed, no witch could stop her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Rock saw that Monica wanted to take the amulet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He quickly stepped forward and shouted at Yvonne, "Give me the amulet, and I will forgive you. I will also keep you safe."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Monica glared at Rock and shouted, "Yvonne, I am the ruler of the City of Sorcery. Only I can keep you safe if you give me the amulet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If you give me the amulet and admit your mistake, you can come back to the City of Sorcery. I will even make you the Deputy Ruler."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The wizards were shocked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Rock glared back at Monica with a look that could kill.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Because of Yvonne's amulet, the two strongest wizards were now against each other.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This is funny," Yvonne laughed. "Just as my master predicted, they are fighting over a small benefit."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander planned to break the unity of the City of Sorcery. Now, both Rock and Monica wanted Yvonne's amulet for themselves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Rock, step aside. I will deal with this traitor myself." Monica suddenly attacked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A strange black mist exploded and covered Yvonne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In an instant, the air around them seemed to boil. The temperature rose quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone wondered what kind of witchcraft it was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was not only fast but also made the air so hot that no one could come near.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yvonne reacted quickly, but she was already trapped by Monica's witchcraft.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>There was a loud noise. Black flames burst on the light shield. Monica's attack was blocked by the amulet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yvonne groaned and quickly retreated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Suddenly, she felt a chill on her back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A dark mist hit her back hard. Rock was afraid that Monica would take the amulet, so he attacked Yvonne from behind.</span></p><div class="pagination">
