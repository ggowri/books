  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, Ava turned toward him, her ample chest gently swaying as she moved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander licked his lips, realizing how Ava's figure surpassed that of Jane.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was irresistible!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was perfectly slim and perfectly voluptuous at the same time, a body to die for!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander could barely hold back the urge to rush in and embrace her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who's there? Alexander, is that you?" Ava called out shyly, covering herself as she noticed a shadow outside the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caught spying, Alexander blushed and replied softly, "It's me. How did I end up here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Silence fell in the bathroom as Ava stayed quiet, evidently flustered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a moment, she said, "You collapsed, and Vincent checked you. He said you were just exhausted, so I brought you here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's pulse quickened. Ava's beautiful body was only a door away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he pushed it open, Ava probably wouldn't resist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Creak!" The bathroom door swung open, and Ava stood before him, her face flushed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was wrapped in a white towel, her chest barely covered, the towel reaching just to her thighs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This teasing display only made her look more enticing, and Alexander's gaze roamed over her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you </span><span>really</span><span> okay? You scared me." Ava's voice was soft and gentle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm not okay... There's quite a bit of tension down here&mdash;see for yourself." Alexander gestured to his boner, playfully squeezing her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only in front of Ava did he feel comfortable enough to let loose.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, you're so naughty!" Ava scolded him playfully, brushing his hand aside. "Maybe you should get checked at a hospital?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead, Alexander lifted her, carrying her to the pink bed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as he moved closer, he noticed a small toy by the pillow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmm, what's this?" He asked, grinning mischievously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah! That's... just something for women. Don't touch it!" Flustered, Ava quickly tried to grab it back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she reached, the towel fell away, fully revealing her figure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Holy! Alexander gasped, captivated, and abandoned all thoughts as he embraced her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The scent of body wash mixed with her natural fragrance filled the air, deeply enticing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava held his mischievous hand, breathing heavily as she asked, "A fortune-teller once said I bring bad luck to any man with me. Are you not afraid?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Already lost in the moment, Alexander replied between breaths, "I don't believe in those things."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Be gentle. You're hurting me." Ava clung to him, pressing his head close.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's face was buried against her soft and large breasts. He almost couldn't </span><span>breath</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Desire ignited, and things quickly heated up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet Ava suddenly held him back, whispering, "Not now. It's not the right time."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What? Don't you want to?" Disappointment flashed across Alexander's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm on my period. Just a few more days, okay?" She kissed him, comforting him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Such bad timing." Alexander sighed, deflating beside her on the pillow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Upset?" Ava quickly hugged him again, resting his head against her chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her soft warmth enveloped his face, a glimpse of paradise despite his frustration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're... really something..." Ava looked at his pants with a surprised expression, a mix of shyness, curiosity, and desire in her gaze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you need some help?" She reached out, gently stroking him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander shivered, barely able to contain himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next moment, Ava leaned down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, Alexander felt his thing enveloped by her moist lips. It was simply heaven.</span></p><div class="pagination">
