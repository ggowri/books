  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hurry up and feed the medicine to her!" Marcos shouted arrogantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander did not object, poured a large glass of red wine, and then threw dozens of pills into the wine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing this, Owen sneered triumphantly, "Alexander, weren't you very arrogant just now? It turns out you are afraid of guns, too. Today, you have to watch we sleep with Madelyn."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was so scared that she couldn't believe that Alexander would do this. Then, Madelyn couldn't control her whole body shaking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, you...do you really want me to take medicine?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He patted her shoulder and comforted her. "Don't worry. How could I do this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcos urged unhappily, "Stop talking nonsense and get her to drink it. This medicine is not cheap and cannot be wasted."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander put the wine glass heavily on the table and said with a smile, "Marcos, Owen, you drink this glass of wine, and I can temporarily spare you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What!?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcos thought he had heard wrongly, and the smile on his face froze instantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Owen was even more furious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcos gritted his teeth, aimed at Alexander, and was about to pull the trigger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How dare you to do that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander quickly grabbed his gun-holding hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcos' fingers were pinched by Alexander, so he couldn't move at all, let alone pull the trigger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Marcos, what are you waiting for? Shoot now!" Owen was still shouting inexplicably.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a scream, Marcos was slapped to the ground by Alexander, and his gun flew away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Owen turned around and tried to run, but Alexander caught up with him and kicked him in the butt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Owen fell heavily to the ground, wailing non-stop.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this time, Zachary rushed in again with his men to stop Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Leo, this is the guy. We must not let him go. Otherwise, Miranda Hotel's reputation will be completely ruined." Zachary gave orders to a burly middle-aged man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The strong man was Miranda Hotel's security chief, Leo Cruz, who had learned martial arts when he was a child and had mastered it to perfection.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Alexander was about to teach Owen a lesson, Leo quickly stood in front of Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How dare you do that? This is Miranda Hotel. Every distinguished guest here will be </span><span>protected by us. You are not allowed to do anything reckless."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leo widened his eyes and stared at him ferociously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, Owen immediately became excited again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Lewis, quickly destroy this guy. Look at what he has done to us. This will seriously damage Miranda Hotel's reputation. Who will dare to come and spend money here in the future?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He turned around and threatened Alexander, "You can't run away. Leo is the new underground boxing king of </span><span>Tijuanea</span><span>. Why don't you kneel down and apologize? Are you waiting to be beaten?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander sneered and slapped Owen on the body like lightning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Force that had been dormant in Owen's body awakened, drilling in and out of his brain like a drill.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You... What are you doing to me? It hurts!" Owen screamed miserably and fell to the ground, foaming at the mouth and twitching.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcos was startled and shouted quickly, "Mr. Lewis, Leo, please save me, please save me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leo was frightened by Alexander's strange method and pretended to be calm. "So, you know how to poison, right? This kind of despicable trick can't scare me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smiled disdainfully, "Did I poison you? You know nothing."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing that, Leo became angry. He suddenly jumped up and charged toward Alexander like an angry rhinoceros.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kneel down!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He raised his fists and hit both sides of Alexander's head with great force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Alexander stood there motionless as if he was frightened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leo immediately smiled triumphantly, "It turns out he's just a fool who can poison people. I overestimated him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As his fist was about to touch Alexander's cheek, he finally made his move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander grabbed Leo's fist like lightning, and the Force suddenly burst out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The powerful force was like a tornado, knocking Leo's fist back and hitting him hard in the face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a shrill roar, Leo fell heavily to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He tried to struggle to get up but was kicked away by Alexander and fainted completely.</span></p><div class="pagination">
