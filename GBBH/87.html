  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Andrew rolled his eyes in frustration. "Daughter, you've got it all wrong. Mr. Sebastian Tate is definitely going to teach that scumbag Alexander a lesson. He'll make sure the Brilliant Group's dignity is upheld."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I can just picture it. Sebastian will break Alexander's hands and feet, then make him grovel like a dog, and finally, put a bullet in him to send him straight to hell!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Andrew relished the thought, his hatred for Alexander bubbling over.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Belinda clapped her hands in glee. "That sounds fantastic! I can't wait to see that jerk get what's coming to him. That bastard has done nothing but ruin our Fairfax family!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If it weren't for him, my daughter wouldn't have wasted five years of her youth!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If it weren't for him, Mr. Hawkins wouldn't be rotting in prison, and Mr. Tate wouldn't be lying in a hospital bed. Alexander deserves every bit of this!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The couple continued to curse Alexander with enthusiasm, their anger fueling their words.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Meanwhile, Jane furrowed her brow, her voice barely above a whisper. "What if Mr. Sebastian Tate fails?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Andrew snapped back, his voice booming, "Shut it! What's gotten into you? Why are you defending that loser Alexander?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yeah, Jane! Alexander is the one who's caused you all this trouble. You should be celebrating, not defending him!" Belinda chimed in, her hand brushing Jane's forehead as if checking for a fever.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jane fell silent, her recent sleepless nights weighing heavily on her. It would be a lie to say she had no regrets about the divorce.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At that very moment, Sebastian was being rushed into the hospital, cradling his head and crying out in pain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It felt as if a power drill were burrowing into his skull, and he wished for nothing more than to end the agony with a single bullet.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He was immediately taken to the intensive care unit.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">News of the Brilliant Group president's mysterious illness quickly spread throughout the hospital.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A team of specialists convened, running a battery of tests, including CT scans, MRIs, and EEGs. To their astonishment, they couldn't find a single issue.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the end, they had no choice but to inject Sebastian with a hefty dose of painkillers, which provided only slight relief.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The relentless drilling sensation in his head persisted, overshadowing even the pain in his injured hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As he lay there, his thoughts drifted back to Alexander's ominous warning. If he didn't reveal Guzman's whereabouts, he would wish for death in three days.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The fate of his son's hands rested in Alexander's hands, and the weight of that realization twisted like a knife in his gut.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The thought of betraying his cousin Guzman sent shivers down Sebastian's spine.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Sebastian couldn't shake the memory of Guzman's ruthless nature; the man was a true devil.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But then again, wasn't Alexander a terrifying devil in his own right?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The more Sebastian pondered, the worse his headache became. Suddenly, a scream tore from his throat as darkness enveloped him, and he collapsed, unconscious.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Chaos ensued in the hospital room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just one night had passed since Sebastian had been subjected to incessant torment. His eyes were dark circles, his face a sickly shade of gray; even the effort to wiggle his fingers was a struggle.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The feeling of a drill in his brain was a relentless, cruel form of torture.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Had it not been for the potent painkillers, Sebastian would have succumbed to the despair of taking his own life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A renowned neurologist, whose fee was astronomical, rushed to the hospital at night and conducted a series of examinations.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Upon finishing, Professor Dylan Baker fell silent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Dylan, what's in my head? Am I cursed, or is it some illness?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Sebastian clung to Dylan's hand, desperate for answers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Dylan stammered, his face betraying fear, "Mr. Sebastian Tate, please try to keep calm. The more you overreact, the worse it gets... I'm truly sorry, but I can't provide a diagnosis.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"According to the test results, you're perfectly healthy with no issues whatsoever.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"However, the current situation... If it's not psychological, it could be a case of legendary curses or witchcraft..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Witchcraft? I'm doomed, I'm truly doomed... Who can save me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Sebastian collapsed onto the hospital bed, despair enveloping his heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At that moment, Dylan cautioned, "Mr. Sebastian Tate, based on my speculation, your condition cannot be delayed any longer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If we don't find an effective treatment within the next couple of days, with a decline in your body's functions, multi-organ failure could follow... That would be perilous..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Dylan handed Sebastian a notice of critical condition.</p><div class="pagination">
