  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander pulled Logan aside and found a place for them to sit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Logan, don't panic," he said reassuringly. "Let's take a look at how to grow these melons first."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They opened the small booklet and started reading carefully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All of a sudden, Logan let out a shout. "So that's why! These Verdant Crown Melons can't touch metal, or they'll rot. No wonder we have to use emerald hoes!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander frowned as he read further. "Energy-Gathering Technique... adjust breathing... move with strength and precision while farming... power should be in the feet when walking, and the waist should initiate movement changes... Is this a farming guide or a martial arts manual?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He finished reading the book, thought for a moment, then sat cross-legged and closed his eyes. Holding his hands loosely together, he let his thumbs form an oval shape, just as the book described, and began meditating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At first, he felt nothing. He was about to open his eyes when, suddenly, a warmth spread through the left side of his chest. It was as if something was drawing in pure energy from the air around him. That energy turned into tiny, warm currents that flowed through his blood, entering his martial core and condensing into a new kind of power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Slowly, the energy gathered into a tiny, bead-sized Force cluster, sending out hair-thin strands of power that traveled through his meridians. A wave of comfort washed over Alexander. He felt weightless, almost euphoric.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mmm... This feels incredible... But what is this mysterious golden energy?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a while, he opened his eyes and glanced at Logan, who was also meditating. The round-faced man looked completely at peace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander turned slightly and pulled open his coarse linen tunic. There, on the left side of his chest, something golden flickered faintly. A blurry, shimmering figure seemed to pulse in rhythm with his heartbeat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What is this? No... This isn't right... A movie... The golden words bursting out of the Immersive Viewing Helmet... the warmth... the Force..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His mind raced, connecting the dots, but no matter how hard he tried, he couldn't recall what had actually happened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A strange feeling gnawed at him. It was as if... he didn't belong to this world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His thoughts were a complete blank. No matter how much he struggled, he still couldn't remember anything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A dozen days later, under the scorching summer sun, two figures, one tall, one stout, were sweating profusely in the emerald melon fields, hoes in hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The emerald hoes in their grip emitted a faint white glow. As soon as the glow touched the soil, it vanished, yet the Verdant Crown Melons nearby seemed to grow just a little larger. They had grown noticeably bigger than before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Logan stood up, wiped the sweat off his forehead, and looked up at the sun.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He grumbled, "Alexander, why couldn't we have been kings? Why did we end up farming melons instead?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander tried to comfort him. "I heard the Head Priest Hezekiah is incredibly powerful. The Spiritual Awakening he gave us has made a lot of people jealous. Besides, we've learned Arhat Fist and the Energy-Gathering Technique. If we ever get the chance to go back, we'll be unstoppable."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Logan stretched and twisted his body. "Ugh, this rough linen is so itchy."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tossing his emerald hoe aside, he wandered off to take a break.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Alexander's thoughts grew heavier. Hezekiah was said to be the wisest of men.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Spiritual Awakening could enhance intelligence and strengthen the body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "The Energy-Gathering Technique can absorb energy from the world itself. Mount Haldrith, Dominion Church... What kind of world is this?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Where did I really come from?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lately, he and Logan had been gathering information from Jalen and an elderly neighbor, Dilan Glyn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They learned that this land was called Sahasia, and the kingdom they were in was Darwin. Unlike traditional walled cities, Darwin City spanned thousands of miles, housing over a hundred million people.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for the full size of Sahasia, even Jalen and Dilan didn't know. To most people, this world seemed endless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had also heard that many other nations existed far beyond. Among them, the Risunese, a people from the sea kingdom of Risun, frequently raided the empire. They called themselves the "Nation of the Sun."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the heart of Darwin City stood Mount Haldrith, where the Dominion Church was located. The church covered dozens of miles, surrounded by farmland that stretched for hundreds more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The church was divided into several sections: the Top Court, Inner Court, Outer Court, and the Management Center. The Top Court housed over a hundred thousand cultivators, and split into three factions: Great Sect, Hina Sect, and Treasure Sect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Inner Court and Outer Court were home to lay disciples who acted as protectors of the church.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Many powerful individuals resided in the Inner Court, and it was said they frequently went out to exterminate demons.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Outer Court was filled with highly skilled warriors. Some of the most renowned generals in the empire had once been Outer Court disciples.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Management Center oversaw permanent residents and laborers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In total, the church's staff and workers numbered over a million, spread across hundreds of manors outside the main grounds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emerald Manor was one of them. It was dedicated to cultivating Verdant Crown Melons. For ordinary people, eating these melons could extend life, cure diseases, and even help surpass physical limits.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Logan stretched lazily. "Alexander, do you think we somehow got transported into a movie? I mean, Sahasia was mentioned in that film too..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He suddenly thought of something and smirked. "Alexander, thank goodness for that old friar...uh, I mean, Head Priest Hezekiah...touching our heads. If not, we probably wouldn't have learned the Energy-Gathering Technique at all. I heard from Dilan that most people take at least half a year to grasp it. The weaker or dumber ones? More than a year, and they still can't figure it out."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Logan crossed his legs and sat comfortably on the edge of the field, looking completely at ease.</span></p><div class="pagination">
