  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Of course, if a storm really were to strike, the magic circle protecting Treasure Island would consume a large </span><span>amount</span><span> of high-level gems.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Alexander owned a great deal of gem mines in </span><span>Soutaxia</span><span>, which could provide him with a steady supply of gems to support the consumption.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After purchasing several surrounding islands, he would set up protective magic circles on each island to make the sea area peaceful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These islands could support each other and develop jointly, and various underground industries, tourism, and resorts would be profitable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gradually, more and more people came to the party.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone was the leader of a force and had several subordinates, regardless of their strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For a moment, the beach was crowded with people.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The air was filled with the aroma of barbecue, making people salivate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The participants drank vodka and ate barbecued meat, fish, seafood, etc., laughing and chatting happily. It was like a real party.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Alexander was standing in front of the floor-to-ceiling glass on the top floor of the building.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosalia and Charlize were both naked, kneeling with their hands on the glass. Their plump breasts were pressed against the glass.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne, will they see me?" Rosalia asked shyly, trembling constantly and feeling very excited.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander spanked her on the full butt and scolded, "Do you want them to see you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosalia screamed in fear, "No! I don't want them to see me. Mr. Hawthorne, I only want you to see me..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smiled, "Don't worry. This is one-way glass. They can't see us, but we can see them."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Charlize came up to Rosalia, grabbed her buxom breasts that drooped slightly, and chuckled, "Don't worry. Even if we are seen by other men, it will be Mr. Hawthorne who suffers, not us."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander felt speechless and pinched Charlize hard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Charlize screamed and groaned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smiled, "We will have to go downstairs to meet those trash later, so don't dawdle. Be prepared to accept my reward!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He seized Rosalia's plump buttocks and thrust himself into her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She opened her mouth to cry out something, but could not utter a word. Her expression was extremely complicated and dazed, as if she was completely overwhelmed by the pleasure...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>More than an hour later, when the party was at its height, Alexander finally emerged from the office.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosalia and Charlize followed him closely. Their faces were flushed, and their legs were slightly limp. It was so intense that it was certainly no less than taking part in a </span><span>hard fight.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Along the way, there were many guards in charge of security. At the sight of Alexander, Rosalia, and Charlize, they all bowed their heads and saluted respectfully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although it was an open-air barbecue, the scene was beautifully decorated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were dining tables and a variety of fine wines, meats, vegetables, and fruits everywhere.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, the lights are bright, making one feel especially happy and relaxed against the backdrop of a bright starry sky, twinkling stars, and the endless sound of waves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Alexander appeared, a band began to play music, and the pleasant and elegant melody echoed in everyone's ears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Most people noticed him. The leaders of major forces had very complicated and interesting expressions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Some had fawning smiles on their faces, some bowed and nodded, and some even led the way like waiters.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They must have had a certain amount of strength to be able to be leaders, but they were like rats to a cat before Alexander.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander grinned slightly and had begun to get used to such occasions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, Alexander thought of Jane, who was far away in </span><span>Loscity</span><span>. Ever since Andrew was arrested and imprisoned, there had been no news from the Fairfax family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She hadn't bothered him for a while. Upon reflection, he felt grateful to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If she hadn't forced him to divorce, he would definitely not have had his present happy life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosalia and Charlize stood on either side of him, and Alexander openly embraced them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They did not refuse. Instead, they snuggled up to him tenderly, their voluptuous, sensual bodies pressed so tightly against him that there was a burst of envious discussion.&#8203;</span></p><div class="pagination">
