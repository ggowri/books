  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill!" Weston shouted, his cunning mind spinning into action as he pivoted to charge at Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew the strategy&mdash;capture the king before taking out the pawns.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Weston had deliberately let Alexander slip by earlier, focusing instead on Augusta. Now, he aimed to catch Alexander off-guard from behind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix had warned him about Alexander's strength, but Weston couldn't fathom that a mere twenty-something could pose a real threat. Surely, he thought, there must be someone backing Alexander up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With his level-two strength power surging, Weston felt his speed increase significantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While he might not match Augusta's agility, he was like a gust of wind as he closed in on Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But to his surprise, the formidable opponent he had been chasing didn't even flinch; instead, Augusta turned to him with a sinister grin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A chill ran down Weston's spine, but he pressed on, determined to seize the moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get down!" he shouted, bringing his palm down with all his might toward Alexander's back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The force of his strike sliced through the air, and a vicious smile crept across Weston's face. He couldn't wait to make this punk pay.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But suddenly, a swift gust of wind rushed past him as Alexander spun around, mirroring his attack with a palm strike of his own.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The impact was thunderous, a deafening crack that reverberated through the air as their palms met.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Weston's expression shifted from confidence to sheer shock as he felt the force of Alexander's blow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Weston was sent flying backward as if he had been hit by a cannonball, his body exploding in a shower of blood and flesh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gore splattered everywhere, but in a remarkable twist, an invisible barrier stopped the gruesome remnants before they could touch Alexander, leaving him untouched.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander scoffed, a cruel smirk appearing on his face. "Hmph, you brought this on yourself."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Morris family members, who had once thought of Weston as one of their strongest fighters, now stood dumbfounded as they witnessed him reduced to nothing more than a bloody pulp by Alexander's single strike.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You'll pay for this!" Rumen cried out, clutching his severed arm and glaring at Alexander with venomous hatred.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander shot him a cold glance, hardly interested. Rumen was losing too much blood to last much longer, and Alexander couldn't be bothered to waste words on him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're going to die! You will suffer a terrible fate!" Rumen </span><span>spat,</span><span> his face contorted with rage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander regarded him with disdain like a grim reaper in human form.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your doom was sealed the moment the Morris family allied with Felix."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His tone was chilling, devoid of warmth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You can't do this! Mr. Frederick Morris will kill you! You'll die here, and I'll hang your corpse from a tree for the vultures to pick at, let the wolves gnaw on your bones..." Rumen cursed, his voice dripping with malice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But before he could finish, Alexander waved his hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A flash of white light sliced through the air, and in an instant, Rumen was cleaved in half, crashing to the ground with a look of sheer horror frozen on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The remaining members of the Morris family recoiled in terror, their fear of Alexander growing as they witnessed the slaughter. They scattered like leaves in a storm, with Augusta ruthlessly hunting them down from behind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From a distance, Frederick and Felix observed the chaos, their expressions grave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Frederick, usually brimming with confidence, felt a knot of doubt twist in his gut as he watched Weston explode into a bloody mess.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Frederick wondered, "This is a formidable opponent! Who could possibly stand against him?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And he's at such a young age. How powerful Alexander will become in a few decades. Will he be invincible?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Frederick watched his family members fall, one by one, into pools of their own blood, anger and a thirst for vengeance surged within him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, he found himself weighing the balance of power between himself and Alexander, struggling to determine where he stood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he didn't have a solid plan, Frederick wouldn't risk making a move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix, on the other hand, glared at Alexander, his eyes ablaze with fury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Frederick, I'm giving you one last chance&mdash;hand over Felix, and maybe I'll spare a few lives from the Morris family!" Alexander's voice rang out coldly as if he were a king issuing commands to his subjects.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Frederick's teeth ground together, his grip tightening around his glass until it shattered in his hand.</span></p><div class="pagination">
