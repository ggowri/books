  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne, thank you for your help. Lara, keep Mr. Hawthorne company and have a nice chat."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ralph, humbled, no longer pulled rank and respectfully called Alexander "Mr. Hawthorne," even instructing his granddaughter to treat him well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lara's face turned crimson with excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry, Grandpa. I won't disappoint Alexander."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander chuckled, unable to resist Lara's curvy, voluptuous figure. Indeed, she wouldn't disappoint.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quentin and Alexander exchanged contacts and arranged a time to visit </span><span>Tijuanea</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Thompson, why is your grandson in </span><span>Tijuanea</span><span>?" Alexander asked curiously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quentin sighed. "There are wizards from the City of Sorcery there. To keep him alive, I had no other choice..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander nodded, not pressing further; it seemed curing Quentin's grandson wouldn't be easy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But since Treasure Island was only a few hundred miles from </span><span>Tijuanea</span><span>, it would be a good opportunity to visit Cloe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Lara held onto Alexander's arm and was about to step out, Ralph suddenly smiled and said, "The first of the month is only a few days away. At the family meeting, I will publicly announce you, Lara, as the successor."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lara was overjoyed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you, Grandpa!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ralph gazed at his granddaughter meaningfully and said, "Lara, Alexander is a good man. You should cherish him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both Lara and Alexander blushed, surprised that their relationship had been seen through. Experience truly comes with age.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once they left the room, they noticed Mateo and the guards were gone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you, Alexander!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lara hugged Alexander tightly, showering his face with kisses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander wrapped his arm around her slender waist, his hands exploring her curvy, soft figure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Mmm</span><span>!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lara tensed up, feeling Alexander's warm hands roam over her body, leaving her breathless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, not here... Grandpa might catch us..." Lara whispered shyly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lara's voice was sweet and bashful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then let's find an empty room upstairs," Alexander suggested gently, his touch unusually skilled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His fingers lightly grazed her full chest, then moved to her rounded hips, exploring them playfully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lara's entire body tingled as she couldn't resist reaching for Alexander's pants...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander pulled her into his arms, kissing her as he strode toward the stairs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A short flight of stairs took them several minutes to climb.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it weren't for Alexander's strong self-control, the same Lara who was worried about getting caught by her grandpa would have already undressed him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, I think my chest got bigger after the last time we did it," Lara said boldly, showing off her figure for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wow!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander involuntarily sucked in a breath; she was simply stunning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her voluptuous, fair skin had a hint of girlish pink.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The second room upstairs is the study. It should be empty..." Lara directed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander scooped her up in his arms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lara felt Alexander's hands supporting her hips, and his masculine scent overwhelmed her senses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander, equally captivated by Lara's smooth, soft body, felt his passion surge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Alexander reached the study door, Lara wrapped her arms around his neck, pulling him into a deep kiss.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Passion flared instantly, with Lara's soft, full chest pressing firmly against his.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander had already admired her figure. She was childless, with only him as her partner, she remained full and firm, feeling marvelous to the touch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He channeled Force energy to his fingers, teasing Lara with intense sensations.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lara shuddered violently, the irresistible itch driving her wild.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The itch was accompanied by waves of tingling pleasure that nearly drove Lara mad.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under such intense stimulation, Lara had to bite her lip to avoid making any noise, afraid of being overheard. It would be too embarrassing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her forced restraint made her entire body tremble slightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander chuckled, quickening his movements, gently caressing her sensitive spots, using various techniques.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Poor Lara couldn't take it anymore; despite trying her best to hold back, she still let out soft moans.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander felt Lara's full chest pressing tighter against him, becoming more resilient.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A woman at the peak of passion often reacts this way.</span></p><div class="pagination">
