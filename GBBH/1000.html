  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava remained silent, picking up the check and glancing at it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mistaking her silence for acceptance, Grace smiled triumphantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But before she could utter another word, Ava took the check, tore it into pieces, and flung the shreds in front of her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You! What do you think you're doing?" Grace yelled as her face flushed red with anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a voice as cold as frost, Ava retorted, "You think you can buy me off? Tearing your check was the kindest response you could've hoped for!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grace clenched her jaw, forcing herself to calm down. In a low, controlled voice, she said, "If you think the amount isn't enough, I can add more. Two billion dollars. No. How about three?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava yelled coldly, "Get out. No amount of money will make me leave Alexander. If you really have the capability, make him leave me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The room seemed to grow colder as Grace hesitated and gritted her teeth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're really not willing to reconsider? Leave Alexander, and not only will I give you whatever money you want, but I'll agree to any conditions you set.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My grandfather is the second most powerful man in </span><span>Avalora</span><span>. He can do things no ordinary person can."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava smirked with a victorious glint in her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Lawson, I'm sorry. Alexander is my boyfriend, and that's not something money or favors can buy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, leave."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She pointed toward the door with an icy expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grace's face paled with rage, her chest heaving as she clenched her fists so tightly her knuckles turned white.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bang!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The doors burst open, and two groups of men stormed in. Half were security guards from the Brilliant Group; the other half were Grace's bodyguards.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Guns were drawn in an instant, the security team and bodyguards pointing weapons at each other. Violence was teetering on the edge of eruption.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grace weighed her options and waved her hand abruptly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's go!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before leaving, she turned back to Ava, her voice dripping with sarcasm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You'd better think carefully, Ava. Alexander has made enemies with some very powerful people.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And don't think for a second that the Vance family will just let this slide. With what you're capable of, do you really think you can help Alexander?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you want Alexander to have a future, you'll leave him before it's too late."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Grace spun on her heel, her high heels clicking sharply against the marble floor as she stormed out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a complex expression on her face, Ava watched her leave and allowed herself a cold, mocking smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She murmured, "This is the first time a woman has dared to challenge me like this. What will Alexander do when he finds out?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as she reached for her phone to call him, her secretary burst into the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Blackburn! Something bad has happened!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava frowned, trying to maintain her composure. "Calm down and tell me what's going on."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Blackburn, a crowd of customers is marching toward our headquarters. They're claiming our magic powder has severe side effects and has harmed them!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava's heart skipped a beat. "That's impossible."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her phone began to ring insistently, distributors flooding her inbox with similar complaints that the magic powder had severe side effects.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Titanli</span><span> Group was demanding a product recall! The agents in </span><span>Wuluth</span><span> were doing the same! Reports were flooding into Ava from agents across several neighboring cities, all claiming the magic powder had grave side effects, with numerous fatalities linked to it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava grasped the gravity of the situation, her mind swirling with uncertainty and concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The magic powder had undergone the most stringent of tests, confirming it was free of side effects. What's more, it had been on the market for a considerable time without a single report of adverse reactions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Why, all of a sudden, were there so many issues cropping up? And why were people stirring up trouble right at the group's doorstep?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What is going on?" she muttered, trying to make sense of the chaos.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She pondered, "The formula is flawless. Could there have been an issue with the raw materials during manufacturing? Or might someone </span><span>have</span><span> tampered with the final product, poisoning it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before she could even regain her footing from Grace's relentless provocations, this unforeseen crisis blindsided her, leaving her truly off balance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She pondered, "Could Grace be orchestrating this? No, that can't be right. Given how much she cares for Alexander, she wouldn't sabotage the powder's reputation. There has to be another explanation. Could the Vance family be pulling the strings here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The more Ava mulled it over, the more plausible it seemed. She hurriedly instructed someone to summon Julian Whitman, the director overseeing warehouse operations.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The line kept ringing, but no one picked up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After several attempts, Julian's phone was switched off, and he was completely unreachable.</span></p><div class="pagination">
