  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The injury from the war had lingered for decades.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had visited countless renowned hospitals and specialists, but none could help.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, as he aged, the injury worsened, and he was running out of time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Worse, the pain flared up daily, making life unbearable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sir, the root of your problem is in your brain, an old injury. With current medical technology, the pain can only be alleviated, not cured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Recently, your condition has worsened. It's splitting headaches, sleepless nights, and declining health. Am I right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander spoke calmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How do you know that?! Did Lara tell you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ralph looked at him, utterly shocked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lara quickly shook her head. "Grandpa, I didn't say a word, really!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her expression was serious and determined, clearly not lying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ralph stared gravely at Alexander. His condition was known only to his closest confidants, not even most of the Hansen family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Could Alexander really be that skilled?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander turned to Quentin and said confidently, "Mr. Thompson, I can ease Sir Hansen's pain and extend his life. Can you keep your word?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quentin's eyes lit up, and he answered firmly, "Rest assured, as Commander of the Northern Command and a four-star general, I always keep my word!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ralph gave a self-deprecating smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you two using this old bag of bones for an experiment?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander placed his hand seriously on Ralph's shoulder, slowly channeling the Force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Through Force Sense, he detected a tiny fragment lodged in Ralph's right brain, impossible to remove with current medical technology.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a miracle Ralph had survived for decades despite it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Alexander couldn't remove the fragment, he could encase it with the Force, reducing Ralph's pain and prolonging his life for some time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander didn't plan to relieve all the pain at once. People rarely cherish what comes too easily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, Alexander deliberately stimulated Ralph's brain tissue with the Force, causing mild pain to keep him cautious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lara stood by, wide-eyed, not daring to even breathe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quentin also watched Alexander's actions intently. If he could really help Ralph, there was hope for his bedridden grandson too.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, Ralph felt a warm current fill his head. It's a strange sensation, both hot and itchy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It felt like a swarm of ants crawling inside his head, but the itchiness also eased the pain considerably.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The discomfort gradually faded, replaced by an increasing sense of comfort and lightness, as if he were floating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eventually, Ralph fell asleep from the comfort, even letting out a soft snore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lara's face lit up with joy. Her grandfather hadn't slept well in a long time; it was clear that asking Alexander to treat him was the right decision.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a while, Alexander withdrew his hand, stopping the flow of the Force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ralph felt the warm current recede like a tide, abruptly waking him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He touched his head, deeply moved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you, Mr. Hawthorne. I feel much better. You truly have a gift."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was a trace of reluctance in Ralph's eyes. The comfort he'd just experienced was addictive, making him feel much lighter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sir, with monthly treatments, living a few more years won't be a problem."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander spoke confidently, exuding an aura of authority.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quentin's eyes narrowed. This young man was truly skilled and unfathomable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne, my grandson is bedridden. If you could help ease his suffering, I promise the military will buy the magic powder for no less than half the market price!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quentin promised earnestly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, but I expect you to keep your word, Mr. Thompson. Also, I demand severe punishment for Schroder!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander said expressionlessly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Alexander's cold gaze, Quentin, a battle-hardened general, felt a sudden chill.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was a four-star general, forged in the fires of war, yet here he was, intimidated by a man in his twenties. It was simply unbelievable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quentin wasn't mistaken; if Alexander wished, he could take his life at any moment!</span></p><div class="pagination">
