One was led by Rosen, another by Otis Stowe, and the last was for Schroder's personal protection.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Betty and Charlize by Alexander's side, Otis assumed Alexander was there for a beach outing, completely surrounded and trapped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What he didn't know was that Alexander's elite team was present, and besides William, all his core members had arrived.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Augusta, Marvin, and Logan hidden in the crowd, watched Otis' team closely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Charlize sensed something was off. The hostile stares were unnerving.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Alexander remained calm, exuding confidence that reassured Charlize.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Betty felt slightly anxious, knowing a fierce battle was inevitable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Through his earpiece, Alexander instructed Augusta not to let anyone escape&mdash;swift action was essential.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A few thugs had already crept close, fingers twitching toward their holstered guns.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The bullets were loaded and ready to fire!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander knew he couldn't wait any longer. It was time to strike first.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Charlize, Betty, stay safe," he warned, then sprang up from his beach chair like a tiger pouncing on prey, launching himself toward the nearest foe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His speed was blinding. The closest thug was still twenty feet away, yet Alexander appeared at his side like a specter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it!" the man cursed as he drew his gun.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Whoosh!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's fist crashed into the man's face with tremendous force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a blood-curdling scream, the thug flew backward, colliding violently with two others behind him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, Alexander vanished from sight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When they finally spotted him again, he had seized another enemy by the throat, lifting him high and slamming him down hard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thud!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man's body sank into the sand, unconscious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander unleashed his full power, demonstrating terrifying speed and strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each strike cut through the air with a sharp whistle. Although Schroder's men were elite, they were no match for an enraged Warrior.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Screams erupted as, in the blink of an eye, five men fell before Alexander's might.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bang! Bang!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, someone fired their weapon, but they couldn't keep up with Alexander's speed. The bullets flew wild, causing chaos among the beachgoers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two who shot were the unluckiest, quickly taken down by Alexander's wrath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This guy is a monster!

Otis yelled, the first to turn and flee.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In moments, more men were falling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Otis ran a few paces, he suddenly felt a sharp pain in his throat&mdash;Alexander had him in a vice grip.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let me go...!" Otis gasped, struggling to pry Alexander's fingers away, but it was futile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smirked, tightening his grip, and with a snap, Otis' neck broke, leaving him limp.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Like hauling trash, Alexander lifted Otis and charged into the enemy ranks, swinging him around like a windmill.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The whoosh of wind accompanied the continuous screams as he sent a whole crowd tumbling down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Everyone, get in there! Don't let them escape!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Augusta was already coordinating the team into a curved formation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thirty specially trained subordinates lacked only real combat experience compared to true special forces members.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, under the leadership of Alexander and Augusta, their morale soared, while the opposing team had already lost half their numbers and were terrified.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dozens of them charged forward like fierce tigers, launching a relentless attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, the enemy was now reduced to half their original number, terrified and demoralized.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The remaining ones surrendered, hands over their heads, kneeling in defeat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blood stained the beach as a group writhed in agony, the scene resembling a hell on Earth.</span></p><div class="pagination">
