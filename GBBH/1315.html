  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander is here; make way." The crowd stepped aside for Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Alexander approached, he noticed two notices posted on the wall at the manor gate. One bore the seal of the Hrodvik government, while the other carried the seal of the Dominion Church.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[The selection of lay disciples for the Dominion Church will be overseen by the Ministry of Defense and the Dominion Church. Auspicious dates will be chosen for the examination.]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander felt both excitement and unease. The good news was that he hadn't expected the chance to join the Dominion Church to come so soon. The bad news was that the church could only host a little over a hundred thousand members.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Hrodvik Empire stretched endlessly, home to countless millions. How many would actually make it through the selection? The odds were likely one in ten thousand, if not worse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And then there was the battle raging in his mind. Warrior? Doomsday crisis? These thoughts clashed endlessly, making it harder and harder to bear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fortunately, life at Emerald Manor was peaceful. The overseers didn't have much to do. The workers wouldn't dare slack off as the harvest had to be delivered on time. That left Alexander free to train with Logan in the woods east of the manor every day.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But as he advanced to the first level of warrior training, the effects of the Energy-gathering Technique started to weaken. It was likely just an entry-level technique used by the Dominion Church to recruit talents while farming.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For most people, deciphering the Muscle-Tendon Classic was no easy feat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Alexander and Logan had received the Spiritual Awakening of Head Priest Hezekiah. He had placed his hand on their heads and declared them gifted, smarter than most, even among geniuses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the woods, Alexander steadied his breath, calming his mind as he focused his energy deep into his core. He activated the Force within him, guiding it through his body. Following the key principles of the Muscle-Tendon Classic, he began drawing in the energy of heaven and earth, refining it into pure force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Almost immediately, a sense of clarity washed over him. His entire body felt cool and refreshed, and the energy he absorbed was at least three or four times stronger than what he could gather with the usual Energy-gathering Technique.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>More importantly, in the past, only about half of the energy he absorbed would be converted into the Force, the rest dissipating back into the world. But with the Muscle-Tendon Classic, at least 80 to 90% of it was refined into the Force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, the golden mark on his left chest radiated a stronger warmth than ever.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Alexander completed an entire cycle of the Muscle-Tendon Classic, he let out a long breath and stood up, exhilarated. One round of training with this method was equivalent to half a day's effort before. Even more incredible, the Force within him could now draw in a significant amount of metal from the surrounding forces, further strengthening his body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the Muscle-Tendon Classic and the mysterious golden mark, his training efficiency had increased severalfold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The selection for the lay disciples was in three months. The biggest problem now was time. If Alexander wanted any real chance of making it, he had to reach level-two warrior within the next three months.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After finishing his practice, Alexander focused on refining his combat techniques. There were six core moves, and he could only learn the first two at his current level. "Floral Grasp" and "Vajra's Strike" were techniques accessible to level-one warriors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shifting Stars" required level two. "Dragon's Fury" required the level three. "Seismic Cleave" demanded level four, and "Heaven's Gaze" was reserved for level-five warriors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander started with Floral Grasp. It was a defense technique. He adjusted his stance, eyes level, weight shifting, feet bending like a drawn bow. His body moved like a great dragon, his left hand plucking an invisible flower, his right hand holding an unseen leaf.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not far away, Logan practiced Arhat Fist in another clearing, each strike powerful and precise. His shouts echoed through the forest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Time slipped away unnoticed. A month had passed. Alexander could feel his organs growing stronger, his breath more powerful. The Force within him was now closer to the size of a pea, and it had even begun to rotate slightly. If things continued at this pace, the Force would vortex within two more months. At that point, success would be all but certain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Alexander had no progress in breaking through to the level-two warrior.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Frustration gnawed at him. He steadied his stance and launched into Arhat Fist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A faint rumble echoed through the air. The wind whipped around Alexander, and his fists cut through it with sharp, whistling force. There was a loud crack as he executed "Wind Chaser." A thick, ancient pine in the forest snapped clean in two.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander finished all 108 moves in one go and stood still. A more profound frustration settled over him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By all accounts, Alexander had reached the peak of a level-one warrior. His punches were unstoppable, powerful enough to break trees with ease. His mastery of the first two moves of Muscle-Tendon Classic and Arhat Fist was flawless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Alexander were back in his original world, he could probably win every boxing championship belt and every gold medal in boxing without breaking a sweat. And yet, he had no clue how to break through to level two.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Alexander! Did you just punch down another tree?" Logan, drawn by the noise, strolled over with a grin. "You can't just go around beating up innocent trees. Show some love for nature, man!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
