  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quentin changed his expression and said seriously, "Mr. Hawthorne, just tell me, and I </span><span>can cooperate with you in any way you want!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"According to what we have agreed upon before, you should make the military raise the price of the magic powder for storage, and I will not pursue the matter of Schroder's death any further."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For the sake of Scott, Quentin lowered his posture and let Alexander have the final say.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander pondered for a while and said, "I heard that the Red Umbrella Group has developed a second-generation potential potion, and I want to buy a batch. Also, I need all the information about Felix, the chairman of the Red Umbrella Group."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quentin frowned immediately, "Although the second-generation potential potion is difficult to obtain, I can find a way to get it. As for Felix's information, it belongs to top secret.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I have the right to review it, but it will be recorded..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was shocked and didn't expect that Felix's information was top secret. This meant that his identity was far more than just the chairman of the Red Umbrella Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne, if you really want to see it, I can help you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quentin didn't know why Alexander was interested in Felix, but for the sake of Scott's recovery, he had no choice but to do it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adam still said unconvincingly, "I don't believe in any witchcraft insects. He just relied on luck. How could he still have the nerve to ask for this and that. The Master I invited is the one who can be trusted..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Madison also agreed, "Yes, Uncle Adam is right. It was just a coincidence, not the credit of this guy."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Please stop talking!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brittany glared at them fiercely, feeling a little unbearable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander did not want to pay attention to them. Then, he took off his gemstone necklace, put it on Scott's neck, and solemnly warned, "This kind of witchcraft insects is very strange. It has both an energy body and a physical body. I carved an Esoteric Pattern on the yellow gemstone on this necklace, which can temporarily suppress the activities of the witchcraft insects.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I have destroyed the energy body of the witchcraft insect, and only the physical body is left. It will definitely go crazy. Therefore, before I come back, you must not take off the necklace. Otherwise, Mr. Scott Thompson will be in danger."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quentin and others were skeptical.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adam sneered contemptuously, his eyes rolling wildly, obviously having some bad intentions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm going to buy some materials to completely get rid of the witchcraft insect."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finishing saying that, Alexander turned and left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The room was in complete silence. No one had ever seen the witchcraft insects before. It was simply unbelievable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Alexander spoke very seriously, so Quentin dared not ignore it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The clock on the wall was ticking, and time passed by every second.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>An hour passed quickly, but Alexander did not come back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Scott lay on the bed with his eyes closed, motionless, and Quentin became more and more anxious as he waited.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Another half an hour passed, and there was still no sign of Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adam began to mock with schadenfreude, "Mr. Thompson, my judgment is definitely correct. That guy is a fraud. If this is really caused by some witchcraft insects, can't I detect it?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That guy knew he couldn't cure Mr. Scott Thompson and had no way to explain himself, so he ran away!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Madison sneered smugly, "Do you really believe what that guy said? We might as well throw away his broken necklace. Maybe he has bad intentions, and there is a curse on the necklace."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she said that, Madison was about to go up and take off the necklace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brittany quickly stopped her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Madison pouted unhappily, "Brittany, you are such a smart person, so how could you fall for such a trick? That guy obviously ran away and will never come back."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quentin snorted, "Who dares to take off the necklace? No one can do it without my permission!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's better to believe it than not to believe it. At least Alexander just made Scott sober. How do you explain it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Madison was left speechless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adam was even more unhappy. He came here to help Scott with his treatment in exchange for 50 million dollars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he couldn't cure Scott, he wouldn't get a penny, and he would have invited a dark wizard to come over for nothing, and Adam would have to pay the high fee.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Thompson, why did you invite me here since you don't trust me?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I am a wizard from the City of Sorcery. If it was the witchcraft insect, I would have cured it long ago with my ability. Why would that guy have to play tricks like that?"</span></p><div class="pagination">
