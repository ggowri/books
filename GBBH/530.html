  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Nancy is more than just playing DJing and bartending. I saw a few hooligans trying to bully her, but Nancy broke their hands."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Really?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I would die if I could have a romance with Nancy."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop daydreaming. I heard that Nancy doesn't like men. I've never seen her have a boyfriend."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you trying to discredit her on purpose?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two men started arguing. It got louder and louder. And finally, they started to fight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander couldn't help but ask, "Is the leader of the Kaylon really this Nancy? Is she so popular with men?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, few people know this secret. My grandfather told me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brittany guaranteed that Nancy was the leader of the Kaylon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, it was Alexander and Brittany's turn to enter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They walked into the bar. It was not very big. There was stimulating electronic music playing and a large group of men and women were dancing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Most of the men were absent-minded, looking towards the entrance of the corridor from time to time, hoping to see the charming and beautiful Nancy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Call Nancy out! I've been waiting for her for days, but she doesn't even show up. She's just a disc jockey."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm paying her one million dollars a month, plus a luxury car, to support her!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A burly bald man couldn't help it anymore, and strode towards the corridor at the back, shouting that he wanted to support Nancy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop! You can't go in the back."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Two security guards quickly reached out to stop him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man snorted, "Do you know who I am? I'm going in there today! Get out of my way, and I'll give each of you ten thousand dollars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I have plenty of money! Call Nancy out, or I'll have someone tear down the bar."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The guards said, "Sir, please calm down!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You can't go in there!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The bald man was tall and strong. He was able to fight two people alone and showed no weakness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander frowned and was about to take action, but was stopped by Brittany.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She said, "Don't worry. Wait until Nancy comes out."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this time, crisp footsteps sounded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was the sounds of the stiletto heels hitting the marble floor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone looked in the direction of the sounds. The mere sounds of footsteps made the bar quiet. And even the music stopped. The men were excited.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone was surprised to see Nancy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Many men fell in love with Nancy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy had long hair draped over her shoulders, smooth skin, delicate features, and a pair of beautiful eyes that were very alluring.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was wearing a half-white bra on her upper body, which made her breasts look conspicuous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her waist and perky butt twisted and turned, with a charming rhythm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy appeared under the light, and everyone gasped. She was so beautiful!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was like a piece of exquisite work of art, so perfect, without any flaws.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As long as a man took one look at her, he would be deeply obsessed with this beauty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Alexander, who was used to seeing beautiful women, couldn't help but be surprised.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing everyone's burning gazes, Nancy maintained a decent smile, but it had an aloof vibe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was even more dismissive of those men who cheered and drooled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The bald man swallowed and stared at Nancy's breasts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy didn't see Brittany and walked up to the bald man with a model's gait.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She said, "What do you want from me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Smelling an alluring fragrance, the bald man shivered violently with excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He felt that the beauty in front of him was like the sun, emitting a dazzling light that made him unable to look directly at her and feel ashamed of himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The bald man lost all his arrogance and trembled with nervousness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stammered, "I... I love you. Can you go out with me? I will give you any amount of money..."</span></p><div class="pagination">
