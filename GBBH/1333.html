  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The whole thing had really gotten under Julius's skin. The bruise to his ego was so bad it had actually driven him to start training at the Outer Court&mdash;something nobody had ever expected from a spoiled trust fund kid like him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander knew better than to make an enemy of the Marshall's son. Julius had some serious backing, and even his bodyguards were elite level-three warriors. Trying to defuse the situation, Alexander put on his most diplomatic smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Look, man, we're both students here now. Why don't we just let bygones be bygones?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julius's face darkened with rage. "Oh, NOW you want to play nice? Not gonna happen!" He turned to his thugs. "Baylor, Kenny, teach this smartass a lesson he won't forget!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Two men sprang into action beside Julius. The first was a towering mass of muscle with a bare chest, built like a heavyweight MMA fighter. His body radiated raw physical power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The second was a shifty-looking little guy with beady eyes, spinning two steel daggers with unsettling skill and speed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You really want to start trouble in the church?" Alexander shouted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd started gathering around them, buzzing with excitement. "Oh snap, fresh meat! Someone's got an attitude!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Another replied, "Hey kid, pay attention. This'll be educational..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The big guy let out a booming laugh. "Chill out, young man. I'm Baylor, and this is just some friendly sparring. Even Declan won't give me grief about it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The short guy, Kenny, snickered. "Tough luck, buddy. You picked a fight with Mr. Wetherall, and now you've gotta deal with me. Want to beg me to go easy on you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander felt his blood boiling. This wasn't going to end peacefully. He tossed his steel staff aside. "Bring it on! I'm not scared of either of you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Baylor's muscles tensed like coiled springs, radiating an intimidating sense that made the air feel heavy. With a battle cry, he launched himself forward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite his massive frame, he moved with shocking agility.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Like a panther, he twisted mid-air and threw a devastating hook. His fist, practically the size of a bowling ball, came rushing at Alexander's face with explosive force, the air literally cracking around it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smirked to himself. "A level-two warrior? Please. I've taken down the bronze warrior without breaking a sweat!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He dropped into a fighter's stance, channeling his energy with practiced precision. The Force within him began to spiral, flowing through his body like a coiled spring. In one fluid motion, he twisted his spine like a drawn bow, his arm becoming the arrow. His fist shot forward with devastating power, aimed straight at Baylor's chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Baylor barely registered the blur of movement before his ears caught the whistling sound of the incoming strike. Feeling the overwhelming force heading straight for his chest, he desperately shouted, "Iron Defense!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's strike landed square on Baylor's chest with the impact of a sledgehammer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Baylor's face flushed red as he countered, his muscled arms coiling like pythons before launching a brutal overhead strike at Alexander's head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But that wasn't all&mdash;behind Alexander, Kenny made his move. The short fighter's twin daggers sliced through the air in a deadly technique, aiming for Alexander's back and cutting off his escape routes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caught between a rock and a hard place&mdash;it looked like Alexander was about to get seriously messed up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julius's face broke into a smug grin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Alexander had an ace up his sleeve. Using an advanced Vardaanian yoga technique, he performed an impossible twist of his body, somehow slipping right into Baylor's guard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Force within him exploded into action, spiraling through his entire body. His training gear rippled with contained power as he executed a perfect shoulder strike straight into Baylor's chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The impact sent Baylor staggering backward, the color draining from his face as he stumbled three steps.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kenny's heart jumped into his throat when he saw Baylor take the hit. In a flash, he sprang into action, his movements fluid as water as he materialized behind Alexander. The steel dagger in his hand plunged downward, aiming straight for Alexander's neck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander let out a piercing battle cry. The Force spiraled through his body as he channeled his power. Three explosive bursts sent Kenny flying backward. In the same breath, Alexander launched himself toward Baylor, executing the third move of Muscle-Tendon Classic&mdash;Shifting Stars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Baylor's eyes went wide. Alexander moved like lightning, but there was something eerily graceful about it too, like watching a snowflake dance in a storm. It didn't make any sense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Baylor could even think about defending himself, Alexander's strike connected. The sickening crack of breaking ribs filled the air as blood sprayed from Baylor's mouth. The force sent him flying backward into the crowd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Useless!" Julius roared. "Take him down!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Three shadows detached themselves from the group, racing toward Alexander with deadly intent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kenny hesitated when he saw Baylor go down, his confidence wavering. But Julius's command steeled his nerves, and he pushed forward to rejoin the fight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The shout cut through the chaos. A young man in white emerged from the crowd, his golden-tipped spear glinting as he twirled it with expert precision.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Countless golden lights exploded from his spear like fireworks, forcing the crowd back. Sellers Schneier moved with Schneier Spear Technique, his spear dancing like a willow in a storm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The young man in white lowered his weapon and gave Julius a respectful nod. "Come on, Julius," he said calmly. "Ganging up on someone isn't exactly honorable for a fighter. Maybe cut us some slack?"</span></p><div class="pagination">
