  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Keith grinned proudly. He had once been like that security guard, only able to watch as others lived their wonderful lives.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was all thanks to Alexander's help that he had risen from the bottom of society to become a new star at Dragon Film and Television Company.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And then, many beautiful women, drawn by his title and abilities, had thrown themselves at him. That's how Keith had ended up with the wonderful life he now enjoyed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Therefore, he was grateful to Alexander and determined to find Hazel as soon as possible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Keith, don't be shy. Come on in and sit down. Make yourself at home," Paula said, opening the door and pulling him inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If Keith were the type of man desperate for a fling, he'd already have grabbed Paula and started kissing her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Keith wasn't in a hurry. He wanted to build up the atmosphere, making it so intense that Paula couldn't resist before he made his move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He knew that the more a man delays gratification with a woman, the more unforgettable it becomes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ms. Ortiz, is there something wrong with your plumbing?" Keith asked, pretending to be clueless, glancing seriously at the kitchen and bathroom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Oh, come on, we're already inside my home, and are you still playing dumb?" Paula teased, giving him a playful shove onto the sofa before sitting herself down on his lap.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Keith didn't resist, wrapping his arms around her as he asked, "Tell me, after your husband left, who was the man who left the biggest impression on you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Paula smirked and, with a bold laugh, began recounting her story.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After her husband's departure, Paula had to fend for herself and went out to find work.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At the time, she was working as the executive secretary at a well-known company.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The company was huge, offering excellent benefits, and the competition for the position was fierce.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The candidates were all graduates from prestigious universities or experienced professionals with impressive resumes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Paula, however, was just a housewife. She had little education and no real work experience.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>During the interview, Paula was desperate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>What she never expected was that the company's boss, Josiah Dixon, pointed straight at her and hired her on the spot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She thought it was a blessing from heaven, feeling overjoyed and swearing to herself that she would do her best to perform the job well and serve as Josiah's secretary.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Josiah, in his early forties, was in the prime of his life, but his temper was terrible, and he often scolded employees for the smallest things.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But he treated Paula with an exceptional amount of care, perhaps even a little too much.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Paula had her suspicions, but being a newcomer, she didn't dare to assume anything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When she first accompanied Josiah on a business trip, she stayed in a luxury suite of a five-star hotel for the first time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When Paula asked why Josiah had booked a suite, he explained it was for the convenience of work contact.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She didn't think much of it. After a nice dinner, the two of them went to their respective rooms to rest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the middle of the night, while Paula was sound asleep, she suddenly felt something heavy on top of her. She woke up with a start and saw that someone was lying beside her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Who's there?" she gasped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before she could scream, a hand clamped over her mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Shh... it's me," came the voice of Josiah.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Paula froze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She couldn't understand how Josiah had snuck into her room. Before she had time to react, Josiah had already torn open her nightgown and was on top of her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Paula, who had just lost her husband, naturally didn't want this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She struggled desperately, begging him to stop, but Josiah was strong as an ox, holding her down with one hand while stripping her naked with the other.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, Josiah raped her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He locked her in the suite for three whole days and nights, taking her repeatedly. Every part of her body was violated by Josiah.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At first, Paula fought back, but she hadn't had a man for a long time, and her body, which had already been awakened by her late husband, yearned for a physical connection.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Josiah was incredibly strong, and after her initial resistance, she gave in, at first only reluctantly, but eventually, she began to enjoy it, even eagerly responding to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Josiah was thrilled. He felt this secretary was definitely worth keeping.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>From that moment on, Paula became Josiah's mistress.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In fact, the "business trip" had been a setup. There was no business to discuss. The whole thing had been a plot to get Paula into bed.</span></p><div class="pagination">
