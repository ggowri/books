  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tsk..." That man sneered, and there was a hint of disdain and gloating in his eyes as he looked at Ian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Oldman was bound to kill them. We have already sent people to wait outside the Axe's territory for 24 hours. Come out, and they will be dead." After delivering this message, that man hurried away with the excuse that he had something else to do.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ian was left in the ward, and there was dead silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Facing such a depressing and heavy vibe, Ian looked at his broken leg with rage rising in his heart again, but the only thing he could do was to lie on the bed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, his cell phone rang.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At first sight of the number, he immediately picked the phone up with joy. "Paxton, you get to help me kill those bastards!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a brief silence over the phone, he heard Paxton's cold voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paxton said, "Ian, don't worry. I will make them pay for whatever they did to you! I am negotiating with other forces in the town to besiege the Axe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As long as the Axe is eliminated, the Mandale Town will be ours, and those bastards will never get away!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The battle will be launched in a few days. Besides, the Axe also controls several profitable mines. Ian, you get to keep your lips sealed, okay?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paxton sounded very excited.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Really? We can destroy the Axe with other organizations in town? I've been waiting for this day for too long!" Ian grinned grimly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As long as the Ave vanished, he thought he would definitely avenge himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, if they succeeded, the whole town would be under their control, and no one would dare to help his enemies by then.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As for Alyssa, we can fuck her until she knows how to bend down to men!" Paxton smiled sleazily with pride.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Great! And don't forget that bitch named Alice. I want her to lick my boots."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Imagining how he would avenge himself on whoever offended him, Ian felt much happier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My dear brother, you should have a good rest first and recover from your injuries. Don't worry about losing your legs anymore. Prosthetic limbs could suffice your needs to walk!" Paxton said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay, Paxton. Carry out your plan, my brother, and make sure you will destroy the Axe," Ian said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two brothers finished their enthusiastic chat and hung up the phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Axe and Alice! Just wait. I will make you suffer a fate worse than death!" Ian grinned like a devil.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, inside the Axe villa, Alexander, Alice, and Xavier had already enjoyed a sumptuous lunch and were chatting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Although we haven't found any top-grade gems yet, there is a batch of gemstones of good quality being delivered from the mines. I wonder if you're interested in picking some and cutting them. Maybe your luck will lead to what you want and an extra income!" Alyssa said with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nevertheless, it was just her suggestion. After all, it was like seeking a needle in the sea to hope that one could find top-grade gems among countless gem ores.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander said, "Really? Well, I actually made it not long ago, so why not give it a try this time?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Huh? You really just cut an ore and found a top-grade gem? Are you a connoisseur?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alyssa's eyes looked bright. Alexander surprised her again with his connoisseurship in </span><span>addition to his fighting skills.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, I think rest is the most important thing for you now. Please feel relieved to stay here. No one dares to touch you, not even the Mafia!" Alyssa patted her chest confidently, and her sexy breasts slightly shook with her action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her confidence came from the power of her gang.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We will stay here for a few days temporarily, but our main purpose is still the gems. As long as we can find the top-quality orange and purple gems, we will return to Los Angeles immediately."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alyssa waved her hand and said, "No problem. I can take you to the airport then."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When they were having a pleasant chat, Alyssa's phone rang,</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Excuse me," she said and answered the phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After hearing what the other side of her phone said, Alyssa's expression became extremely serious and grim. &#8203;Obviously, something bad had happened.</span></p><div class="pagination">
