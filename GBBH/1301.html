  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hezekiah swept his gaze over the crowd. For a fleeting moment, a trace of mockery flashed in his eyes, but it disappeared almost instantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing the words "death penalty" and "exile," Alexander felt his stomach drop. This was bad. Just then, a wave of heat pulsed through his chest, sending an indescribable sensation surging through his heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I will be grateful for everything God bestows upon me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well said."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hezekiah's eyes lit up as he looked at Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"With such devotion, you could never be a mere melon thief. Would you be willing to come to the church?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment he spoke, silence fell over the scene. Only the crackling of torches and the distant croaking of frogs broke the stillness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Logan, Donald, the lanky worker, the pockmarked laborer, and the rest of the onlookers all gaped in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander clutched his chest, his mind a complete blank. He had no idea why those words had come out of his mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, that was amazing! I've known you for so long, and I never realized you could talk like that!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Logan's eyes sparkled as he looked at Alexander with admiration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's expression shifted rapidly. He knew those words hadn't come from his own thoughts. He was certain now that he had traveled to a different world. But right now, survival was all that mattered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gritting his teeth, he pulled Logan down into a bow. "Sir, we would be honored!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hezekiah helped them to their feet. "Gentlemen, I was asking if you'd be willing to work as volunteers at the church."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Volunteers?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander froze. He had assumed the man was taking them in as disciples. Instead, he wanted them as laborers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Uh... do we get paid? Do we get days off?" Logan asked loudly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A hearty laugh burst from Hezekiah. "Yes, there's pay! This young man is quite straightforward."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words left the gathered crowd looking dejected. Donald's face turned an ugly shade of blue. He opened his mouth several times but ultimately held his tongue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ben, take these two to the Management Center and have them registered as laborers," Hezekiah instructed the friar holding the lantern behind him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, Head Priest Hezekiah."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ben Bonnekamp bowed to Alexander and Logan. "Gentlemen, please follow me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander didn't want to give anyone a chance to change their minds. He quickly bowed deeply to Hezekiah. "Thank you, sir!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grabbing Logan, he hurried after Ben toward the courtyard gate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hezekiah frowned as he glanced at Donald and the others, then let out a quiet sigh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I have other matters to attend to. I'll take my leave."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He took the reins of the blue lion held by a junior friar, swung a leg over its back, and sat cross-legged. With a soft command, "Go!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The lion tossed its thick mane, let out a low growl, and took off at full speed. In mere moments, Hezekiah and the lion vanished beyond the horizon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Alexander walked, he faintly heard Hezekiah's parting words. "A great calamity is coming. You must tread carefully." By the time he turned back, the old friar was gone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"These friars love being cryptic," Alexander thought, shaking his head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Something nagged at the back of his mind, something important he had forgotten.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Warrior... What does that mean again? Ava... Who is Ava?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His thoughts spiraled into confusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The blue-robed friar who had held the lion's reins bowed to Donald. "Donald, you should rest now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With his head held high, he strode into the courtyard and disappeared inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmph!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donald's eyes blazed with fury. He spun around and stormed inside as well, leaving the others standing in awkward silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander and Logan followed Ben into Dominion Church. The friar remained silent, and neither of them dared to speak, simply keeping their heads down as they walked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ben carried a small candlestick, but its light was bright, illuminating the path ahead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It felt like they had stepped into another world. Everything around them was unfamiliar, filled with sights they had never seen before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The path beneath their feet was made of smooth, pale pebbles, winding through a lush landscape of bamboo and towering trees. Scattered throughout the greenery were elegant pavilions and buildings, their windows glowing softly with warm light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The entire place radiated grandeur and solemnity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After about fifteen minutes, Ben led them to a grand estate. The mansion loomed high, its stone walls stretching dozens of yards into the sky. Above the entrance hung a massive plaque inscribed with three bold words: [Management Center.]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A wide flight of white stone steps led up to the gate, which stood open, spilling golden light into the night. Two enormous bronze lion statues flanked the entrance, their fierce expressions locked in an eternal snarl. Each held a pearl in its mouth, one paw resting atop an ornamental ball.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ben ascended the steps with measured strides, and Alexander and Logan followed closely behind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inside, the main hall was filled with rows of elegant hardwood tables, over a hundred of them. Behind each table sat a person, all seemingly engrossed in their work.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment Ben entered, they paused what they were doing, stood up, and greeted him respectfully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ben, good evening."</span></p><div class="pagination">
