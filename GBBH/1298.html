  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander! Alexander, wake up! Don't scare me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander struggled to open his eyes. Through the haze, he saw a boy about thirteen or fourteen years old staring at him with wide, anxious eyes. The boy had a round face, his small eyes filled with worry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander jolted awake. "Who are you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's me! We've turned into kids!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander studied the familiar chubby face. "You're... Logan?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He glanced down at himself. His clothes were suddenly two sizes too big, hanging loosely over his frame. He pulled his hands out from his oversized sleeves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment he saw them, he let out a startled yelp. "Are these even my hands?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why are they so small? They're soft and pale... These don't look like an adult's hands at all!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shaking his head, he tried to clear his thoughts and quickly got to his feet. This was beyond bizarre.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His clothes now fit him like a sack, but it wasn't the clothes that had changed. His body had shrunk. He looked like a teenager, no older than fifteen or sixteen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Logan scratched his head nervously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, weren't we just at the movies? One minute we were watching, and then your helmet malfunctioned and zapped us. Next thing I know, I wake up here... and I'm a kid!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander frowned and sighed. "Something feels off. Logan, where are we? Why is it so dark?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"See for yourself!" Logan nudged him and glanced around warily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What the hell..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander looked up. The night sky stretched above them, speckled with stars and a waning crescent moon. They stood in the middle of a farmland, surrounded by rows of watermelons.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The air was thick and humid. Even in short sleeves, sweat trickled down their backs. In the distance, flickering lights outlined what seemed to be a cluster of buildings, though the details were too blurry to make out. The tallest among them was a towering pagoda, its peak glowing faintly in shifting hues of seven colors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, what do we do?" Logan asked, looking dazed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander gritted his teeth. "I don't even know if we're still in Loscity!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The watermelons at their feet weren't very big, but they were perfectly round, releasing a faint sweet scent. Their dark green rinds gleamed under the night sky as if coated in a thin layer of luminescence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, let's just eat one first. I'm dying of thirst!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Logan, less concerned about their predicament, crouched down and started picking through the melons.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since it was too dark to see clearly, he resorted to tapping them one by one. Just as he plucked one from the vine, a crisp jingling sound echoed in the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Within seconds, the glow of torches flared in the distance, and a group of people came charging toward them. "Thieves! Catch the melon thieves!" someone bellowed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, crap! Are they talking about us?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Logan rolled his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's brow twitched. "Stay calm. Let's see how this plays out."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A dozen figures soon surrounded them, some wielding wooden clubs, others gripping torches.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leading the group was a young friar, wearing a yellow cap and a long red robe. Black leather boots covered his feet. His name was Donald Wachtell.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The rest of the men were dressed in simple, short-sleeved linen shirts, clearly laborers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The friar had a broad, fleshy face and eyes that burned with menace. He jabbed a finger at them. "You little thieves! Finally caught you in the act!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing how fierce the friar looked, Logan instinctively hid behind Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander, however, remained calm and asked in an even tone, "Sir, could you tell me where we are?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The friar's eyes widened in outrage. "Still playing dumb? Tie them up!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, Father Wachtell!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The workers surged forward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Logan tried to resist, but Alexander noticed a faint glow emanating from the friar's palm. His stomach clenched. He quickly grabbed Logan's arm. "Don't move!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's mind raced. He thought, "Even if this is some elaborate trick, no magic show could actually shrink people... And that glow...this guy may be dangerous. We shouldn't act rashly."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before they could do anything, the men tackled them to the ground. Their hands were yanked behind their backs, bound tightly with rough hemp ropes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ow! Hey, not so tight!" Logan yelped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander glanced down at the rope biting into his shoulders, his eyes darkening. He shot a cold look at the friar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A pockmarked worker leaned in close to the friar and muttered, "Father Wachtell, look at their strange clothes. And they're speaking some foreign tongue. These two must be runaway Risuneses slaves."</span></p><div class="pagination">
