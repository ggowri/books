  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>More than twenty bodyguards stepped out of the other Mercedes, all dressed in black suits and wearing sunglasses, exuding an intimidating presence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They scanned the area before striding toward Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ah! The leader and the family head are both here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Shirley, who was hosting the interview, jumped in surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After being hypnotized by Alexander, Shirley had stumbled out of the hall in a daze and only now regained full awareness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing Sean, the head of the Walsh family, and Norma, the leader of the Dragon Gang, both present, Shirley trembled in fear, unsure of what major event had occurred.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was just an interview; there was no need to involve both the family head and the gang leader.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Dragon Gang had always been under the Walsh family, with the head typically doubling as the leader.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But in this generation, things were different. Although Sean and Norma were cousins, their elders did not get along.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Both were equally powerful, so Sean became the head of the Walsh family, while Norma led the Dragon Gang.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The two maintained a delicate balance of power, often clashing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Tell them to clear out, get them all out of the way!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Shirley waved her baton, directing her subordinates to drive the hundreds of job applicants away to avoid blocking the path.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Who are those people? They look so imposing that even Shirley has to step aside for them."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You must be clueless; that's Sean Walsh, the head of the Walsh family, and Norma Walsh, the leader of the Dragon Gang."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What! It's those two powerhouses. What are they doing here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The scene erupted with chatter, excitement buzzing among both bystanders and applicants.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Figures of this caliber weren't people they could usually see up close.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander stood still, watching as they approached, his sharp gaze fixed on Sean and Norma.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Sean's face was slightly pale, his eyes shadowed with gloom and occasionally flashing with menace. His thin lips hinted at a ruthless nature.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Norma was young and stunning, dressed in a red, high-slit cheongsam that revealed her fair, shapely legs, with the slit hinting at the top of her thigh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Norma, why did you invite Alexander here? He took Devil Island from us. Why bring him here?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You made this decision without telling me first."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Sean's fierce gaze swept the area before settling on where Alexander stood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ha, what's wrong with me inviting him? The Sakra Society has been pressuring the Dragon Gang. Can't I find an ally?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Norma smiled at Alexander, her lovely face lighting up with a charming grin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Sean stared at Alexander as well, while the hundreds of applicants had been pushed aside, leaving Alexander standing proudly in place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Step aside!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Two oblivious men tried to shove Alexander aside but were sent flying by a slap from Marvin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Stop it, all of you! He is my guest, and you will show him respect," Norma commanded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Norma ordered, swaying gracefully as she approached Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Sean and the elderly man followed behind, their faces expressionless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marvin kept his eyes on the old man, feeling his heartbeat quicken uncontrollably.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He leaned toward Alexander and whispered, "Boss, that guy seems formidable. I'm feeling a sense of danger; be careful."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander simply gave a slight smile, his expression calm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon, Norma and her group stood before Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Sean spoke first. "Mr. Hawthorne, hello. I didn't expect you to be so young!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He carried himself with arrogance, eyes glancing sideways as if he didn't think much of Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander responded with a slight smile, neither humble nor arrogant. "You're not old yourself. Apologies for the sudden visit."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Sean waved dismissively. "I didn't invite you; Norma did without my approval."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His tone was unfriendly, emphasizing that Norma hadn't sought his approval, as if asserting dominance over her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander ignored him and gestured to Marvin. "This is my bodyguard, Marvin."</span></p><div class="pagination">
