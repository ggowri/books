  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lesly blushed and touched Alexander, saying, "Alexander, you're amazing!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander chuckled, pushing aside his desires to focus on the task at hand. Meanwhile, Aliza found a bunch of keys and opened a hidden compartment in the bookcase. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inside was a small safe where Guzman stashed his valuables.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I saw Guzman enter the password once. He must have thought I was just a stupid woman and wouldn't pay attention to it," Aliza said with a sly smile. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She inserted the key, entered the password in front of Alexander, and turned the handle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Click!" The heavy steel door swung open.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was impressed. He knew better than to underestimate anyone, especially cunning women like Aliza. Inside the safe were stacks of documents, several USB drives, cash, and a gold bank card.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The gold card caught Alexander's eye&mdash;it likely held Guzman's wealth. He took out his phone, opened the banking app, and entered the card number and safe's password. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To his surprise, he logged in successfully. Seeing the balance, he couldn't help but feel excited. It was a staggering $50 billion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Guzman, the notorious drug lord, had amassed billions in deposits alone. The documents revealed his vast asset holdings: properties in major cities worldwide, including manors, castles, and luxurious villas.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander estimated these properties were worth another $30 billion. Guzman had cleverly hidden these assets under anonymous ownership through a shell company. With the documents, Alexander could claim them all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Great job!" Alexander said, patting Aliza on the back with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aliza nestled into Alexander's arms, acting playfully. Alexander grinned, thinking, "Conquering a woman with money is superficial. True conquest lies in making her happy in bed."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aliza and Lesly didn't mind Alexander taking billions; they seemed thrilled, sharing in his success. They stayed close, pressing against him, reluctant to let go.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander focused on the safe, realizing he now controlled the Saint Group, the Brilliant Group, and Guzman's assets. He was wealthy beyond imagination.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You'll stay here on the island. I'll have Cloe ensure you're well taken care of. I'll visit when I can," Alexander said, patting their heads.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sisters looked reluctant but smartly refrained from stopping him. Alexander was relieved, thinking, "They know when to give space. Clinging would only push me away."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wouldn't let them leave Treasure Island or interfere with his life in </span><span>Loscity</span><span> with Ava. These beauties were destined to be kept safely away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Never thought I'd become a big shot," Alexander mused, brimming with confidence about the future.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Guzman in hiding and the Bryant family vanished, the Brilliant Group faced brief turmoil. However, Cloe quickly stabilized the situation. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for the Red Umbrella Group, Alexander wasn't ready to act without knowing the second brother's identity. He planned to have Cloe confront them, confident that the truth would eventually come out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before leaving, Alexander collected all the potential resources from the Brilliant Group. Once refined, Augusta and the others could use them to enhance their abilities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before departing, Alexander and Alice, accompanied by Cloe, visited the armory on the thirteenth underground floor of the trading center. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Alexander stepped out of the elevator, dozens of headlights automatically lit up, brightening the area like daylight.</span></p><div class="pagination">
