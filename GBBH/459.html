I didn't mean to peek... it's just, I couldn't help it..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander lifted her chin with one hand, while his other began undoing the buttons of her soaked lace blouse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Rebecca, you know, you </span><span>Azuran</span><span> girls really are something else. You're the wildest one by far."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's voice was teasing, laced with a hint of mockery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, Mr. Hawthorne, I'm not like this with anyone else... only you," Rosalia stammered, her voice full of urgency.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander unhooked her blouse and the bra beneath, letting them drop away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her full chest bounced slightly, water glistening on her skin, utterly captivating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Like what you see, Boss?
