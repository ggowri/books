  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this time, Alice, who was listening outside, blushed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't expect that just one phone call from Alexander would make the head of the Hansen family come to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If this news went out, it would cause a sensation in the entire </span><span>Loscity</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ever since Alexander killed Guzman, Alice felt that Alexander would win the position of Godfather, and now she had more confidence in Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the study, Rebecca was completely relaxed, and her gentle moans could be heard throughout the entire villa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alice felt hot all over, and her lower body became wet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It turns out Mr. Hawthorne is a pervert!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the sounds coming from the room became more and more exaggerated and seductive, Alice couldn't help it anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nearly two hours passed before Rebecca left with a red face and unsteady steps. She was exhausted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was in high spirits and full of energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Due to the dedication of Alice and Rebecca, Alexander finally accumulated the Force to its peak state, and the time to forge Lightsabers had come.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander said in a serious tone, "I'm going to stay in the basement for three days. If </span><span>anything</span><span> major happens during these three days, you can discuss it with the Hansen family, the Federer family, and Ultimate Alliance. They will all cooperate with you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alice was shocked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She already knew about the relationship between Rebecca and Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the Federer family, especially Ultimate Alliance, was also controlled by Alexander. Alice found it unbelievable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ultimate Alliance was built on the former Wolf Gang and had absorbed the Fraternity, the Cripples, and the Blood Gang in </span><span>Loscity</span><span>, becoming the largest and most powerful gang in </span><span>Loscity</span><span> today.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smiled slightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Because I'm forming a private force, which is not recognized, so I didn't tell you before."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alice's face changed, and she made a solemn promise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne, rest assured. I will keep the secret. Even if I die in these three days, I will die here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander nodded with satisfaction, hugged her in his arms, and kissed her, then walked into the basement without looking back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alice looked at Alexander's back as if she saw her future godfather and her eyes were filled with tears of excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander locked the door and took out all the materials needed to make Lightsabers, including the most important energy core.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Rutherford, I am finally going to start making my Lightsabers. I hope your soul in heaven can rest in peace."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander prayed devoutly for a while and then began to forge Lightsabers...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the headquarters of Red Umbrella Group in </span><span>Loscity</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane knelt in front of Felix, trembling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Vanderbilt, please save us... Alexander has put my father in jail and burned down our house..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix snorted contemptuously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said calmly, "The deadline is almost up. If you don't send your daughter here, be prepared to pay a billion dollars in compensation."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah! Mr. Vanderbilt, can you please give me a few days? Alexander has arranged bodyguards around Ashley, and I can't get close to her at all."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane started to cry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Waste! Your whole family is a waste!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix picked up the cup and smashed it to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The hot coffee splashed onto Jane, scalding her and making her scream.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come here, take her away, along with all the people from the Fairfax family, and lock them all up in the dungeon."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix ordered, and Jane was immediately controlled by several strong men.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane's face changed drastically, and she screamed in horror.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Vanderbilt, what are you doing? Aren't we going to deal with Alexander together?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix smiled evilly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You all from the Fairfax family are all useless. You disappoint me so much! Since you have taken my money, you should help me to the end. After all, you have a relationship with Alexander. You and Ashley can both be my bargaining chips."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane felt like she was struck by lightning, and her head was buzzing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix roared, "Drag her away!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane was dragged out crying and wailing by several big men and locked up in the dungeon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this time, a middle-aged man came out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said with a smile, "Felix, don't get angry over such a small matter. I'll just kill Alexander myself and put an end to it. There's no need to catch that brat, it's troublesome."</span></p><div class="pagination">
