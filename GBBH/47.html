  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander grunted softly as Betty, overcome with emotion, pushed him back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Boss, I'd walk through fire for you. Please, I'm begging you to help me..." Betty pleaded desperately.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander's hands supported her butts, his hands filled with her tender flesh that was smooth and desirable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Betty straddled him like a knight, and soon, the villa echoed with her excited and content singing...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A full hour passed before the storm finally subsided.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Betty had wholly surrendered to Alexander, nestled in his arms like a delicate songbird. Her beautiful face radiated the blissful contentment of satisfaction.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander's power overwhelmed her completely, mind and body alike.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His mastery of The Force made him incredibly formidable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A woman's total submission to a man encompasses both heart and flesh.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The unprecedented ecstasy Betty had just experienced was seared into her very soul, and it was unforgettable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander caressed the lovely woman's body as he questioned her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What kind of man is Guzman really? Does anyone know his exact whereabouts?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Betty furrowed her brow and shook her head.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I've never met him. Even when he calls, it's always from untraceable numbers. I have no clue where he's calling from.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Guzman is highly cautious. He doesn't trust anyone except his cousin, Sebastian Tate...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Oh! I just remembered! Sebastian has an illegitimate son, Theodore Tate. He's on his way to Loscity."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander's eyes lit up instantly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Good. The moment Theodore arrives in Loscity, notify me immediately. Find a way to extract Guzman's whereabouts from him."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes, sir!" Betty promptly agreed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She rolled on top of Alexander, her tongue skillfully and deftly kissing him, helping to clean him up...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After a while, Alexander finally left, feeling refreshed and invigorated.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'm off. Keep in touch with me directly; don't go through anyone else."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After giving Betty these final instructions, he picked up the bodies of those two unfortunate Kaylon goons and headed to the back garden.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When The Force ignited on the corpses, it took only a few wisps of smoke before the two bodies visibly disintegrated into ashes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Betty covered her mouth in shock, her beautiful eyes wide as saucers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander's mystery and power deeply shook her to the core, further boosting her loyalty.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At the Saint Tower, at this very moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava waited anxiously for Alexander's return.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nearly two hours had passed, and Alexander remained unreachable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She wanted to consult the chairman on how to handle the conflict with the Cripples, but he wasn't picking up Anne's phone. She had no idea what was going on with the chairman.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Most of the guests had already hurried out long ago.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Unexpectedly, Oscar returned. In the vast expanse of the Saint Tower, aside from hundreds of security guards, only Ava and Oscar remained.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Oscar said with a forced smile, "Ms. Blackburn, my people have thoroughly investigated. The hitmen most likely came from the Brilliant Group.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If I'm not mistaken, the Saint Group's new chairman must be the Godfather's third son. The battle for the Godfather's inheritance has begun."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Oscar's old eyes gleamed with excitement.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Saint Group has also offended the Cripples tonight. Add the Brilliant Group to that mix, and you're in for a world of trouble."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His words carried hidden meanings, his eyes narrowing into sly slits like a cunning old fox.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava pondered for a moment before responding coolly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Thanks for your concern, Sir Stewart. The Kaylon and the Brilliant Group have always been mortal enemies. I take it you're looking to form an alliance with us at Saint Group."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Oscar clapped his hands excitedly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Sharp as ever, Ms. Blackburn! I've been wanting to team up with Saint Group for a while, but you mentioned Guzman is Godfather's eldest son.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Now that the Brilliant Group's hired guns are gunning for you, it's clear Guzman wants to take you out, clearing the path to secure his inheritance."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava remained deep in thought. She needed to get in touch with Anne and find out if the new chairman was really Godfather's third son and if a succession war was brewing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Seeing Ava's hesitation, Oscar grew impatient and started pressing for an answer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just then, Alexander's magnetic voice cut through the tension.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Sir Stewart, you might want to dial it back a notch. All that excitement could fry more of your neurons and bring on early-onset Parkinson's."</p><div class="pagination">
