  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey there! I'm Sophie Pepys. Wishing you both all the happiness!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sophie stepped up next, officially recognizing Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gill wasn't exactly in her right mind, so everyone ignored her ramblings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Sophie was different; even though she was younger, she carried some weight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thanks," Nancy replied, clearly surprised. Their relationship hadn't always been great.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Who would have thought her sister would openly support her today?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In truth, Sophie's change of heart was also about her own future.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If even the favored daughter had to make sacrifices, then she, the less favored second daughter, might end up marrying someone important for the family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every woman </span><span>dreams</span><span> of her Prince Charming and a happy marriage, so accepting family plans can be tough.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Plus, Sophie had always felt resentment toward her father, which made her stand firmly by Nancy today.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander glanced at Sophie, then quickly looked away, showing no interest at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sophie was taken aback; she didn't expect this handsome man to be so decent, not ogling her like other men.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Compared to that creepy Clay, Alexander's gaze was refreshingly clear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sophie felt a mix of emotions; such men were rare, and she suddenly envied Nancy even more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, Luther erupted, "Nancy, what are you bringing this guy home for? I only recognize Clay; I won't acknowledge this punk!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Have I spoiled you too much? You've become so bold, causing a scene at Grandpa's birthday party. How could you do this to us?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy huffed back, "If anyone wants to marry Clay, go ahead; I'll support it with both hands."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clay shook with anger, fists clenched tight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Richard tried to calm him. "Don't worry, Clay. We won't acknowledge anyone but you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clay gritted his teeth, feeling utterly humiliated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, I want you dead!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He truly wanted to lash out first, to strike hard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Clay held back; the more intense the moment, the more he needed to keep his cool.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No matter what, he had to secure Nancy first. Once he did, even the Kaylon would be his. A mere Alexander wouldn't pose a threat then.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clay put on a sorrowful face, wiping his eyes as he said, "Grandpa Richard, I can't believe Nancy would say that. This guy must be threatening her; someone needs to grab him now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you let this slide, how can I hold my head high? The reputation of the City of Sorcery is at stake! Mr. Rossetti will be furious, and the Reynolds family will face the wrath!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clay hid his malice behind a smile, making Richard's expression grow even darker.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Pfft!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gill suddenly spat at Clay. "You think you can marry my Nancy? Dream on!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shut up!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Richard couldn't hold back his anger any longer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy stood her ground, shouting, "Grandpa, don't push me. You'd be breaking the law. If you insist, I might just resign as the master of the Kaylon and take you to court."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Richard was so furious he nearly stumbled, speechless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you two already together?" Luther couldn't help but ask.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Knowing his daughter well, he was aware that Nancy had never been keen on men and had never had a proper boyfriend.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, seeing Nancy and Alexander so close, it was clear their relationship had crossed into deeper territory.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy felt her face flush, recalling that night in the bar, how she had leaned into Alexander's embrace, feeling electrified.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, we're together now. I really love him," Nancy declared firmly, and everyone could tell she wasn't lying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Reynolds family began murmuring among themselves, exchanging glances.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You! You're the eldest daughter of the Reynolds, the boss of the Kaylon! How can you act so casually?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luther pointed a shaking finger at his daughter, fuming with rage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, someone suggested, "Since Nancy really doesn't want Clay, why not let Sophie marry him? She doesn't have a boyfriend yet."</span></p><div class="pagination">
