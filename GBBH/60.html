  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander ignored Vincent and put his hand on Oscar's forehead, using the Force to heal him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Oscar instantly froze.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Vincent watched nervously, feeling very conflicted. He hoped that Alexander could cure his grandfather, but at the same time, he also wished Alexander would fail so that he could ridicule him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At this moment, Oscar felt as if his whole body was wrapped in a warm current, and he felt relaxed all over.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His stiff muscles softened, and his hands stopped shaking.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Oscar even sat up from the stretcher unconsciously, his eyes wide open and bright.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"We're almost there. That's it for today. I have to go to the hospital to see my daughter."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander withdrew his hand and sped away in his old Toyota.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He didn't have a good opinion of Oscar. If it weren't for the alliance and Ava, Alexander wouldn't have bothered to consume the Force to cure Oscar.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Oscar was stunned for a while before he came back to his senses. He was surprised to find that everything had returned to normal as if nothing had happened.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Grandpa, how do you feel?" Vincent asked nervously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Oscar got down from the stretcher swiftly and even jumped a bit, getting excited.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'm cured. I've recovered."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Everyone was shocked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Parkinson's disease was incurable and could only be relieved by medication, which didn't have such a good effect.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Vincent couldn't believe it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Is this guy a doctor? How could he do that?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Someone reminded, "Sir Stewart, could it be that Alexander poisoned you? Otherwise, how could he have predicted all this and helped you recover so easily?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Oscar got angry and slapped him hard in the face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What an idiot! You're still trying to sow discord at this time."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I have to count on him for treatment. Didn't you hear that the treatment would take at least a year? I have to see him once a month."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Vincent frowned and said, "Grandpa, aren't you being controlled by Alexander in that way?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Oscar pulled a long face and didn't reply. The others fell silent. Everyone was in a low mood.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After a while, Oscar sighed. "Alexander impressed me. Ava said that given a month, he could suppress the Brilliant Group and the Cripples. Now it seems possible..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Oscar had a completely different opinion of Alexander now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Vincent was annoyed with the relationship between Alexander and Ava.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Grandpa, I don't think it's so simple. If the Saint Group beats all the enemies on its own, it will make it difficult for the Kaylon to gain a foothold in Loscity."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Oscar was silent for a moment and waved his hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Alexander is indeed very mysterious. We can only make friends with him, not offend him."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Isn't he looking for top-quality yellow gemstone? Send our people to collect it immediately at a high price and report to me as soon as there's any news."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes, Sir Stewart," the people from the Kaylon answered weakly, feeling aggrieved.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Oscar sighed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Vincent, don't ever think of meeting Ava from now on. Don't offend Alexander."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Grandpa, I..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Vincent was unwilling to give in.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Don't say any more. Do you want me to get Parkinson's disease again?" Oscar interrupted him directly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Vincent felt reluctant and distressed. Ava's beautiful figure seemed to be getting farther and farther away from him and disappeared...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the intensive care unit of the hospital.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After visiting his daughter, Alexander arranged for William to protect her in secret.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">There were the bodyguards and medical experts sent by Anne, who said that Frank had issued an order that no one was allowed to hurt Ashley, so Alexander was not worried.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">On the way back home, Alexander couldn't help thinking.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Guzman was elusive and difficult to deal with. It would be difficult to complete the mission by annexing the Brilliant Group.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Moreover, Guzman was not the only enemy. There was Anthony, who had been watching the show on the side. Alexander didn't know what was on his mind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Therefore, he should have a backup plan.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">William, Billy, and Betty made his basic team. If he wanted to have more hands, he had to get some money.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His father, whom he hadn't met yet, wouldn't agree to help him build up his team with the strength of the Saint Group.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander was thinking in the room, and suddenly, he thought of the magic powder in the Ultimate Legacy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The recipe for this mysterious potion came from an ancient wizard.</p><div class="pagination">
