  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Three more days passed before the relentless rain finally stopped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander left Sally behind in the air-raid shelter and drove away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sally stood outside the heavy iron door, staring blankly as his car disappeared into the distance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander glanced at the rearview mirror and smiled faintly. He knew that as long as he could catch Yinson, he could put an end to this catastrophe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He drove to the other side of Kylaville, heading toward the Dragon Gang's headquarters.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, he spotted something unusual.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the distance, there was a massive underground entrance. Vehicles moved in and out freely, and strangely, there were no zombies or mutant beasts anywhere near it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Could this be Yinson's secret base?" he wondered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Excitement surged through him. He parked his car at a safe distance and waited until nightfall before silently making his way toward the underground facility.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The perimeter was heavily guarded, with both open and hidden sentries and heavy weapon emplacements.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Armed soldiers patrolled back and forth. Moving like a shadow, Alexander found a ventilation duct, pried open the cover, and slipped inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bastard! How dare you sleep here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A furious voice rang out, followed by the sharp crack of a slap.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A hand smacked hard across Alexander's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He jolted awake, staring in confusion at the stunning woman in front of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her breathtaking features were twisted in anger. She wore nothing but a torn black silk nightgown, draped loosely over her body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her skin was marked with red welts and faint bruises.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was clear evidence of someone's rough treatment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander blinked in bewilderment. "Who... are you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shameless scum!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was livid. Another slap landed on his face, leaving a matching print on his other cheek.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now he was fully awake. But his mind was a complete blank. He had no idea what was happening.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Something felt terribly wrong.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I forgot something... Something really important!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He struggled to grasp the missing pieces. "I was the last Warrior, wasn't I? I infiltrated the underground base... So how did I end up here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Panic set in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, another set of memories surged into his mind. He realized he was just a delivery guy. Also named Alexander. An hour ago, he had accepted an order and eagerly set off to complete it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The order read: [Deliver one bottle of Lafite wine to Moon Bay Villas, Kylaville. Tip: 100 dollars.]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moon Bay Villas was an exclusive neighborhood for the wealthy. It was no surprise that its residents drank expensive wine and tipped generously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Right now, he needed the money desperately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was an intern at Healiva Hospital, drowning in student debt, so he had taken up a side job delivering food and goods.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "Did I develop a split personality?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Am I losing my mind? Was the Warrior... Ava... Godfather... all just a dream?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shock and doubt flooded his heart. The thought unsettled him deeply.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he arrived at the villa, the front gate opened, and a young woman stepped out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wore a black leather miniskirt that showed off her long legs, her full chest straining against her tight top. Though her face was merely above average, her outfit pushed her attractiveness up a notch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What are you looking at? Never seen a woman before?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She rolled her eyes at him, snatching the shopping bag out of his hands with an air of disdain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander felt a little embarrassed. He hadn't meant to stare, but he had instinctively taken an extra glance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmph! A mere delivery guy dares to look at me? Know your place."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her voice dripped with contempt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Annoyed, Alexander thought, "You dress like that because you want people to look."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But money was money. He still had a loan to pay off, and a hundred bucks was a hundred bucks. He let it slide.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Turning away, he strode toward his scooter, ready to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then he froze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The woman had taken the shopping bag but didn't go inside. Instead, she pulled out a syringe and hastily inserted it into the bottle's cap.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's instincts screamed that something was off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His impression of her sank even lower.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Maris, is the wine here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A sweet, seductive voice called out from inside the house.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, it's here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maris Becker answered hurriedly, tossing the syringe into a patch of grass before rushing inside and slamming the door shut.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Curiosity piqued, Alexander quickly walked over to the bushes and searched.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He soon found the syringe, still containing a few lingering drops of liquid.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Bringing it close to his nose, he sniffed. Then, his expression darkened instantly. He could tell the syringe contained a strong anesthetic.</span></p><div class="pagination">
