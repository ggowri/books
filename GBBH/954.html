  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an unexpected turn, Grace, usually so proud and headstrong, lowered her head to Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne, if you can save my grandpa, I'll do anything you ask."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She met his gaze with a bold, unwavering look.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander studied her for a moment, sensing her innocence and sincerity. After a pause, he gave a small nod.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I might be able to help your grandfather."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Really? You can actually fix him?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grace's heart skipped a beat, her chest rising and falling as excitement took over her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander gave a faint smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't make promises I can't keep, but treating your grandfather's injuries will drain a lot of my energy. It's not a small favor."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, those bodyguards got up from the ground and spoke in unison, "Mr. </span><span>Hawthorne, we apologize for our rashness. Please, we beg you. Help Mr. Lawson!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their voices were filled with genuine desperation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gavin's eyes were full of hope, his gaze never leaving Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander thought for a moment. Saving Gavin would work in his favor, considering the man's status.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was a powerful figure in </span><span>Avalora</span><span> and a key player in the Ghost.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, I'll give it a try."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He moved to Gavin's side, took a deep breath, and focused.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a few precise taps on the older man's chest, a powerful surge of force flowed into him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Alexander's force worked its magic, Gavin's coughing stopped almost instantly, and his pale face began to regain some color.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm not coughing anymore! I'm better!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gavin was stunned, touching his chest in disbelief. The pain was gone, and he felt like a weight had been lifted from him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne, you're a true savior!" Gavin said, his voice thick with gratitude.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry, if anyone from the Ghost gives you trouble, I'll make sure to handle it. I'll do everything I can!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grace was equally overwhelmed, her face flushed with emotion as she looked at Alexander, her eyes filled with admiration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite her quick temper, she was a kind-hearted person. Otherwise, she wouldn't have begged him so earnestly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smiled and raised a hand, signaling for them to hold off on the thanks. "Don't get ahead of yourselves. I've only temporarily halted the flare-up of his injuries. He's not fully healed yet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The root cause is still there. He should be fine for the next three months, but for a full recovery, I'll need to find some special herbs and do a more thorough treatment."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne, you've truly saved my life. I can never repay you for this."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gavin's voice was thick with emotion, and he bowed deeply in gratitude.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander gave a knowing smile. "You'll need to come back in three months for more treatment, or the problem will resurface. But if I find the right herbs, I can guarantee a full recovery."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you! I'll be forever grateful!" Gavin responded, bowing again, his gratitude clear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew that Alexander might be using this as leverage to control him, but at this point, he had no choice. Even if Alexander wasn't entirely truthful, he had to trust him if he wanted to keep his life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gavin turned to </span><span>Grace,</span><span> his tone serious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Grace, tell everyone in the Ghost. Anyone who dares harm Mr. Hawthorne will become our enemy. We will stop at nothing to protect him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, Grandpa."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grace's eyes flashed with determination.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry, Grandpa. If anyone dares to cross Mr. Hawthorne, they're going up against us! I'll make sure they know what they're getting into."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander glanced at his watch, then turned to leave. "I've got other matters to attend to. Let's stay in touch."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he walked away, his movements graceful and confident, as though every step was deliberate and effortless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He's so handsome..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grace watched his retreating figure, her cheeks burning as her heart raced.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't even realize that a woman's initial attraction to a man had begun to stir within her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gavin sighed </span><span>deeply,</span><span> his tone reflective.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander is impressive. Both his skills and his medical abilities are on par with, if not better than, Asher, our country's top talent."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The people around him were clearly taken aback, especially Grace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gavin looked at his granddaughter, who was staring after Alexander with wide eyes, and his expression turned more thoughtful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sweetheart, don't forget. You're already promised to Asher."</span></p><div class="pagination">
