  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lily quickly presented the gift with both hands, smiling obsequiously as she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Jane, I'm here on behalf of Alexander to deliver this gift and congratulate Mr. Hawkins on becoming the Vice President of the Saint Group. Please, be generous and don't hold any grudge against Alexander."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The many guests curiously glanced at Lily, whispering among themselves.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jane sneered. "Alexander sent you, didn't he? Wasn't he the one who was so stubborn? Now he's finally scared?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ryan grinned with satisfaction.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Alexander used to boast and show off in front of me. Now he realizes it's too late to be scared!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"When I officially become Vice President, I'll make sure Alexander is blacklisted in Loscity. Anyone who dares to hire him or help him will be my enemy."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lily was terrified, trembling uncontrollably as she pleaded sincerely. "Jane, Mr. Hawkins, I apologize on behalf of Alexander. Please, I beg you not to hold this against him."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ryan, growing impatient, shouted, "It's too late!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He then grabbed the gift from Lily and violently threw it at her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You old hag, who told you to come here? Do you think this is a place for you? Get out!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lily, being sixty years old, couldn't withstand Ryan's sudden attack.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She screamed as she tumbled down the steps, crushing the fruit and pastries she had brought and breaking her leg.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lily fainted from the pain as Ryan waved his hand dismissively.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Idiot. Did she think some fruit and pastries would win me over? This was clearly one of Alexander's tricks to embarrass me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Why are you all standing around? Get her out of here! She fell on her own. It has nothing to do with me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A few bodyguards quickly carried Lily out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The guests who witnessed the scene couldn't help but think Ryan was truly malicious.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But no one dared to say a word of justice. Ryan was about to become the Vice President of the Saint Group. No one was willing to risk offending him and compromising their family's interests over someone insignificant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When Alexander learned of Lily's injury, he rushed to the hospital immediately.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lily lay on the hospital bed, her face pale, with a cast on her right leg.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When Alexander saw this, his heart ached.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Since his mother's passing, Lily had become like a mother to him, a debt of gratitude he could never repay.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Alexander, I'm fine. I just fell by accident."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lily said with a comforting smile, though tears were clearly glistening in her eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander's expression grew serious.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Lily, don't worry. I'll make Ryan pay a hundredfold for this!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lily wiped her tears and waved her hand, trying to dissuade him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Alexander, let it go. They have money and power. We can't fight them... Punishing the wicked is God's work. We must learn to forgive."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander had a cruel smile as a cold glint flashed in his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Lily, you are right. God won't forgive any evildoer!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After visiting Lily, Alexander went to Ashley's hospital room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">From the moment he entered the corridor to the door of Ashley's room, both sides were lined with black-suited bodyguards, the atmosphere tense.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Every patient in the surrounding wards had been cleared out, leaving only the intensive care unit at the end of the hall.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Several medical staff stood guard, constantly monitoring Ashley's condition, a stark contrast to her previous treatment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Good day, Mr. Hawthorne!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Anne bowed to Alexander.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Seeing Anne personally on guard, Alexander nodded approvingly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You've done well. Everything is well arranged."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Anne's beautiful face brightened with a smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Even though the Godfather has ordered Mr. Augustine Hawthorne and Mr. Anthony Hawthorne not to touch Ms. Hawthorne, we must remain vigilant."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As Anne spoke, Alexander watched her micro-expressions closely, using the Force to sense any changes in her heartbeat or body temperature.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A Warrior's strength was unimaginable to ordinary people. Alexander could detect whether Anne was hiding something or lying.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If Anne had any ulterior motives or was hiding anything, it would surely show.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">One must always be cautious, especially when dealing with someone as crucial as Anne, his most trusted assistant at the moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Anne passed the test smoothly, and Alexander, reassured of her loyalty, was completely at ease.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just then, Anne frowned and said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mr. Hawthorne, Ryan and Jane went too far. Should we teach them a lesson now?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander's eyes narrowed, a fierce light shining through.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No rush. In two days, when they attend the ball, I'll make sure Ryan pays for his crimes in front of everyone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Prepare a coffin, tailor-made for Ryan, and have it ready overnight."</p><div class="pagination">
