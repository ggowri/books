  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon, the ambulance and police cars arrived.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What happened? Have you found any clues about the killer? Where did he go?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"A bunch of useless idiots, not a single lead!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Oliver barked at his subordinates.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The audacity of the killer was beyond belief&mdash;he not only attempted to assassinate the sheriff but caused a massive explosion that humiliated Oliver, the head of the police station. There was no way to save face now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The officers stood silent, too afraid to speak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Forget it, calm down..." Alexander intervened with a calm smile. "It's not really their fault... After all, even I couldn't catch the killer."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Oliver sighed, exasperated, and waved his men off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The officers shot Alexander a grateful look before quickly scattering.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne, is this killer really from the Sakura Society? I can't believe after all the international crackdowns, they still have this kind of power left."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Oliver mused, shaken.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander sneered, "Don't worry. That killer won't last much longer."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Oliver nodded, a bit relieved. "We're lucky to have you on our side, Mr. Hawthorne. Without your help, we'd never be able to handle someone as ruthless as him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When Alexander returned to the police station, Melin was waiting anxiously for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Alexander, are you okay?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She rushed to him as soon as she saw him, scanning him carefully for any signs of injury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When she found none, her breath finally relaxed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'm fine, but that old bastard got away."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander smiled faintly, trying to lighten the mood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You've been at it all night. You must be starving. Come sit down. I'll make you some spaghetti."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Melin quickly went to work, moving with a natural tenderness&mdash;like a loving wife.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander glanced at the clock; it was already past midnight. He was hungry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Melin not only made spaghetti but also two small side dishes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You've had a long night too. Come, let's eat together."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She urged him to sit down, and they shared the meal quietly, the only sound in the room being the clink of utensils.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>There was a warmth in the air, unspoken, yet tangible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander ate without looking up, but he could feel Melin's gaze on him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What are you staring at? Is there something on my face? Come on, eat!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He chuckled, picking up a piece of meat and putting it in her bowl.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Thanks."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Melin smiled back at him, their eyes meeting in a silent exchange that said more than words could.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After finishing his meal, Alexander stood up to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Suddenly, Melin grabbed his arm and whispered, "Will you stay tonight?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>For a moment, Alexander hesitated, a trace of guilt flickering across his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Don't worry. That old bastard's seriously wounded. He won't be back. I just need to check on my family... in case something's happened."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The moment he mentioned his family, Melin's expression fell. She knew exactly who he meant&mdash;Ava.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Of course... You'll be gone when the sun comes up, won't you? Just like all those fleeting moments..." Melin thought to herself, a pang of sadness in her chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander had already taken a step toward the door but paused. He turned back, giving her a reassuring smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'll find him, Melin. I promise."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Thank you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her voice barely above a whisper, Melin nodded, her eyes heavy with emotion. She softly closed the door behind him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As Alexander left, he could see the sorrow in her eyes, and a sigh escaped him. His mind was far from clear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The faces of several women swirled in his thoughts, each pulling him in a different direction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the cab on his way home, Alexander couldn't shake the feeling that something wasn't right. The driver was acting strangely, glancing back at him through the rearview mirror a little too often.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>That sudden, unsettling sense of danger washed over him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Real experts, those who had faced death time and again, could feel these shifts in the air&mdash;the danger that was about to unfold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As a seasoned Warrior, Alexander had honed this instinct.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The driver was definitely suspicious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander caught the driver's gaze in the mirror. Their eyes locked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What are you looking at?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A cold chill ran through Alexander's voice as he asked, his tone laced with warning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I... I wasn't looking at anything."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The driver's voice cracked, and his grip tightened on the steering wheel. His expression twisted into something unnatural.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Heh. You're with the Sakra Society, aren't you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander's voice was calm but laced with deadly intent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The driver's face turned pale. In an instant, he jerked the wheel sharply.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Bang!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The taxi slammed into a roadside flower bed, the violent force sending the car into a spin. It flipped once in the air before crashing violently back onto the road.</span></p><div class="pagination">
