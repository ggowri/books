  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The police officers were unharmed and had the upper hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The remaining enemies had no desire to fight. And with Alexander's attack, they would soon win.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When the last enemy fell, Melin and others happily put down their guns and surrounded Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Be careful! Go to the elevator first. I'll cover you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander discovered something was wrong.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had heard some unusual noises, rapidly approaching from far away. Something </span><span>was coming out of the undamaged glass jars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "Another living dead?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As a chaotic sound of footsteps sounded, Alexander had a bad premonition.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said, "Go away. I can protect myself!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander pushed Melin into the elevator and urged them to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melin and others were stunned, not knowing why Alexander suddenly behaved like this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Alexander's expression was serious. Melin didn't ask in the end. Instead, she hugged Alexander and kissed him before leaving with other police officers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Several shrill screams were heard from the corner of the corridor, obviously coming from people in the base.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Something was killing people on the base!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Accompanied by a low growl, a group of zombies with highly decayed bodies and red eyes slowly turned the corner.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as they saw Alexander, they pounced on him like hungry wolves at a fast speed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander saw that they were no longer human, but zombies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each one of them looked like a ghost, quite terrifying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Behind them, there was a zombie with a black body and long fingernails that were as sharp as blades.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under the command of the living dead, these zombies have surrounded Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the eyes of these zombies, Alexander was delicious food.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander sneered contemptuously. They were indeed some brainless monsters who dared to surround him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He swung his sword and rushed towards them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Lightsaber was swung, and white sword beams flashed, cutting through the monsters effortlessly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These monsters had no sense of pain, were fearless and had only appetite. They were no match for Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, they turned into fragments.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The only thing that surprised Alexander was that the living dead could command zombies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't help but think of Jake who was far away in the suburbs of </span><span>Loscity</span><span>. Jake had several living dead under his command, enough to control a small zombie army.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was worried about Ava and Ashley, so he acted faster and more ruthlessly, chopping the zombies hiding at the back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The body parts mixed with black blood on the ground looked like immortal maggots, shaking and wriggling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was also a zombie head that opened its mouth towards Alexander, as if it wanted to bite his foot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander didn't even look at it and crushed it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, things did not end. As more than a dozen zombies rushed out from deep within the base.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Some of them were wearing researchers' clothes, some were wearing guard uniforms, and some were soldiers wearing combat uniforms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were obviously bitten to death and infected by the living dead. They opened their mouths, revealing sharp teeth, and rushed towards Alexander with roars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander wielded the Lightsaber. And zombies' heads were chopped off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If they were released, they would eat all living animals and humans, and infect them, causing their kind to grow exponentially.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander thought it should have been a while since Elaine activated the base's self-destruction program.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't want to delay and waved his hand to create Force Burning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, balls of pale flames burned in the corridor, and the scorching flames quickly spread deep into the base.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, a loud roar came from the direction of the research center.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A giant ran toward Alexander, carrying the unconscious Elaine in his hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The giant's body was highly decayed, his huge eyes flashed red, and his thick limbs were like tree trunks, full of powerful strength.</span></p><div class="pagination">
