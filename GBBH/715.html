  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, in some regions of </span><span>Loscity</span><span>, mainly the slums, a terrifying disease had begun to spread.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This infectious disease was ruthless. Even masks and gloves weren't enough protection. Once infected, victims suffered from violent coughing fits, followed by pulmonary fibrosis, before dying from multiple organ failure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What most people didn't know was that Monica, the ruler of the City of Sorcery, unleashed this plague. It was a mysterious poison of her making.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This deadly poison had been excavated from an ancient tomb by Monica and Rock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In their expedition, Monica claimed the poison while Rock took possession of the Ancient Grimoire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The poison's potency had weakened considerably over the millennia. Otherwise, the exposure would have instantly melted victims into pools of black liquid.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though the poison's toxicity had weakened, it was still terrifyingly potent. It was incredibly contagious, the symptoms hit you like a freight train, and once they did, you were in serious trouble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Within a week, the infected suffer total organ failure. Their bodies start hemorrhaging; their skin erupts in ulcers... it was a gruesome death, and there was nothing anyone could do to stop it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Standing in her office at the Saint Group headquarters, Ava watched ambulances racing through the streets below.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What in the world is happening? God help </span><span>Loscity</span><span>," Ava whispered, her beautiful face etched with concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her phone rang twice, and Ava's face lit up when she saw Alexander's reply.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Alexander by her side, Ava felt utterly safe. She knew that even if the sky came crashing down, she'd have nothing to worry about.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The wailing of sirens pierced the air as ambulances rushed patients into hospitals across the city.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Crowds of people were flooding into hospitals, too, supporting sick friends and family members who needed urgent care.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Loscity</span><span> Hospital, being the largest in the city, had the most wards and beds available.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melin stood at the entrance, her stunning figure accentuated by her fitted police uniform.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But right now, her stunning face was set in an icy mask. The Chief had assigned her to this beat, responsible for keeping the peace at </span><span>Loscity</span><span> Hospital, and it was proving to be one hell of a job.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though it was her first time dealing with such a bizarre situation, Melin showed no sign of backing down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Melin! We've got trouble! All the wards are full, and people are getting aggressive because we can't admit any more patients!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A young nurse with chubby cheeks rushed over, her round face filled with anxiety.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stay calm. I'll handle this!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melin gestured to her officers and strode quickly toward the emergency room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The scene in the spacious lobby was chaotic. Dozens of stretchers were scattered haphazardly across the floor, each holding a patient.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The air was filled with agonized moans as patients writhed in obvious pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The scene was horrific. Patients lost control of their bodily functions and vomited non-stop. The stench was enough to make anyone's stomach turn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was like a scene straight out of hell. Melin's frown deepened as she felt her hands and feet begin to shake.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Please, I'm begging you! Save my wife!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Help my daughter, please, hurry!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you don't save my son, I'll kill you all!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A mob of desperate family members surrounded the doctors and nurses. Some were pleading, others making threats. The whole place was in complete chaos.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Please understand! We're at full capacity! You need to go to other hospitals! Please, try somewhere else!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stand back! We need to treat our patients!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The medical staff was drenched in sweat, completely overwhelmed. None of them had ever seen anything this terrifying. It felt like the end of the world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Loscity</span><span> Hospital was packed to the brim, severely understaffed, and couldn't possibly take any more patients.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet ambulances and families kept bringing in more sick people. The crowd was so thick you couldn't see through it, completely blocking the hospital entrance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh God! My throat suddenly hurts so bad... My heart's racing... Why am I coughing?... Am I infected?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>New infections were popping up everywhere, with people coughing so hard they could barely breathe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Everyone </span><span>clear</span><span> the area! Now! Sound the alarm! It is a severe infectious disease outbreak! Everyone needs to evacuate immediately!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melin shouted through the megaphone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The emergency sirens blared throughout the hospital, their piercing wail continuing without pause.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone froze in shock! It was the hospital's epidemic alarm!</span></p><div class="pagination">
