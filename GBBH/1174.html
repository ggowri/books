  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander could no longer restrain himself and, without hesitation, ventured into Lynn's realm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lynn lay helplessly, her expression seeming both extremely painful and incredibly satisfied and excited.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The off-road vehicle shook violently, with groans and gasps heard one after another.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After more than an hour, the intense battle finally subsided.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lynn lay satisfied in Alexander's arms, gently stroking his strong chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander saw the glistening tears in Lynn's eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why are you crying? Was I too rough just now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was a little puzzled and asked hesitantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lynn shook her head with tears in her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, thank you. If it weren't for you, I might never see my daughter again."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lynn hugged Alexander tightly again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smiled and patted her round buttocks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lynn coquettishly twisted her body and rubbed against Alexander. Then she felt Alexander's erect cock again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can't take it anymore. I really can't."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lynn quickly pleaded, her eyes flashing with enchanting charm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander hugged Lynn again, lowered his head, kissed her red lips, and dominantly stuck his tongue in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gradually, the breath of the two became heavy again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Lynn gritted her teeth and was about to endure Alexander's fierce impact again, he pushed her away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander took a long breath and suppressed the impulsive desire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You are like my elder, and you need to rest well. I can't tire you out."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Lynn heard the term "elder", she blushed even more and became even more embarrassed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two put on their clothes, and Alexander drove home attentively.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lynn occasionally admired Alexander's handsome profile. She had a very complex mood, with excitement, deep gratitude, and even a bit of anxiety.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lynn felt a little disappointed because she couldn't have such an outstanding man all to herself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But as soon as she thought of Ava becoming Alexander's wife, Lynn felt relieved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She knew that she had deeply fallen in love with Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At first, Lynn was guided by Ava and Alexander to take that step and was conquered by Alexander's excellent bed skills.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, Lynn had fallen in love with Alexander with all her heart, so she couldn't help but be anxious, unable to control herself, and constantly thinking about it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's wrong? Is everything okay?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander could tell that Lynn was burdened with worries.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's nothing. I just feel that being by your side with Ava is the greatest luck."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lynn felt a bit embarrassed but mostly joyful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander laughed and affectionately touched her cheek.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under the calm moonlight, the SUV quickly left the Forest Park and disappeared into the deep night.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was when Alexander brought Lynn back to the villa that Rosalia, who had been waiting all along, finally breathed a sigh of relief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>During this period, she felt like it had been a century, so long. She didn't dare to relax at all and didn't dare to contact Alexander, afraid it would affect his actions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Alexander and Lynn return safely, Rosalia finally felt relieved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, I'm going to sleep first. I'm so tired."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lynn yawned, her beautiful face showing exhaustion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>First, Lynn had to expend a lot of energy dealing with the black-clothed men, and then she worked hard to serve Alexander. She was indeed exhausted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Lynn wiggled her butt and walked into her room, Alexander turned around and playfully hooked his finger at Rosalia. "Come, let's go to my study."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, Mr. Hawthorne." Rosalia was overjoyed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosalia had been holding it in for a long time. She originally thought that Alexander wouldn't satisfy her tonight, but she didn't expect that the first thing Alexander did when he came back was summon her to the study.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosalia obediently followed behind Alexander and even reached out to touch his butt, being shameless to the extreme.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as the study door closed, before Alexander even made a move, Rosalia couldn't wait any longer and knelt down, unzipping Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander snorted, "Good girl."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He fondled Rosalia's buttocks and found them unexpectedly damp. He chuckled, "Such a slut."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosalia's enthusiasm had been aroused, and she was ready to accept Alexander's conquest. But Lynn was suddenly abducted, leaving Rosalia with suppressed desires burning within her.</span></p><div class="pagination">
