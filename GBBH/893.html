She subconsciously raised her head and looked into Alexander's eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, Vivian's eyes became dull and confused. Influenced by Alexander's Force Control, an anchor of submission was planted in her spiritual world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vivian suddenly felt that Alexander was not so scary anymore and even had a little admiration for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She panicked and stammered, "What... What did you do to me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander ignored her and waved to Marvin. "Take her back!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vivian was Brandon's daughter, so she would be a useful pawn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She excelled in poison and assassination, a cruel beauty, yet Alexander remained unfazed.</span></p><div class="pagination">
