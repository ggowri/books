  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man appeared with a head full of silver hair, his face deeply wrinkled like ancient tree bark, and his figure slightly stooped yet still exuding a commanding presence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Levi and the others found themselves in desperate straits, the Godfather finally arrived, immediately pleading for their lives.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, these men were pillars of the organization and losing them to Alexander's wrath would be a severe blow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My son, your power now... Even I, known as the Reaper, would think twice before underestimating you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In Heinrich Hawthorne's old, wise eyes was a glint of a mixture of astonishment and admiration as he gazed at Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moments earlier, Alexander's display of power had seemed almost divine, a boundless strength that had utterly surpassed Heinrich's own, filling him with both amazement and joy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the end, Alexander chose not to press further, sparing Levi and his group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a great battle on the horizon, they could still prove useful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Killing his own people just before such a fight would indeed bode ill. But while he'd spared their lives, punishment was still due.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Heinrich rose slowly from his wheelchair, leaning on his cane as he made his way over to Levi and the others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Levi fell to his knees, profusely apologizing, sobbing, and repenting all at once.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Godfather, I didn't know he was your son! I was wrong. I accept any punishment!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He cried, slapping his own face repeatedly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lucas and the others also knelt, following Levi's lead, slapping their own faces and pleading for mercy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The air was filled with the sounds of their wails, and the onlookers broke into a cold </span><span>sweat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a good thing they hadn't attacked earlier, for none had guessed that this figure was Godfather's own son.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All eyes turned to Alexander, now filled with awe and reverence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My son, you decide how to handle them."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Heinrich gestured to Alexander and left the decision in his hands. He wanted to see what judgment Alexander would ultimately render.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander strode forward to Levi and his men, towering over them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I should have killed all of you. But my father has pleaded on your behalf, and with the battle against Felix imminent, I'll spare your lives for now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"When the fighting begins, you will be the vanguard. Earn your redemption on the battlefield!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These men could indeed prove useful in the coming battle. If any tried to flee, Alexander could snuff them out in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both Heinrich and Shadow nodded in approval. Alexander's decision was prudent, asserting his authority and dignity while also showing mercy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne is truly merciful!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>So</span><span> this is the famous Mr. Hawthorne! They say seeing is believing, and indeed it's true."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Incredible! I'm convinced!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Levi and his crew lacked vision. Mr. Hawthorne has been exceptionally forgiving, but if they don't prove their worth in battle, even I won't show them mercy!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Murmurs of approval spread through the crowd as everyone watched Alexander with admiration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These were fighters who respected strength, and it was clear that Alexander's power surpassed even that of the Godfather and Shadow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you, Mr. Hawthorne, for sparing us!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Rest assured, Mr. Hawthorne, we'll fight bravely and redeem ourselves in battle."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Levi, Lucas, and the others now stood humbly, their former arrogance completely erased.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My son, all these years, I couldn't find you. It was my failing, and I'm sorry," Heinrich said sincerely, apologizing to Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone was stunned. The Godfather, known for his ruthless decisiveness, was bowing his head in front of everyone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander felt a mix of emotions; he had once believed his father was dead and had never held any resentment toward him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After hearing Heinrich's apology, any lingering discomfort in his heart dissolved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the tension from this encounter faded, the banquet atmosphere revived, buzzing with energy once more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were all battle-hardened individuals, unperturbed by the sight of blood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shadow raised his glass to Alexander in a toast, his admiration genuine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne, your strength has advanced so quickly! Since the last time we met, you've more than doubled in power! I'm truly envious!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander gave a slight smile as they clinked glasses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unable to resist, Heinrich asked, "Son, what level of metahuman do you consider yourself now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His voice held a faint tremor, his anticipation clear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>According to data from the development of the power elixir, metahumans theoretically had nine levels. However, the highest known level so far was only three.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander's power was sufficient to contend with a level-six metahuman, and with a lightsaber, he could even defeat a level-seven metahuman.</span></p><div class="pagination">
