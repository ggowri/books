  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hooray! We did it!!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A voice rang out, lifting spirits as someone raised their arms high in the air in jubilant celebration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hooray!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hooray!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the makeshift walls, countless people were overwhelmed with emotion, some even wiping tears from their eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just moments ago, they had thought death was imminent, resigned to the fact that survival was a fleeting luxury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But they never expected that Alexander would bring them a glimmer of hope.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All the heavy artillery and ammunition were delivered by Alexander's convoy, and now, a newfound confidence swelled within them. They believed they might just hold on until military reinforcements arrived; the dawn of victory seemed to be within reach.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In stark contrast to the victorious commotion, a shadow flitted through the ranks of the beast horde.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This figure wasn't imposing; in fact, compared to the surrounding mutated monkeys, it appeared rather diminutive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only Alexander seemed to notice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a human cloaked in black.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If not for Alexander's acute awareness and extraordinary perception, honed by constant vigilance toward the mutated monkeys and their king, he wouldn't have spotted the figure at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His sharp gaze pierced the smoke and chaos, locking onto the figure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The figure gestured toward the Mutated Monkey King a few times, and almost immediately, the king emitted a furious roar that reverberated across the battlefield.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quickly, the mutated beasts split into several groups, cleverly maneuvering around the burning area as they pressed toward the port.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They coiled like vicious serpents, weaving past the flames and launching their aggressive approach toward the harbor once more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, the air was filled with the staccato of gunfire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Flashes of brilliant fire erupted from the guns, mixing with the booming artillery to wreak havoc on the horde of beasts, sending mutated creatures flying in all directions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blood mingled with rainwater on the ground, spilling like crimson rivulets as chunks of flesh soared into the sky, only to rain down like grotesque confetti.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Mutated Monkey King loomed large among them, its intelligence and size giving it a formidable presence. It bellowed in fury while barreling toward the port.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With eyes as wide as saucers, their redness a stark contrast against its now slightly crimson fur, the king towered nearly ten feet tall, clutching a streetlight pole as a weapon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With relentless howls, the Mutated Monkey King charged ahead, leading the assault against </span><span>Louvian</span><span> Port in a furious counterattack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Alexander's artillery was substantial, it wasn't infinite.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the frequency of the shelling began to wane, the mutated horde seemed to recognize their opportunity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They followed the Mutated Monkey King into the fray, fearless and undeterred, surging toward the port.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under Alexander's command, several heavy machine guns alongside sniper rifles trained their fire on the monstrous monkey king.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No matter if there was someone pulling strings behind the scenes, eliminating the Mutated Monkey King would undoubtedly alleviate a significant portion of the threat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A torrent of bullets erupted, showering the Mutated Monkey King in a relentless blitz.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander remained focused, his eyes reflecting determination. Even from a thousand yards away, he could see clearly amidst the chaos.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although the machine guns packed a punch, their effectiveness was diminished at longer ranges.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite some bullets finding their mark, they failed to bring the king down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead, they merely punctured its hide, creating bloody holes without delivering a fatal blow. However, the unfortunate beasts surrounding the king paid the price, falling lifeless to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chunks of blood erupted from the Mutated Monkey King as it howled in agony; the pain was intense, though not life-threatening. Yet the sheer ferocity of the firepower had him crying out in distress.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Alexander braced himself for a heavier assault, he noticed the Mutated Monkey King had become more cunning. The creature crouched low, scrambling forward on all fours and using the bodies of other mutated beasts as makeshift shields against the torrent of fire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Its coat, a terrifying shade of crimson, resembled a bloodied specter creeping ever closer to the makeshift wall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Determined to take down the beast, Alexander personally grabbed a sniper rifle and loaded it with an armor-piercing round.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Here goes nothing!" he muttered, setting his sights on the monkey king.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The rifle rang out, the muzzle flash lighting up the smoky air as the armor-piercing bullet surged forward, fueled by the Force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the creature was quick on its feet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Alexander fired, it hoisted the corpse of a nearby mutated beast as a barricade.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew the power of these rounds&mdash;designed to pierce through light armor, and with the added boost of the Force, the bullet spun fiercely. It cut through the carcass effortlessly and slammed into the Mutated Monkey King's massive skull.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From his vantage point, Alexander watched with cold clarity. He could see the bullet, about the width of a finger, spiraling violently as it struck the king's hardened cranium, sending a shower of sparks flying. "That head of yours must be tougher than a tank," Alexander thought, aware of just how thick that skull was.</span></p><div class="pagination">
