Each of you will receive one million before departure. Let's have a good time. After we return, you will be rewarded with five million!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now is a critical moment for his survival, so Felix must of course win over the hearts of the people.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you, Mr. Vanderbilt! I am willing to work for you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>More than a dozen mutants knelt down in front of Felix.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix put his hands behind his back, showing a very satisfied expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Very good. You are all my most loyal subordinates. When I get through this difficult time, the Red Umbrella Group will definitely move to a higher level, and you will naturally benefit from it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After he obtained Francis' promise to send troops, he was full of confidence and believed that the Morris family would also join forces with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Francis' support and an ancient family that has lasted for thousands of years, it is enough to crush Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for his father, Felix has seen through him. Since he did not send Shadow to assassinate him, he will no longer pursue his father's mistake of disobeying orders and attacking Ashley.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmph!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix sneered. One of the important reasons why he was able to secure the position of Godfather was that he would use any means necessary.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If I do whatever it takes, it will align with his expectations.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Morris family is my trump card for a comeback!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Few people know that the Morris family started as a family through assassination. They were proficient in martial arts and were good at using hidden weapons and poisons. They were a terrifying family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, after the cooperation between the Morris family and the Red Umbrella Group, several of their children have successfully evolved superpowers under the guidance of potential potions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barry was one of the best among them. He was already a level-three metahuman and had great skills. His actual combat power could even compete with a level-four metahuman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, the Morris family's influence spreads throughout the north, and it is known as the number one family in the north. The only word to describe it is terrifying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Go back and get ready. We'll set off in three hours!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix gave an order.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, Mr. Vanderbilt!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The special forces team retreated respectfully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix came to the basement and looked at Danielle who was huddled in the corner, with a terrifying evil look in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No! No, please, don't..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Danielle was already scared by the torture, her nose and tears were streaming down her face, and she shook her head desperately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She couldn't bear the torture of this demon and felt that life was worse than death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix showed no mercy to Danielle. He grabbed her hair, dragged her into the next room and slammed the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Danielle's eyes were filled with fear. She had been to this place more than once or twice. It was simply hell on earth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What came into view was a chair with handcuffs attached.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were all kinds of strange torture instruments hanging on the surrounding walls, including thick hemp ropes and whips, as well as various sex toys, which made Danielle feel uneasy, and her heart beat rapidly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How is it? Bitch, have you fallen in love with this place? You are so excited."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix, who was in a good mood, teased Danielle deliberately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No! Please... please let me go. I won't tell anyone... I promise I have my child waiting for me at home..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Danielle's will had already collapsed, and she covered her face and cried bitterly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Danielle was first brought here by Felix, she still held on to hope and had an indomitable spirit in her heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had been tortured for quite some time, and her initial strength had long been broken into pieces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No matter whether Felix was happy or unhappy, he continued to torture her with these things.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All kinds of weird ways!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For Danielle, this was a very terrifying nightmare.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Danielle hadn't been worried about her breastfeeding child at home, she would have found an opportunity to commit suicide long ago.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, Felix threatened her with her husband and child, so that she dared not resist at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Otherwise, Danielle, who had a hot temper, might really take the opportunity to bite his crotch.</span></p><div class="pagination">
