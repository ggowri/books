  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a simple kick, swift and powerful, it struck the muscular man's shin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Crack!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sharp sound of breaking bone echoed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His leg snapped, the jagged white bone protruding out, and he fell hard to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was in so much pain that he couldn't even scream. Just as he managed to catch his breath and prepare to shout, Alexander kicked his throat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The horrifying sound of another fracture resounded, and the man lay motionless, head </span><span>drooping.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The remaining group was utterly stunned. They had seen their companion charge forward like a tiger, gaining the upper hand, only to be knocked down by Alexander in an instant and then dealt a fatal blow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A flicker of fear shone in the woman's eyes. Although she didn't like that man, she knew his power was on par with her own.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were all battle-tested Shadow Warriors, ranked among the top ten in the entire Red Umbrella Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, in a mere encounter, one had been killed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's expression remained calm as if he had merely done something trivial.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked coldly at the woman. "You're a Shadow Warrior of the Red Umbrella Group?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You figure that out?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The woman realized she couldn't hide it any longer, her palms and soles drenched in cold sweat, feeling her grip on the katana slipping.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You and he are Shadow Warriors, and there are two gray wizards with you. Is the Red Umbrella Group linked to the City of Sorcery?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander scrutinized them, his gaze sharp.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>An overwhelming pressure suddenly filled the space as if the air itself had thickened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The woman couldn't help but swallow hard. His gaze was terrifying as if he could see through all her hidden secrets.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had only felt such a chilling sensation with Felix Vanderbilt, the chairman of the Red Umbrella Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Since you're here, let's not waste time. Attack," Alexander said casually.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At his words, the woman felt a jolt in her heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Go!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No longer hesitating, she shouted, slashing her katana toward Alexander's left shoulder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The blade glimmered like snow, slicing through the air with a speed even faster than the muscular man's earlier strike.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Alexander had already vanished from the couch as if he had never been there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he reappeared, the couch lay in two pieces, cushions shredded, feathers flying everywhere.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Impressive swordsmanship!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Alexander was faster. The woman struck five times in rapid succession, creating a web of blades, yet not one touched Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The nearby furniture suffered greatly, being sliced to pieces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With each swift cut, beads of sweat began to form on her forehead, and her strength began to falter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander stood with his hands behind his back, admiring the woman's stunning figure, a smirk appearing on his lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was quite skilled, perhaps even better than Augusta.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, her figure was fantastic&mdash;a real siren. Alexander felt an urge to recruit her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Having someone like her on his side would significantly boost their strength and be a </span><span>pleasure to look at.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If I'm not mistaken, you're not just any Shadow Warrior. You should rank high in the Red Umbrella Group."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The woman, panting to catch her breath, replied coldly, "The strength of the Red Umbrella Group is beyond your imagination. I'm just temporarily ahead; once the second-generation power elixir is in use, it will create warriors several times more powerful than me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander frowned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Second-generation power elixir? Has the Red Umbrella Group resolved the side effects?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The woman smirked. She spoke more to buy time to regain her strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Alexander wasn't fooled. He had already seen through her plan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I suggest </span><span>you</span><span> surrender, or I'll have to get serious."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander warned, his deep gaze flashing with an unsettling brilliance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unbeknownst to her, he had begun to exert the Force's control over her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What are you doing?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The woman sensed something was off, her mind suddenly becoming hazy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And Alexander's eyes grew brighter, seemingly penetrating her mind, refusing to let go.</span></p><div class="pagination">
