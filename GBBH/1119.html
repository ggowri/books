The carpet was soaked in blood, and the metallic stench of it filled the air, stinging Alexander's nostrils.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This had been one of the worst assassination attempts Alexander had ever faced.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The dagger Loren wielded was coated in cyanide&mdash;one of the deadliest poisons known to man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Cyanide was often called the "King of Poisons," and any spy worth their salt carried it, a deadly, almost instantaneous poison that could kill within seconds and was nearly impossible to counter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Had it not been for Alexander's extraordinary resilience and his "Force", he would have been dead by now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Alexander could feel his body beginning to shut down as if it was going to crack open from the inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Thud!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With sheer determination, he shoved the deformed car door open and stumbled out, dizzy and barely conscious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The moment his feet hit the ground, he collapsed onto his knees, his vision blurring. His trembling hand fumbled for his bloody phone, and with difficulty, he dialed emergency services.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His back and chest were punctured by three deep wounds, the wounds already turning black as blood gushed out uncontrollably.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It wasn't just the poison&mdash;it was the triple-edged dagger that made the bleeding impossible to stop.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Blood pooled on the ground, a dark, horrific bloom that seemed to spread with every passing second.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even with his body's resistance to toxins, the excessive blood loss would eventually claim his life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The severity of his injuries sent him into a delirious haze, his mind briefly drifting back to several years ago, to the Fairfax family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He remembered the blow to his head from a wine bottle, the pain, the blood&mdash;everything felt like the same.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Since the plague in Loscity, he hadn't seen Jane or Belinda. They had surely left the city. He didn't want to see Jane again&mdash;not ever.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"So... am I really going to die here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A bitter smile tugged at the corner of his lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>What about Ashley?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>What about Ava?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>What about the Ultimate Alliance?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Suddenly, the blaring sirens of an approaching ambulance pierced through the fog of his thoughts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A surge of survival instinct rushed through him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If only I'd brought Augusta, or even one of my subordinates... I wouldn't have ended up like this."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He cursed under his breath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I was careless."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As the ambulance pulled up beside him, a team of doctors in white coats rushed out, lifting a stretcher. Alexander let out a shaky breath of relief and finally closed his eyes, slipping into unconsciousness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In Loscity Hospital Emergency Room. "How is he?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ava, her eyes red from crying, rushed forward the moment the doctor stepped out, grabbing his arm desperately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Oh my!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The doctor stumbled back, startled by her sudden movement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Oliver quickly stepped in to smooth things over. "Ms. Blackburn, please, be careful. Dr. Cook is already in his sixties."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ava froze, taking a step back as she let go of Dr. Brody Cook, her hands trembling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Ava wasn't the only one anxious&mdash;Betty, Rebecca, Melin, and the others were all on edge, their eyes glued to Dr. Cook as they waited for an answer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Brody wiped his brow, feeling a chill run down his spine as all their eyes fixed on him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone knew the situation&mdash;two assassins had been killed by Alexander, but he had been gravely wounded and poisoned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The poison? Cyanide&mdash;the most lethal poison known to man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When Ava first heard the news, she nearly passed out from shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"It's my fault! It's my fault... I shouldn't have asked Mr. Hawthorne for help..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Oliver muttered to himself, slapping his own face in frustration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The thought of Alexander dying filled him with dread. If he did die, Ava, Brittany, and Grace would never forgive him. He could already imagine their fury, their wrath&mdash;he would never survive it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ava's voice was shaky as she asked, "Dr. Cook, how is Alexander?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Brody's brow furrowed in confusion as he examined the charts, his tone cautious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This doesn't make sense. By all logic, someone poisoned with cyanide should be dead by now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"But Mr. Hawthorne is still alive&mdash;though he's severely shocked from blood loss. We've given him a blood transfusion, and we're doing everything we can."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A moment of hope flickered in the room, and Melin's voice trembled with cautious optimism. "So, does that mean he's going to be okay?"</span></p><div class="pagination">
