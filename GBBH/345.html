He gradually died with his eyes wide open.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander threw his body far away like trash.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madelyn, are you okay?" he asked with concern, unable to resist looking at her buttocks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were smooth and tender, like ripe, juicy peaches that would spill their sweet juices with a single bite.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander swallowed subconsciously and reached out to help Madelyn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, she pivoted around, and his hands immediately fell on her buttocks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Madelyn uttered a coquettish groan and collapsed to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wanted to get up, but she really couldn't.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, thank you! Please help me up. I am sorry. I have a disorder. Once scared, I will have a strong stress reaction, the whole body weak, unable to stand up..." Madelyn explained hesitantly, her face flushed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander licked his lips, already burning with desire.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's okay. I'll help you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander bent down and reached out to support Madelyn again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They got closer and could feel each other's warm breath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Madelyn suddenly grabbed Alexander's hand, pressed it to her chest, and asked shyly, </span><span>"Alexander, am I pretty?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said nothing and wanted to take his hand back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Madelyn held his hand tightly and laid it on her full breasts.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He felt the smooth touch and couldn't help but rub her breasts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Madelyn let out a scream.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander took a deep breath to suppress his desire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll help you. Get up quickly."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He put his arms around Madelyn's waist and picked her up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander, not being a fool, realized that she liked him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She lay weakly in his arms and held him tight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her skirt had been torn by Caleb long ago. Her plump and sexy body was extremely smooth and pressed closely against Alexander's.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, do you dislike me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Madelyn felt so aggrieved that she was about to cry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caleb molested her, but now, Alexander was even more ruthless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She mustered up the courage to seduce him, but he rejected her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it had been another man, he would have pounced on her long ago.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't cry. You are pretty and charming..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander comforted Madelyn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She cupped his face and kissed him, sucking out his tongue while placing his hands on her breasts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, she sensed that he had an erection like a normal man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She smiled sweetly, "You are attracted to me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madelyn, will you regret it? I can't promise you anything..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Alexander could finish his words, Madelyn interrupted him, "I don't want you to promise anything. I just want to thank you and make love to you. You are a heartthrob."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She couldn't help but slip her hand into his pants.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madelyn, you are very naughty!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander couldn't bear it anymore and started to take the initiative.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Madelyn wondered if she was crazy. She actually seduced him. However, she was soon overwhelmed by the surging pleasure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madelyn, I can't help myself. It's all your fault. You have to calm me down today," Alexander chuckled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Madelyn blushed. After instructing him to sit down, she straddled him and moved constantly. Her breasts and buttocks swayed as she tried to please him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They lost control, enjoying sex and forgetting everything...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>An hour later, Madelyn hugged Alexander tightly, and her full buttocks trembled violently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, she closed her eyes, almost fainting with the orgasm.</span></p><div class="pagination">
