  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava instinctively took a few steps back, pressed against the wall, her face hot as she realized she was already wet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander kissed her directly, savoring her smooth, soft skin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eventually, Ava began to tremble, moaning, "Alexander, haven't you had enough? You're such a monster..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He scooped her up and tossed her next to Rebecca.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No...," she protested, feeling overwhelmed with embarrassment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Alexander wouldn't let her go. He ripped off her bath towel and began to touch her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Rebecca saw Ava, her face flushed as well. "Alexander, you're great! Ava, let's both be his women from now on."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava's mouth was filled with Alexander's member, leaving her unable to respond.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rebecca's desire reignited as she watched, and she couldn't help but reach for Ava's curves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Rebecca, don't..." Ava stammered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, Alexander positioned his member at Ava's entrance and began thrusting wildly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah! I love you..." Ava moaned, pulling Alexander closer, trying to make her body cooperate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a smile, Rebecca leaned in and kissed Ava passionately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander took advantage of the situation, alternating between the two women as he pleased.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rebecca and Ava kissed wildly, groaning and moaning echoing in the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava, receiving special attention from Alexander, was on the verge of losing herself. Afraid of saying something embarrassing in front of Rebecca, she silenced herself with fervent kisses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was the first time Alexander had seen Ava so enthusiastic, and he was motivated by her energy, increasing his pace and intensity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava responded eagerly, reaching multiple climaxes before finally passing out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shifting his focus to Rebecca, he let her sit on his lap and thrust forcefully for over 20 minutes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, it was Ava's turn again. With her thighs folded against her chest, Alexander resumed his thrusting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava gripped the bed sheets tightly, moaning loudly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After more than two hours of passion, everything finally settled down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava and Rebecca lay in Alexander's arms, one on each side.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rebecca was so exhausted she quickly fell into a deep sleep.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava, however, lingered on, stroking Alexander's chest and asking, "Besides me and Rebecca, how many other women do you have?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smiled. "I haven't kept count, but no matter how many there are, you're my favorite."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Liar!" Ava rolled her eyes playfully, but her heart swelled with happiness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander pinched her soft curves with a chuckle before saying, "I miss your mom. Why don't you invite her over? We could all have some fun together."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava pouted. "You're so naughty! You just finished and already have those ideas. I won't do anything with my mom."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander playfully swatted her buttocks and said, "Even though the Morris family </span><span>was taken down and the Red Umbrella Group has been significantly weakened, Felix isn't dead yet. He'll definitely come back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And with the Mafia and the City of Sorcery watching us closely, I rarely get a break. Why not spend some time with me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava's heart softened. "Okay, I know you're going through a tough time. Mom misses you, too. I'll send someone to pick her up. Satisfied now, you big pervert?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Honey, you're the best!" Alexander smiled and wrapped his arms around Ava's waist, planting a kiss on her lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava reciprocated passionately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After the kiss, Alexander leaned in and whispered in Ava's ear, "Ava, I want to share a secret with you so you don't misunderstand my intentions. I've inherited a legacy from James. If I want to strengthen my abilities quickly, being intimate with a woman is the best way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So please forgive me. You've always been the woman I love the most!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava was stunned momentarily and asked excitedly, "Really? What kind of legacy is it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander thought for a moment before answering, "It's called the Ultimate Legacy. I may be the last Warrior in the world!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
