  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Killer King's sword was nearly at Alexander's belly when the sharp Lightsabers emerged.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Lightsabers quickly cut through his katana and slashed straight through his right arm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Squeak!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was like the tip of a red-hot knife was inserted into the cake, easily cutting off the Killer King's right arm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ah!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Killer King let out a shrill scream, and blood splattered all over the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Just then, there were two consecutive gunshots. It was Marvin who fired two more shots.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Though gravely injured, the Killer King evaded two shots with strong instincts, rolling and dodging grotesquely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, the blood from his broken right arm was flowing even more violently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was not until then that Norma's bodyguards came to their senses and rushed towards the Killer King, who was lying on the ground, trying to capture him alive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Get away from me, rubbish!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Killer King roared angrily and rushed towards a bodyguard like a wounded tiger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although he was running away, he attacked without mercy, holding a dagger in his uninjured left hand and attacking frantically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Every time he stabbed, a bodyguard would cover his throat or chest and fall to the ground, twitching.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Killer King's dagger was coated with lethal poison, causing the stabbed bodyguards to turn black and become immobilized.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Moreover, despite his broken arm and serious injuries, the Killer King took advantage of the time when these poisoned bodyguards blocked Alexander and Marvin's way and rushed out of the corridor like a fleeing poisonous snake.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Killer King was about to disappear into the night and escape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, Alexander did not chase after him, but took the gun from Marvin and aimed at the Killer King.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This was a black Desert Eagle with a dark muzzle that exuded a sharp, murderous aura.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With a gun in hand, Alexander seemed like a different person.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His vision locked onto the Killer King, who was very cunning and kept changing his escape route and speed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, there seemed to be a supercomputer in Alexander's mind, calculating the Killer King's escape speed, possible direction, and angle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He also evaluated changes in the surrounding environment and wind speed, which formed a prediction of the direction of the Killer King's escape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>None of the factors that affected the bullet hitting the target could escape Alexander's calculation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The fatal shot had firmly locked onto the Killer King!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Meanwhile, the Killer King's face changed drastically. He felt as if there was a sword on his back that could take his life at any time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before Alexander fired the shot, the momentum had already destroyed the Killer King's confidence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His feet couldn't help but tremble, and he slowed down significantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Bang!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander pulled the trigger, and a flash of fire appeared from the black muzzle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With the help of the Force, the bullet reached an unprecedented speed and shot towards the back of the Killer King at hypersonic speed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ah!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Killer King screamed miserably again. He had been shot in the back, and his body flew forward under considerable inertia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He avoided the attack on the back of his heart and prevented it from exploding, but a wound that penetrated his entire body still left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Killer King stumbled as he ran, wounded on top of his wounds. He had completely lost the ability to resist, and his escape speed slowed down immensely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Now, he could only be dealt with by Alexander. This was his fate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Want to run, huh?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With a roar, Marvin chased after him, grabbed the Killer King's left arm, and threw him fiercely over his shoulder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Killer King was smashed to the ground, spitting out blood constantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He was just one step away from escaping, but in the end, he failed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Killer King knew that he had no chance to escape. His right hand was broken, and his lungs were pierced. He would never be able to be a killer again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He deeply regretted it. If he had known that there was such a powerful master protecting Norma, he would not have come even if he was given one billion dollars, let alone 500 million dollars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Damn you, Sean! You tricked me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Killer King roared in anger and then gritted his teeth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Black blood spurted out of his mouth, and his body began to twitch violently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marvin quickly pinched his mouth open and found that he had bitten his dentures into pieces, which contained a deadly poison.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon, the Killer King's body stiffened, and his bloodshot eyes were wide open, filled with unwillingness and resentment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Sir, he's dead. What should we do?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marvin scratched his head and reported to Alexander.</span></p><div class="pagination">
