  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gary's voice dripped with menace as he warned, "Young man, I strongly advise you to dial it back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Think about the consequences of your words and actions!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You may have struck it lucky with the magic powder, but it's just a tool for making money. The Federer family can still thrive without it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And let's not forget, Ms. Blackburn is a pragmatic woman; she won't jeopardize her interests with the Saint Group over you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander chuckled derisively.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If this is an auction, why are we wasting time with all this chatter? The highest bidder wins!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he turned his back on Gary, dismissing him entirely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gary, seething, sank heavily into his chair, clearly outraged.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>David leaned in, his voice barely above a whisper. "Gary, are we really just going to let this go?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gary shot him a glare that could freeze fire. "You, as a senator, are making a fool of the Federer family. It's utterly ridiculous."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Houtte</span><span>, eager to chime in, leaned closer with a sly grin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry, I'll take care of this for you. By tomorrow, Alexander will be a non-issue!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But I hope the Federer family is ready to team up with us against the Saint Group when they retaliate."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gary's expression turned serious. "And how do you propose we share the magic powder formula?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without hesitation, </span><span>Houtte</span><span> replied, "The formula I acquire will stay firmly in the hands of the Cripples, but I can offer the Federer family a fifty percent discount on our supply."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gary took a deep breath, nodding gravely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, it's a deal."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Alexander couldn't hear their conversation, he noticed the furtive whispers </span><span>and knew they were plotting against him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Federer family had considerable power, but with his current standing, he had no reason to fear them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, a man beside Alexander leaned in; concern etched on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne, it might be wise to let the Federer family have this gem. Otherwise, you could be inviting serious trouble."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Exactly. The Federer family has a long memory for grudges. It's just a rock; why not go with the flow and hand it over?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A few others nodded in agreement, echoing the sentiment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smiled, "I appreciate your concern, but this gem is incredibly important to me. I won't back down."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing his stubbornness, the others fell silent, exchanging resigned glances.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once the auction concluded, Alexander swiped his card and claimed his prize: the meteorite and exquisite yellow gemstone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He and Ava climbed into a sleek Rolls-Royce, leaving behind a crowd of envious onlookers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the luxury car glided smoothly along the road, Alexander's expression hardened when they reached a secluded spot by the lake.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes narrowed. "Watch out! We're being ambushed!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The driver jumped, startled by the urgency in Alexander's voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He quickly glanced in the rearview mirror and saw several black cars speeding towards them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before he could react, gunfire erupted, shattering the tranquility of the moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bullets riddled the Rolls-Royce, blowing out tires and raining glass everywhere.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quick as a flash, Alexander pushed Ava down, shielding her from the chaos.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They emerged unscathed, but the driver, panicking, lost control and veered off the road, crashing the car into a tree.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moments later, a dozen cars surrounded them, and dozens of men in black suits poured out, their assault rifles aimed squarely at the Rolls-Royce.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Houtte</span><span> smirked, reveling in the sight. "Looks like Alexander won't be flying away this time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it weren't for the magic powder formula, I'd have already turned him into a hornet's nest."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Houtte</span><span>, what are you playing at? Are you really trying to spark a war between the Cripples and the Saint Group?" Ava shot back, unflinching.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Houtte's</span><span> eyes hungrily roamed over Ava's voluptuous figure as he licked his lips with anticipation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Blackburn, why don't you be a good girl and raise your hands in surrender? Otherwise, don't say I didn't warn you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He envisioned himself getting his hands on the magic powder formula and taking down Alexander, after which Ava would be at his mercy. He had no intention of letting her slip away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before </span><span>Houtte</span><span> could make his next move, Alexander quickly moved to shield Ava, positioning her behind the side of the car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Houtte</span><span> taunted, swaggering with a newfound arrogance, "Alexander, what are you hiding for?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aren't you supposed to be the tough guy? Let's not forget it was you who got Joseph killed. Why don't you come out and face me?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've got over fifty men and a bunch of submachine guns with me. You really think you can take us on? If you've got the guts, step up!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
