  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Alexander's plan was too tempting. She had never thought about it this way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because no one could kill the bosses of several big gangs alone and cause chaos among them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How could the bosses of the Mafia, the Weaver family, Southern Mining, or the Glory Association be killed so easily?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was extremely difficult for strangers to enter their headquarters.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Especially Paxton. The Mafia's branch in Mandale Town was heavily guarded, with a surveillance system monitoring everything 24 hours a day, plus elite guards were everywhere.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bluntly, even if a bird flew in, it would be discovered immediately, let alone a living person getting in and assassinating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alyssa smiled bitterly and shook her head, saying, "Mr. Hawthorne, although your plan is good, it is impossible to complete. It should be just a dream."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The eyes of others looking at Alexander also became disdainful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone could brag.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They felt that Alexander was either talking nonsense or was mentally abnormal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly Alexander burst into laughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What? You don't believe me? You don't need to interfere in this matter. I can do it by myself."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although everyone was shocked by Alexander's confidence, they still didn't believe it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alyssa looked very solemn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne, this plan needs to be discussed carefully. To assassinate the leaders of so many forces, you can't do it alone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Especially over at Paxton's place, the Mafia's guards are so strict that not even a bird can fly in without permission. If you, a living person, try to sneak in, you will be discovered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Moreover, Paxton is much more powerful than Ian. He once won third place in the Soutaxia boxing Championship. Otherwise, Mafia wouldn't have given him such an important spot in Mandale Town to manage."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alyssa persuaded Alexander. She was mentally prepared to evacuate Mandale Town in time and blow up all the gem mines, exchanges, and warehouses before leaving.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's plan was unrealistic. If Alyssa hadn't known that Alexander was capable, she would have been impatient long ago.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander sighed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It seems that if I don't show you my skills today, you probably won't cooperate with me. Have you all forgotten that no one noticed me when I came in just now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alyssa and others were stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The conference room was heavily guarded. How could </span><span>Alexander walk</span><span> in so ostentatiously without alerting anyone?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Could it be that all the guards were negligent? That was impossible!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They wondered if Alexander did have superpowers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smiled and said, "I will leave now, leaving time for you to arrange for manpower to be on guard. I will sneak into the meeting room again in half an hour.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If I can get in without alerting anyone, then you should unconditionally cooperate with my plan. Okay?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Faced with the conditions proposed by Alexander, everyone was silent, obviously shocked by Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a long while, Alyssa was the first to come back to her senses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She slammed the table hard and shouted excitedly, "Okay, let's do as you say. If you make it, we will listen to you, and I can even let you be the leader of the Axe!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smiled and waved his hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No! I don't want to be the boss of the Axe. Start counting now. I will be back in half an hour. Bye."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying that, Alexander turned around and left the meeting room leisurely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alyssa quickly ordered, "Stanley, please send Mr. Hawthorne off. If Mr. Hawthorne has any requests, please try to satisfy him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stanley quickly caught up with Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander, who was walking in front, smiled calmly. It was obvious that Alyssa had sent Stanley to monitor him to verify his ability.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stanley's skills were among the best in the Axe, and he was ruthless. He was Alyssa's most capable and loyal subordinate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alyssa left many important matters to Stanley to deal with.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Therefore, Stanley was a capable person in the Axe, second only to Alyssa but above everyone else.</span></p><div class="pagination">
