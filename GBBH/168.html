  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Alexander returned home, his emotions were a tangled mess.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So much had happened lately&mdash;first, he had agreed to help </span><span>Lara</span><span> become the head of </span><span>the Hansen family, and now Mary had nearly been kidnapped by Mark and his crew, clearly with some powerful backing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although he had dealt with Sebastian and his son, it seemed like his troubles were multiplying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was still waiting for news from Augusta about Treasure Island, which could take a few more days.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alice</span><span> had sent over some meteorites containing metal, but he was still short on the quantity needed to forge a Lightsaber. The precious yellow gemstones he needed hadn't arrived yet, either.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Alexander was lost in his thoughts, the doorbell rang, jolting him from his reverie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Checking the security monitor, he saw it was Andrew and Belinda.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Didn't I tell Logan to give them the check? What are these two old geezers doing here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander </span><span>didn</span><span>&rsquo;</span><span>t want</span><span> to open the door, but they had already shown up, and there was no escaping it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He swung the door open</span><span> and looked at</span><span> Andrew</span><span> coldly</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What do you want? You're not welcome here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Andrew was about to speak, Belinda cut him off, her smile plastered on her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, we came to clarify something."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander, feeling impatient, snapped, "Just spit it out. I don't have time to waste on you two."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Belinda's smile faltered, turning icy as she asked, "We were swindled out of 40 million by Jackson.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why did you only give us a check for 10 million?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At her words, Alexander couldn't help but burst into laughter, albeit bitterly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So</span><span>,</span><span> you're implying I pocketed 30 million, huh?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Andrew, indignant, retorted, "Isn't that the case? If you could track down the scammer, you should've gotten all 40 million back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Instead, you kept 30 million for yourself. That's just outrageous!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A fire ignited within Alexander, his anger boiling over at the audacity of these ungrateful fools.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get lost! I swear, the next time I see you, I'll make sure to teach you a lesson!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His furious shout made both of them jump back, their faces paling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Andrew, still defiant, yelled, "Alexander, you're in cahoots with the scammer! You're scared we'll report you, so you returned 10 million while pocketing 30 million!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Belinda chimed in with a mocking tone, "Exactly! You can't be this shameless!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You owe us 40 million, and you only gave us 10! Watch out, or we'll call the cops on you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Besides, you've made a fortune with that magic powder. Even if you can't </span><span>take back</span><span> that 30 million, you should cover it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander felt like a boulder was lodged in his chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as he was about to give them a </span><span>lecture</span><span>, a Rolls-Royce pulled up to the curb, and Ava stepped out, gliding toward him with poise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Andrew and Belinda's faces went pale.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had the audacity to confront Alexander because they had forgotten the pain of their previous encounters with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had grown used to throwing their weight around, relying on their status as Ashley's grandparents.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, with Ava as the president of the Saint Group, they were suddenly intimidated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava's icy gaze locked on them as she commanded, "You have one minute to get lost. Scram!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Andrew and Belinda's faces drained of color, and they opened their mouths to protest but quickly shut them, </span><span>leaving</span><span> in a hurry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once they were far enough away, Andrew turned back, shouting, "Alexander, just you wait!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Jane's already consulting a lawyer. We're getting the best </span><span>lawyer</span><span> to sue you for fraud! You and that Jackson are definitely in league together!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's teeth ground together, a low, angry growl rumbling in his throat. If it weren't for the fact that Ashley would grow up someday and want to know about her grandparents, he'd have already taken out the two shameless old fools.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava sensed his tension and looped her arm through his, offering a gentle, reassuring smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Forget about those two, darling. Why let them ruin your day?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Here, try on the new clothes and shoes I bought for you. You'll need them for tomorrow's auction."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander exhaled, slowly calming himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sight of the shopping bags Ava had prepared for him filled his heart with gratitude.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ava, you're the best," he murmured, pulling her into a deep kiss.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His hands naturally drifted down to cup her round, firm buttocks.</span></p><div class="pagination">
