  <div class="container"><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;From the moment you set foot in Loscity, your fate was sealed. And don&#x27;t forget. You&#x27;ve hurt my people.&quot; Alexander&#x27;s murderous intent sharpened like a blade ready to strike.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Tyler&#x27;s desperation skyrocketed. He shouted, &quot;You promised you wouldn&#x27;t kill me! You said...&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Alexander grinned. &quot;Did I? I don&#x27;t remember making any promises. But since you&#x27;ve been so cooperative, I&#x27;ll make sure you die without pain.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;No! Please... No...&quot; His pleading was abruptly cut off by the sound of a gunshot.</p><p style="text-align:left;">The body remained trapped inside the car, discarded like worthless trash.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Alexander casually conjured a pale, flickering flame that enveloped the car and the body. In seconds, it was consumed by a roaring fireball.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Muttering to himself, he said, &quot;The construction of Treasure Island and Devil Island needs to be sped up... Yinson, you&#x27;d better hope I don&#x27;t find you. If I do, I&#x27;ll make sure you wish you were never born.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">He climbed into his car and sped off, disappearing into the dark night.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Meanwhile, Betty, leading a convoy of over twenty vehicles and a hundred people, had just arrived at the food factory. But after receiving Alexander&#x27;s orders, she quickly turned the convoy around and headed back.</p><p style="text-align:left;">*****</p><p style="text-align:left;">At Ultimate Alliance headquarters, Betty was helping Alexander wash off the blood staining his body.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Her fingers trailed over his back and chest as she tenderly caressed him. Unable to resist, she tilted her head up, pressing her lips against his in a deep kiss.</p><p style="text-align:left;">The two of them embraced once more, soaking in the bath as they discussed matters concerning Sakra Society.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Betty asked, &quot;Has there been any news on Yinson from Norma?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Alexander shook his head, smiling as he answered, &quot;Let&#x27;s not talk about unpleasant things. How about if we focus on something more enjoyable?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">He grabbed the body wash and began spreading it over Betty&#x27;s flawless legs.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Betty let out a soft hum, her cheeks flushed with warmth.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Then Alexander gently guided her to lean back, raising her right leg high.</p><p style="text-align:left;">He grasped her thigh and began running his hands up and down her leg, tracing its curves.</p><p style="text-align:left;">He cleaned her thoroughly, even massaging between her toes.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Mm...&quot; Betty felt a wave of tingling warmth rush through her body, a sensation so intense it made her weak with desire.</p><p style="text-align:left;">A man&#x27;s tenderness has a way of driving a woman wild, and Betty wasn&#x27;t immune.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Suddenly, she pulled her leg back, pounced, and pushed Alexander into a sitting position. One hand pressed against his chest, the other reaching down toward his lower body...</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Master, may I?&quot; Betty&#x27;s voice was soft and seductive, impossible to resist.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Alexander gazed at her flushed face, her eyes filled with passion, and couldn&#x27;t help but kiss her deeply. &quot;Come on. Let me feel some joy, too.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Betty flashed a pure yet seductive smile. She lowered her head, taking him in with a slow, deliberate motion.</p><p style="text-align:left;">A woman&#x27;s body is a man&#x27;s ultimate pleasure, but it&#x27;s also her own source of endless joy and satisfaction.</p><p style="text-align:left;">In the mirror, Betty raised her hips high, her head moving rhythmically as her hips swayed with each motion.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Alexander let out a deep breath, his body responding eagerly as his hands instinctively gripped her soft, full breasts, kneading them as he changed their shape with every touch.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Your body... it&#x27;s so soft,&quot; Alexander praised, unable to hide his appreciation.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Betty, eager to please, intensified her movements, her skill unmatched.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Alexander lifted her, sitting her on his lap, her back facing him.</p><p style="text-align:left;">She opened her lips wide, a satisfied expression spreading across her face.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Alexander&#x27;s eyes were locked on her, watching as his member disappeared into her, the sensation overwhelming.</p><p style="text-align:left;">From behind, he wrapped his arms around her, his hands gripping her firm, rounded hips.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Betty eagerly began to move, the sound of their bodies meeting filling the room with passion, along with her intoxicating moans.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Meanwhile, at Louvian Port, inside a restaurant, a group of men from Risun were anxiously waiting.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Joaquin Wexler stood at the front of the group, looking toward the door, his heart racing with a mixture of worry and anticipation.</p><p style="text-align:left;">He was an undercover agent for Sakra Society and a mid-level manager at the port.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Tyler had promised to bring the others, but the night passed, and there was no sign of them. Worse, they couldn&#x27;t get in touch.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Joaquin knew it was over for Tyler.</p><p style="text-align:left;">But Joaquin wasn&#x27;t just waiting for Tyler. He was also waiting for Stephen Merrett, the leader of this massive infiltration operation and the strongest agent personally trained by Yinson.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Stephen wasn&#x27;t just a level-three metahuman. After surviving the enhancement drug process, he had become as powerful as a level-five metahuman.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Where is Mr. Merrett?&quot; Joaquin glanced at the clock, his worry growing as the minutes ticked by.</p><div class="pagination">
