  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Oliver cautiously continued.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne, no offence, but... I think Ms. Ward... might be possessed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ahem... I'm sorry. This is just my guess. I could be talking nonsense."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As a police chief, it wasn't appropriate for Oliver to say such things.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But the idea of gods, angels, demons, and witchcraft was something many still believed in. Just because they didn't see something didn't mean it didn't exist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Possessed? Alright, thank you, Mr. Benton. I see."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander furrowed his brow. According to Oliver, this situation was becoming more complicated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>First, Gavin was poisoned, and now Melin might be possessed. He wondered if there was there a connection between the two.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Benton, do you know if Melin has seen a doctor?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"She has, but the doctor said there was nothing physically wrong with her. She's just mentally exhausted..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Oliver paused and fell silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Okay, I'm on my way to see Melin."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander agreed and then turned and rushed toward the police station.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Melin lived in a building behind the police station. Alexander had been there once before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At that moment, Melin was lying in bed, looking utterly drained.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Lately, her mind had been in turmoil, occasionally haunted by memories of the terrifying battle to eliminate the living dead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Maybe she was just exhausted from all the stress, Melin thought, trying to comfort herself, and closed her eyes, quickly drifting off to sleep.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She didn't know how long she slept, but when she woke, it was already evening.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The room was dim, and the streetlights outside had just flickered on. Melin suddenly felt bloated and needed to use the bathroom. She found the toilet was broken.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Damn it! I forgot to have it fixed."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Shaking her head, she decided to use the public bathroom outside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She rubbed her temples, her head heavy and foggy, as if it had been stuffed with glue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Melin hurried downstairs and headed toward the shared restroom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This was the police dormitory building, with the police station just ahead, so Melin felt completely at ease. Aside from feeling exhausted, there was nothing that seemed out of place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The public restroom was quiet, the dim yellow light casting a faint glow. There wasn't a soul around.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Melin rubbed her temples as she walked into the women's restroom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>There were several stalls, all with their doors closed, and no sounds coming from inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Melin chose the outermost stall and gently pushed the door open.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Not long after, the soft sound of water could be heard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After finishing, Melin felt much lighter. Suddenly, faint footsteps echoed from outside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Tap, tap...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Two quiet steps, and then silence again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At first, Melin thought it was someone else coming in, but soon, she realized something was off. Everything was too quiet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Who's out there?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Melin asked, puzzled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But no one responded. Seconds passed, and the restroom remained eerily silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Tap, tap...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The footsteps came again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This is Melin. Who's out there?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Melin raised her voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Still, there was no response. The silence stretched on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Melin's face changed. She wondered if it could have been a hallucination or if she had imagined the sound.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Who's out there? This is Melin!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She called out again, not willing to give up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Again, there was no reply. Melin suddenly felt a chill down her spine and quickly stood up to fasten her pants.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Just as she was about to open the door, a pale hand reached under the partition, holding a sharp black trident dagger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Without thinking, Melin jumped up onto the toilet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Bang!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A flash of cold light and the toilet was sliced into pieces by the sharp dagger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Melin froze in shock. If she hadn't moved quickly, her legs might have been gone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Fuming with anger, she kicked the stall door with all her strength. It flew off its hinges and slammed to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But outside, there was no one. It was as if everything that had just happened was a mere illusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Melin rushed out, shouting angrily, "Stop hiding! Come out now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was dead silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Determined, Melin kicked the door of the stall next to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Crash!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The door flew open and slammed against the wall. The stall was empty, not even a shadow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Melin kicked open stall after stall, relentlessly searching for any clues.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When she reached the last stall, the door was ajar, but once again, it was completely empty. There was no sign of the attacker.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She wondered if it could be a ghost.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Suddenly, Melin felt her throat tighten, and a cold chill ran down her spine.</span></p><div class="pagination">
