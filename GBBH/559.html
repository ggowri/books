  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gamblers from all corners of the world filled the casino, their spirits high.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barry, too, was bursting with excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His breathing grew heavy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Several casino staff members in uniform took positions in each corner of the hall, their eyes discreetly trained on Barry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>High-definition cameras mounted on the ceiling also zoomed in on him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Felix, go exchange another 50 million dollars in chips," Barry urged, eager for more bets.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Morris, you've already lost 100 million today. Betting more is just giving money to the casino. I really can't afford this," Felix pleaded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barry snapped, "Shut up! You're balking over a measly hundred million? You're the head of the Red Umbrella Group. Coughing up a few hundred million should be a walk in the park.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you don't want me to help you deal with Alexander, then forget it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beside them, Diego snorted, "Go! How dare you disobey our master?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix had no choice but to exchange the chips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this rate, his fortune would drain in no time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't let me catch you slipping," he muttered under his breath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before the chips even arrived, Barry was already striding toward the roulette table.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes were glued to the spinning wheel. Anyone could place a bet as the wheel spun.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The dealer was excited to see Barry approaching.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She smiled warmly and asked, "Sir, would you like to place a bet?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course, I would," Barry answered confidently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, the 50-million-dollar chips arrived.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix watched the towering pile with regret.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barry was bound to lose.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Be it 50 million or five billion, Barry would lose it all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Felix needed him and Alexander to destroy each other, so he held his tongue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The chips, arranged on a large tray, were stacked high, each silver chip worth a million dollars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it were gold, each would be worth ten million.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barry quickly grabbed a one-million-dollar chip and threw it on number 18.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He then stared at the spinning roulette wheel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The dealer, flashing a seductive smile, noted the hefty sum.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She nudged a specific tile under the table with her toe. The alarm in the surveillance room went off instantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The surveillance room on the top floor spanned thousands of square feet, an open space filled with rows upon rows of desks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each was equipped with LCD monitors, while an entire wall displayed a massive screen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hundreds of employees monitored the casino's thousand-plus high-definition cameras, keeping a close eye on every move within the building.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barry, oblivious, was already under three-dimensional surveillance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Master, I didn't expect you'd take an interest in Barry," said a middle-aged man in a suit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was having a video call with Nancy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes were fixed on the screen showing Felix. "What would you like me to do next?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy smirked. "Drain them dry. Don't let them walk out of here easily."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The middle-aged man replied confidently, "Don't worry, Master. I'll make sure Barry gets so hooked he won't leave until he's lost his shirt."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix, unaware he was being monitored, kept a nervous watch on Barry's bets.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He would've never imagined himself feeling such anxiety over gambling chips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was all Alexander's fault.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hatred seethed within him. He wished he could take out his half-brother right then and there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for Barry, he was no more than a naive amateur, gambling purely on luck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He placed bet after bet, only to lose repeatedly.</span></p><div class="pagination">
