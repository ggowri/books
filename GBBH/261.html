  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The huge ship weighed anchor from the dock and slowly sailed away from Treasure Island.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander stood on the deck, gazing at the Treasure Island gradually disappearing into the distance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for the yacht he brought here, it would remain on the island for the time being.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alice snuggled quietly beside Alexander. She was filled with a sense of security and happiness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ever since they had slept together, Alice had become more loyal to Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though everything Alexander was doing now had gone beyond the principles set by the Godfather, she had no intention of telling the truth. Instead, she was thinking about how to help cover it up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, several malicious people were staring at Alice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander had already sensed it and looked over pretending not to care. They were sailors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They didn't know Alexander's true identity and thought he was a good choice to be rubbed, especially Alice, who was dressed sexy and hot, making them excited.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One of them was a bald man in his thirties with a muscular body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That woman has a nice figure, big breasts, and a nice butt. She was much better than the average woman! When we arrived, we threw that man into the sea to feed the </span><span>fish."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thin man next to him frowned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said, "Jair Cater, this guy dared to break into Treasure Island alone with such a beautiful woman. I'm afraid he's not simple, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jair snorted disdainfully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He must be the prodigal son of some big shot. Otherwise, how could we choose him? But don't worry. We have many people on the boat. Don't leave any clues. Everything will be fine."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thin man was still trying to persuade him, but Jair had already asked his men to walk to Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Boy, we don't have enough people on the ship, and we need your help. Come with us."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander looked at him coldly. He thought, "This guy was plotting against me. Is he courting death?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing that Alexander didn't say anything, Jair thought he was frightened and sneered at him contemptuously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Boy, your girlfriend is pretty. Come with us to the cabin to help, or I'll throw you into the sea to feed the sharks!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jair threatened Alexander unscrupulously and poked Alexander's chest with his finger in a very arrogant manner.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander looked at him expressionlessly, having secretly sentenced this guy to death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Go!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They urged Alexander and Alice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alice looked at Alexander with interest. Seeing that he had no expression on his face, she knew that Alexander was angry and these people were in big trouble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She couldn't help but giggle. Her snow-white breasts trembled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jair and the others were attracted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They thought, "Such a sexy and charming woman was in no way inferior to those supermodels and big stars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander looked calm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay, let's go. You lead the way."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing how cooperative Alexander was, Jair immediately despised his incompetence and cowardice even more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thin man said enviously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Jair, you will be the first one. Don't forget us."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course, as long as you listen to me, I will give you a share of everything if I am happy."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jair made the promise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Several men looked at Alice greedily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jair led the way in front, and the others surrounded Alexander and Alice. The group walked towards the cabin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alice snuggled in Alexander's arms. Her slender waist and round buttocks twisted coquettishly, which immediately aroused their wild thoughts and made them burn with desire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was obvious that Alice did it on purpose. She wanted to arouse their desire and then let Alexander hit them harder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Little slut!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander couldn't help but pinch her butt hard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alice was excited.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She couldn't help but touch Alexander's private place. Thinking of how she was bullied by this guy and almost couldn't get out of bed, she suddenly felt numb all over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two of them caressed and kissed each other as if no one was around, which made Jair and the others very angry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She is such a slut. I will give her a good lesson later!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jair muttered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The group gradually entered the depths of the cabin and came to a large warehouse. There was no cargo piled here and it seemed very empty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander and Alice were calm. They continued to kiss and touch each other deliberately. Jair could no longer bear it.</span></p><div class="pagination">
