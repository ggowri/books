  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Hello!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Keith was greeted by a young female receptionist who was wearing a sexy black business suit, crystal-smooth stockings, and high heels. Seeing her, he couldn't help but feel thrilled and take a few more glances at her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The beauty was exceptionally polite, which made Keith, who had been hated before, very excited and even more grateful to Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was Alexander who changed the trajectory of his life!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After Keith completed the formalities, he was led by the staff into a large room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Over a dozen men in various work attire filled the room, each embodying distinct role.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The man in the white overalls was the lowest-ranking supporting role, and he was not even allowed to touch the actress' body without permission.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Keith's black suit, embodying the male lead, drew everyone's gaze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>For the first time, he felt envied, and suddenly a sense of superiority.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Several men bowed and nodded to him politely. Keith just nodded slightly, then sat calmly in the chair, waiting for the director to call him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Robinson, here are your coffee and snacks. Take care."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The female receptionist offered Keith coffee and delicate snacks with exceptional politeness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The supporting roles didn't get any such treatment and could only stare with their eyes wide open.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Oh, this is real life..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Keith sighed and sipped his coffee slowly but could not calm down for a long time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After waiting for a few minutes, a middle-aged fat man came in, wearing a blue uniform representing the director.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Good morning, everyone! I'm Harold Murphy, the director, in charge of this shoot. Let me introduce the plot to you first."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Harold gave a slight bow, passed out plot summaries, and started detailing the shoot's plot on the adjacent LCD screen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The film depicted a female teacher abducted by fugitives and held in a filthy warehouse, subjected to sexual assaults.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the end, she was tortured into becoming a nymphomaniac and could only be corrupted forever.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The filming location was in the studio on the sixth floor. Due to the plot requirements, there were seven supporting roles to cooperate with Keith, the male lead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Only Keith could have sex with the female lead, while others could only surround her and touch her a few times.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The plot of the porn film was straightforward and did not stand up to scrutiny, but people who watched this kind of movie were definitely not watching it mainly for the plot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Keith observed the plot, thinking about how he should act later. It was his first time as the male lead, so he would not allow any mistakes, and he had to perform at a very high level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Harold focused on Keith and formed a favorable impression of his serious demeanor during the plot explanation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As a director, even though he was making a porn movie, he wanted his actors to take it seriously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After being familiar with the plot, the staff led Keith and other supporting actors to the studio.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before starting the shoot, everyone must clean themselves according to the rules, such as washing their hair, taking a shower, cutting their nails, brushing their teeth, etc.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, everyone was given prison uniforms, befitting their status as escaped prisoners.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After a meticulous cleanup and donning his prison attire, Keith had makeup applied promptly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Only the male and female leads had the special treatment of wearing makeup.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After fixing his hair, drawing a few scars on his face, and casting shadows on his cheeks, Keith immediately looked ferocious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, Keith and the cast entered the lounge, awaiting the shoot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon, the female lead of this film came.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ah! It's Ms. Amira Barnes!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At the sight of the female lead, Keith stood up excitedly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The same went for the supporting roles. Some of them even opened their mouths so wide that they were almost drooling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Amira's fair skin, tiny face, watery eyes, straight nose, and sexy red lips gave her a striking allure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Especially her sexy figure, with curves in all the right places. Her long legs were revealed under her black miniskirt, her round and perky buttocks swaying with her steps, which was incredibly charming.</span></p><div class="pagination">
