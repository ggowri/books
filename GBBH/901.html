  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying this, even Alexander himself laughed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eamonn was a fool. He didn't know that Alexander had wiped out the Mafia branch and Locke had gone to hell.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing that Alexander didn't say anything, Eamonn laughed triumphantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you scared now? Let me tell you! Mr. Welsh, the Mafia member, is a top expert. You are definitely no match for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You dared to hit me just now? Come on! I'm going to break both of your hands."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eamonn shouted arrogantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Norma was a little confused and didn't know why Alexander said that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Walsh! There is a group of Mafia members outside... The leader is a woman who claims to be the lady of the Mafia, Vivian Hawkins... She specifically asked to see you..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Someone rushed in from outside to report, looking a little nervous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eamonn was immediately overjoyed, waving his hands in triumph and laughing wildly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Did you see that? The Mafia's lady is here, proving that they value their cooperation with me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Norma, Give up your seat to me. There is still a way to survive."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The atmosphere in the hall became tense and silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Norma chuckled, ignored him, and looked at Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander said calmly, "It's okay. Let them in."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing what Alexander said, she immediately understood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this time, the top leaders of the Walsh family immediately split into two factions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Most of them were still standing on Norma's side, and the remaining small number had already stood behind Eamonn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Eamonn, you are inviting a wolf into the house. This is betrayal to the family!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes! The Walsh family is not vulnerable. Norma is the gang leader and family head we chose. Whether or not to cooperate with the Mafia should be decided by her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Walsh, I will gather people immediately and fight the Mafia!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone was emotional.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Some people were Norma's confidants, while others admired her fair handling of family affairs as the head of the family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander waved his hand and said, "Don't waste time. Let them in."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing what Alexander said, they were all stunned. This was the Walsh family. How could an outsider have the right to give orders?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Norma urged unhappily, "Let them in. Didn't you hear him?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The senior executives who supported Norma were speechless. It seemed that she was fascinated by this man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander took a puff of his cigarette and tapped the ash on the ashtray.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Of course, he knew what Vivian was here for because it was the plan he had arranged.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Norma felt a little nervous but also full of hope, believing that Alexander would not give up on her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this time, Vivian and her group came in one after another.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eamonn didn't see Locke, so he immediately went up to Vivian and asked, "Ms. Hawkins, where is Mr. Welsh? Why didn't he come for such an important matter?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get out of my way!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vivian pushed him away without any hesitation, not giving him any face at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Miss, where is Mr. Welsh? Why didn't he come?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unwilling to give up, Eamonn continued to ask.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I said get out!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vivian pushed him away fiercely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eamonn became flustered. No matter how stupid he was, he knew that something must have happened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vivian wore a sexy black miniskirt, flesh-colored stockings, and high heels, and her plump figure was very charming.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't even pay attention to Norma but walked towards Alexander with a smile, twisting her hips with pretentious paces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne, according to your order, I am willing to form an alliance with Norma to fight against the Sakra Society together."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What Vivian said was shocking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The hall was so quiet that they could even hear a pin drop.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone in the Walsh family focused their attention on Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The complex glances were filled with shock, confusion, and profound disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This man could actually order the Mafia's lady around?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander responded calmly, "Very good. I believe that it won't be long before you are not just the eldest daughter, but the sole heir to the Mafia."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Who on earth was this guy? How could he say such stupid things?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone was stunned.</span></p><div class="pagination">
