  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was as if it was not a solid fortress but a piece of delicious fat meat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This fortress was the command center of the Jedi City. After thousands of years of operation, it had robust defenses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The walls are covered with Force cannons and various defensive weapons.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sky was gray, and the remaining two thousand people in the Jedi City were there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The armors were covered with dents and cracks and stained with blood, but they were still strong.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The light of the Lightsabers had dimmed, but they were still extremely sharp.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The only worry was these last two thousand Warriors. The worst of them were Advanced, and most of them were Experts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were exhausted, but the Warriors would never lower their proud heads.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone had a blank expression on their face, and no one backed down,</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They gripped their Lightsabers tightly, and their angry, cold, and slightly sad eyes stared at the terrifying orcs that were approaching and spreading all over the mountains.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These orcs had ferocious faces, were over nine feet tall, and had immense strength, and the animal skins covering their bodies were comparable to the hardest armor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The most terrifying was that their pain sensitivity was dull, so they were not afraid of death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The million-strong orc army had lost more than 200,000 of them, which was paid for by the lives of 8,000 Warriors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Outside the fortress, the orcs were shouting wildly, but on the top of the city, there was total silence!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The oppressive atmosphere of the approaching decisive battle was like the dark clouds in the sky.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander suddenly found himself standing on the wall, tightly gripping the atomic crossbow in his hand, his handsome face still somewhat childish.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sharp eyebrows, bright eyes, a high nose bridge, and angular lips, this was himself in his dreams.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was the son of the city lord, Edgar Lester. He just turned eighteen this year and this was his first time to go to the battlefield.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Edgar had a nervous expression on his face. There were too many orcs, and they were everywhere in the mountains.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They held terrifying maces, giant axes, and machetes in their hands and rode various ferocious beasts such as war wolves, porcupines, crocodiles, etc.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't be afraid, son. You are my descendant, and you have noble blood flowing in your body!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus patted his youngest son, his white hair and beard fluttering in the wind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry, Dad. There are only Warriors who die standing, and no losers who live on their knees!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Edgar's young face was full of determination.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Good boy!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus praised his son and his eyes became moist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They stared at the orcs, who were getting closer and closer to the fortress, their eyes full of contempt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Edgar was a little anxious. He could already see the ugly faces of the orcs and wondered why his father hadn't given the order to fire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't know if he could still survive. Freya was looking forward to his return...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Freya was so beautiful... He wondered if he could see her again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Edgar was thinking wildly in his mind, and a happy smile couldn't help but appear on the corner of his mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Load!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, he heard a roar and woke up immediately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He quickly and skillfully loaded an arrow into the atomic crossbow. When the arrow was loaded, it immediately emitted a dazzling light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Edgar raised the crossbow with both hands and aimed at the orc in front.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus was not panicked at all. He raised his arm and ordered in a loud voice, "Hold on! Hold on! Fire!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thousands of arrows flew out in response, tearing through the air and then plummeting down like a storm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, hundreds of Force cannons spewed out beams of light, which fell among the orcs and created balls of light that shot up into the sky.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Miserable screams came one after another from the orcs, and the light directly vaporized more orcs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Projectile!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Free Fire!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus commanded the battle calmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Edgar secretly glanced at his father. His wrinkled face now seemed a dozen years younger, and his eyes were full of murderous intent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Edgar was already very familiar with the atomic crossbow in his hand. Arrows of light whizzed out and pierced through the bodies of the orcs one by one.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Edgar was particularly delighted to see these beasts falling one by one.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This arrow was to avenge his elder brother!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The second was to avenge his second sister, who cared about him the most!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The third was for his uncle!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The fourth arrow was for every friend who died in battle!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The fifth was for the glory of the Warriors...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Edgar's face turned pale due to excessive use of the atomic crossbow in a short period, which led to excessive use of the Force.</span></p><div class="pagination">
