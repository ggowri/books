  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Norma was like a peeled banana, with her sexy and graceful body fully revealed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her plump breasts were trembling, and her slender waist and round, full buttocks were highly charming.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The image of them entangling together emerged in Alexander's mind, and he swallowed involuntarily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But he remained calm and did not take the initiative to walk into the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He was absolutely sure that as long as he went in, Norma would not refuse and would even Cooperate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Alexander was like a patient fisherman, waiting for Norma to throw herself into his arms. Otherwise, why would she change into such sexy clothes?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After a while, the door opened slightly, and Norma's shy voice rang out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne, could you please come in and help me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander stood up, pushed the door open with a smile, and immediately saw a different Norma.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She was wearing a long dress just now, but now she had changed into a sexy uniform.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The white shirt on her upper body was apparently one size too small, and it wrapped and squeezed her plump breasts so tightly that they seemed about to jump out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The black miniskirt only reached the top of the thighs, and half of the butt could definitely be seen when she walked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>There were also black fishnet stockings, and her snow-white legs could be seen through the mesh, inducing Alexander to touch them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Well... Mr. Hawthorne, does this outfit look good on me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Norma asked shyly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A blush appeared on her delicate face, and she looked at Alexander with her big, watery eyes, making her particularly seductive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander smiled slightly, "Sure."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Norma was like a ripe peach, exuding an enticing fragrance and offering herself to him, tempting him to take a big bite.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Norma looked straight at Alexander and said, "Mr. Hawthorne, thank you for saving me! If you can help me deal with Sean, I can agree to any conditions you have."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander didn't say much but took her into his arms and kissed her directly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ms. Walsh, you are seducing me on purpose, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Norma subconsciously wanted to escape but was held tightly by Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She panted and asked, "Will you help me confront Sean? I know you are a man of your word and you will definitely do what you say."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander kissed her earlobe and said, "Ms. Walsh, I can agree to your terms. However, we have to deal not only with Sean, but also with the Sakra Society. What do you say?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Norma's eyes lit up immediately, and she agreed without hesitation, "Okay!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander reached out to unbutton her clothes but was stopped by Norma.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Alexander, I've never had a man before... I'm a little afraid of pain..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Don't be afraid. I'll be gentle."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander comforted her and hugged her again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Norma wrapped her arms around Alexander's neck obediently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander picked her up, placed her on the bed, and then gently took off her white shirt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As it was unbuttoned, her bound and plump breasts immediately popped out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They were revealed pink and tender, and it was obvious that no one had touched them. Otherwise, pigmentation would have occurred.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander reached down and helped her take off the black miniskirt, revealing a pink thong.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The thin laces had been embedded in the crack of her buttocks and were slightly moist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her seductive secret garden bloomed utterly in front of Alexander. He smelled Norma's body fragrance and felt thrilled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander grabbed her breasts with both hands, began to knead them gently, and occasionally leaned over to kiss them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ah! It's itchy. Come on..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Norma couldn't help but moan when being caressed like this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As Alexander rubbed and played with her breasts, her delicate gasps became louder and louder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Hmm... Um..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Norma's desire was gradually growing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ms. Walsh, your body is really sensitive..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander grinned and fondled her chest with one hand while the other began tending to her hidden garden.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ah! Don't..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Norma instinctively squeezed her thighs together, trying to protect the most critical part of her body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Alexander quickly slid across the gradually moist part, stroking it gently.</span></p><div class="pagination">
