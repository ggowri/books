  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Grace learned about the incident, she immediately pestered her grandfather, Gavin, to intervene, asking him to contact Jermain, the ancestor of the Vanderbilt family, to negotiate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gavin was the second most powerful figure in Avalora and a top leader in the Ghost organization.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jermain, on the other hand, was far inferior, merely an ordinary member.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Jermain found out about Alexander's close relationship with Grace, he was so frightened that he broke into a cold sweat and kept apologizing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, Alexander received a phone call from Gunter, the head of the Vanderbilt family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gunter apologized repeatedly over the phone and prepared a generous gift as an apology to Alexander while also promising that they would never cause trouble again over Skyla and her son's matters.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After hanging up the phone, Alexander could only laugh wryly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had originally prepared for the Vanderbilt family's retaliation, but he didn't expect the issue to be resolved so easily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Was it Grace who helped you?" Ava asked with mixed emotions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had been beside him earlier and heard Gunter mention the Lawson family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smiled and nodded, "Yes, after all, Gavin needs my treatment to recover. But I didn't expect the Lawson family to be so powerful."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava nodded and sighed, "He is the second most powerful figure in Avalora, a superpower. How is your relationship with Grace? She came to see me before, asking me to leave you and give you to her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?" Alexander became angry upon hearing this. Just as he was about to question Grace, Ava stopped him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why are you so impatient? The Lawson family is so powerful. Aren't you afraid of offending Gavin?" Ava shot him a glance and chided him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anyway, you have so many women. One more Grace doesn't matter. As long as you love me the most, I won't mind."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander grinned foolishly, pulling Ava into his arms and caressing her plump and voluptuous buttocks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're such a sensible honey. Don't worry, I love you the most, and no other woman can compare to you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're just full of sweet talk, but you never say when you'll marry me..." Ava cooed flirtatiously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander directly covered her red lips, greedily sucking on them and exchanging saliva with her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"After we deal with the Sakra Society and Yinson and completely eliminate our crisis, I'll marry you..." Alexander said between kisses as he undid Ava's clothes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the buttons parted, the massive&nbsp;pair of breasts sprang out, trembling slightly and looking extremely enticing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah," Ava gasped as Alexander took a bite.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not only did Alexander nibble and bite, but he also grabbed one with each hand, greedily playing with them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One of Alexander's hands couldn't fully encompass Ava's breasts. He squeezed and molded them into various shapes, and seeing this, Alexander's desire was already uncontrollable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Be gentle. It hurts..." Ava cooed, but she excitedly reached into Alexander's pants and tightly gripped his erect member.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The terrifying size shocked Ava, and she felt the phallus grow even stronger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's really scary," Ava thought inwardly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She skillfully played with the hard object, sometimes twirling it, sometimes squeezing, and sometimes stroking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander took a deep breath, thinking, "This little vixen's technique is getting better."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He undid his pants and pressed Ava's head toward his abdomen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava didn't hesitate or show any disgust. She opened her sexy red lips and swallowed it whole.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the sound of swallowing echoed, Alexander closed his eyes in pleasure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His hands continued to roam over Ava's sensual body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both of them indulged in their desires.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, the room was filled with enticing moans, the crisp sound of flesh slapping, and the alluring sound of water.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the hallway, Charlize was eavesdropping intently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, she felt her body go limp, and she couldn't help but place her hands on her own breasts and start moving them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before she knew it, several tens of minutes had passed, and the moans inside suddenly stopped, followed by a high-pitched cry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The room fell silent, completely quiet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Charlize's breathing became rapid, her body burning hot, and her legs uncontrollably trembled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as she was about to relax, the door suddenly opened, and Alexander grabbed her and pulled her inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The room soon resounded with the sounds of indulgence once more.</span></p><div class="pagination">
