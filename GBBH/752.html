Charlize's face flushed, and she tried hard to pull her legs back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander could control her with just his hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Charlize cried out in surprise as Alexander directly pulled her into his arms, holding her tightly against him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Immediately, Charlize's pretty face turned red, and her body felt numb and feverish.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her butt pressed against Alexander's lower abdomen, and she could feel him becoming aroused. Immediately, she felt weak all over and collapsed in his arms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander, with a grin, whispered in her ear, "You have become more sensitive."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Charlize felt even more embarrassed, too shy to lift her head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All the team members were all stunned and stood there in a daze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They admired Charlize in their hearts, but it was just a secret crush; at most, they would have an intimate encounter with her in their dreams.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander now directly held Charlize in his arms, not at all like they were just exchanging techniques. They seemed to have sex.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Charlize's large, watery eyes gazed at Alexander, her look incredibly alluring.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sir, what do you want to do in front of so many people?" she said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander laughed heartily and reached out to touch Charlize's thigh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Everyone, look closely at the spot I'm pointing to. Why was I able to quickly subdue Ms. Collins? Now, I'll tell you: it's important to learn how to use skillful force, to overcome strength with weakness."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, Alexander continued to caress Charlize's leg.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Collins' leg muscles are quite powerful, and the synergy between her muscle groups is extremely strong, at least several times that of an ordinary person."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's fingers moved as if playing a piano, pinpointing the key areas on Charlize's leg.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said, "When the calf muscle group and the thigh muscle group work together, combined with strong tendons and bones, and the waist muscles also exert force, it can unleash the greatest power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But, I preemptively cut off the muscle group coordination of Ms. Collins just now, so I was able to easily control her!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you understand? Whether it's wrestling or combat, it's not always the strongest who wins, but rather the one who knows how to disrupt the opponent's muscle group coordination and seize the initiative!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
