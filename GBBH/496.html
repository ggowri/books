  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yohan was so angry that his face turned red. Then, he stretched out his arms and stood in front of the operating table.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're talking nonsense! Anyway, I won't violate medical ethics, I won't kill anyone, and I won't allow you to touch this little girl."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul had lost his patience and angrily shouted, "Get out! If you don't want to, just get out. Don't delay us from making money. Liam, you will take Yohan's position. After you are done, I will recommend you as the deputy director of surgery."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing that, Liam Harrison showed a surprised expression. Obviously, he couldn't resist the temptation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He gritted his teeth, put on gloves, and prepared to pick up the scalpel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Paul, don't worry, and I will definitely cooperate with you. Can we get started?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yohan pushed Liam away with force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you crazy? This is murder. You are murderers! The patient is still alive, and you want to dissect her alive. Are you still human?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul angrily said, "You don't do it, but do you still stop us? Have you ever thought about the consequences of offending the Red Umbrella Group?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get out of here right now, or I'll make your life miserable!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yohan remained unmoved and still stood in front of the operating table.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As long as I'm alive, I will never allow you to kill people in the hospital!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul punched Yohan hard in the face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You ungrateful bastard! Tie him up and hand him over to the Red Umbrella Group after the operation. You idiot, you don't want to make a lot of money, but you're actually going against the Red Umbrella Group."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Two men rushed up, dragged Yohan to a corner, and started beating and kicking him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're really ungrateful."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul spat at him and ordered, "Liam, time is running out. Let's start the autopsy quickly. The rest of you should record the data. This is a new type of genetic medicine, so we must be careful."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The people from the Red Umbrella Group immediately turned on a dark instrument and connected it to Ashley's arm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul picked up the scalpel, pointed it at Ashley, who was lying there, and cut it without hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, there was a loud sound, and the heavy metal door was kicked into the air and smashed heavily to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A figure appeared like lightning and grabbed Paul's wrist at the critical moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The scalpel was only 0.4 inches away from Ashley's belly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who are you? Let me go!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul struggled hard but found that his hands were clamped tightly by a pair of clamps, and he could not move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the clamps continued to contract, severe pain came, accompanied by crisp sounds of bones breaking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah! It hurts, it hurts so much. Please let me go! Please, let me go..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul was in so much pain that he couldn't stop crying and wailed loudly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander looked at him, his eyes as cold as ice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you deserve to be a doctor like this trash?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul's face was full of pain, and he stammered, "You...you should let me go! Otherwise, the Red Umbrella Group will not let you go. You should know the Red Umbrella Group, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Several people from the Red Umbrella Group nearby came to their senses and rushed toward Alexander like hyenas.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get lost!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander waved his hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Several people felt as if a huge hammer had hit them hard in the chest. They vomited </span><span>blood and fell to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul was still threatening, "You broke into the operating room without permission and injured someone. You will be jailed for life!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander sneered, "Do you want to dissect my daughter and put me in jail?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul's face suddenly changed. Was he actually the father of this little girl?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, he immediately changed his approach and tempted him, saying, "As long as you let me go, I will let her go and pretend that this never happened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Or I can give you five million dollars, and I will perform the autopsy as planned. As long as you have the money, you can have as many daughters as you want. How do you think?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Paul saw that Alexander didn't say anything, he thought he was moved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He grabbed Paul's hand and twisted it in the opposite direction. With a snap, his wrist broke, and even the bone was exposed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul's shrill howls echoed in the operating room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's anger had already reached its peak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A scumbag like you shouldn't be alive in this world, let alone be the chief of surgery."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He grabbed Paul's other hand and twisted it.</span></p><div class="pagination">
