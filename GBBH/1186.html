  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The gang of twenty-plus thugs perked up with excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One of them leered at Cloe, and his eyes roved hungrily over her. "Hey Rico, she's smoking hot. How about we have some fun before we mess her up?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A cruel smile spread across Rico's face. "Sure, why not?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the thugs started creeping closer, Alexander's voice boomed across the clearing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Everyone else might as well come out! Quit playing hide and seek. It's just the two of us here. Are you seriously that scared? Get your asses out here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's voice carried the Force, sending invisible shockwaves that made the trees shudder and kicked up clouds of dust everywhere.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rico and his men stumbled backward, clutching their ears in agony. The blast nearly deafened them on the spot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Holy shit," they thought. None of them had expected Alexander to pack this kind of punch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Cloe stood right next to Alexander without so much as flinching.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She ducked behind him, wrapping her arms tight around his.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander shot her a playful grin, deliberately brushing against her breasts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey! This is so not the time for that!" Cloe scolded with a bright blush, though she didn't exactly pull away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her face was burning red, but her grip stayed firm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, come on out," Alexander called out, and his voice dripped with disdain. "One in the shed, one behind that big tree up front, another behind those rocks on the right. Three snipers? Seriously? You guys must be absolutely terrified of me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His casual confidence left Rico completely stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Three snipers were hidden away</span><span>&mdash;</span><span>that was Rico's ace in the hole. He always loved keeping a trump card up his sleeve, but Alexander had called it out before they could even make their move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How the hell had he spotted them? The guy was seriously something else.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The three snipers in their camo gear were still reeling. They stared at Alexander like they'd seen a ghost.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rico's face twisted into an ugly grin. "Well, well... unless you can sprout wings and fly, you're screwed now. Get him, guys!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, dozens of thugs whipped out their weapons</span><span>&mdash;</span><span>everything from guns to machetes and axes</span><span>&mdash;</span><span>closing in with murder in their eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You idiots!" Alexander's eyes narrowed dangerously. "Anyone holding a gun dies first."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The temperature seemed to drop as a wave of killing intent rolled off Alexander, filling the air with a bone-chilling pressure. Everyone there felt their hearts skip a beat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Quit trying to act tough! I'll break your damn leg!" One of the guys couldn't take the tension anymore. His hand shaking around his pistol, he aimed at Alexander and pulled the trigger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Two gunshots cracked through the air, and the bullets screamed straight at Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The shooter smirked, feeling cocky. He'd gotten the jump on his target</span><span>&mdash;</span><span>no way Alexander was walking away from this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Any second now, he expected to see Alexander hit the ground, bleeding out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead, an agonized scream pierced the air</span><span>&mdash;</span><span>but not from Alexander. The gunman was the one howling in pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander hadn't even flinched. The bullets were nowhere to be seen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone else had been itching for action, but now they froze like deer in headlights.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What they'd just witnessed was straight-up terrifying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My eyes! Oh, my eyes!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The shooter's screams were gut-wrenching. His eye sockets were a bloody mess, both eyeballs destroyed by what looked like small stones. His gun was long gone, dropped somewhere in the chaos.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The poor bastard clutched his face, and blood streamed between his fingers as he writhed on the ground in agony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rico and his crew were hardcore pirates who'd seen it all, but right now, they were shaking in their boots, staring at Alexander like they'd seen a ghost.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was so fast, so brutal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How the hell did you dodge those bullets?" Rico finally managed to ask, "And why'd you have to take his eyes? If you're such a badass, why not just kill him? Why make him suffer like that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rico was really playing the victim card now, acting all righteous as he confronted Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Am I cruel? That's rich coming from a bunch of pirates with blood on their hands trying to steal my Treasure Island."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander couldn't help but laugh. "Oh, you haven't seen cruel yet. Wait till I gouge out the eyes of every single one of you idiots. That'll stop you from hurting anyone else."</span></p><div class="pagination">
