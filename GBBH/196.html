I don't want to die. Just tell me what you want me to do..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was truly scared out of his wits, lacking any will to resist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander chuckled.

Alexander pushed Edward into the car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He checked the </span><span>clock</span><span>; it was already 4 AM, and although it was still raining, it had lightened up considerably.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander looked out the window at the hellish scene outside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He ordered Augusta to drive while the others quickly cleaned up the scene.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With hundreds injured or dead, if not handled properly, it would cause a nationwide stir.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fortunately, the heavy rain had washed away most of the evidence, and once they finished cleaning, there would be no traces left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Augusta drove as fast as she could toward the Federer family estate.</span></p><div class="pagination">
