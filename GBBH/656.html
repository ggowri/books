Paxton turned around cursing and saw that it was from the men he had arranged to monitor the Axe. He answered the call immediately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's the matter? Tell me now! I'm busy..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paxton was breathing heavily, but the woman did not stop. Instead, she buried her face in his crotch in an extremely flattering manner and tried even harder to please him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>An excited voice sounded, "Mr. Oldman, the guy who injured lan is out. Should we chase him?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paxton was so angry that he started to curse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you fucking stupid? Why are you asking this? Hurry up and catch him. If he dares to resist, kill him immediately."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you can't handle this, don't come back."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paxton hung up the phone directly, then pushed the woman to her knees on the bed and pounced on her like a monster in heat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, the room was filled with a woman's triumphant laughter and gasps.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander looked at the rearview mirror and saw several cars following him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He smiled calmly, not caring at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You are a bunch of rubbish. I'm going to the Glory Association today. Today is your lucky day."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander stepped on the accelerator, and the speed of the BMW increased rapidly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The cars behind saw Alexander speeding up and quickly accelerated to catch up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Alexander's reaction ability and precise control ability were much better than theirs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To Alexander, these people's driving skills were just like those of kindergarten kids.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander maneuvered the BMW through the traffic and soon left those cars behind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Two of the cars were involved in a traffic accident. One collided with a truck, and the other ran off the overpass, emitting white smoke.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Paxton's men were all elite, they were just useless trash to Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The headquarters of the Glory Association was a large community on the edge of Mandale Town.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were not only dozens of buildings inside but also supermarkets, playgrounds, and other living and entertainment facilities. The area was twice as large as the Axe's headquarters.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander parked the car in the dark and ran towards the Glory Association like a ghost in the night.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although the place was heavily guarded and had first-class security, it was useless to Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander had memorized the map of the Glory Association's headquarters, especially the residence of Jagger, the president of the Glory Association.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the cover of shadows, Alexander quietly came to the tallest building in the middle and waited patiently for the patrolling guards to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jagger lived in this building!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smiled coldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jagger was quite cunning and dug a palace underground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, no matter how well he hid, he could not escape Alexander's All-seeing Eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After the patrol team left, Alexander flashed and sneaked into the building like a ghost.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander took a glance with his All-seeing Eyes and immediately found the entrance to the underground palace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without stopping, he opened the hidden entrance and headed straight underground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The bluestone-paved passage was brightly lit, and he met several guards on the way, but before they could react, Alexander strangled them by the neck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No matter how strict the guarding was, it couldn't stop Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Glory Association was like a naked beauty, completely defenseless in front of a strong man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who is there? Who let you in?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When the sound of the door opening awakened Jagger, he was still dazed and did not react immediately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was holding a naked woman in his arms. They had just had intense sex and were sleeping soundly. They had never expected that there would be an uninvited guest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The underground palace covered an area of more than 1000 square meters. This room was the most secretive and safest, and only his most trusted confidants knew about it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even the workers and designers who built this place were brutally killed by him just to protect the secrets of this place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How could someone suddenly break in?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And there was no alarm. Where were his trusted guards outside?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Could it be that they have all been killed by Alexander?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jagger finally woke up, feeling a chill on his back and cold sweat on his forehead.</span></p><div class="pagination">
