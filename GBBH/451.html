It wasn't Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kyle quickly retreated backward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander had suddenly appeared like a specter, striking Kyle in the chest with a palm strike.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a crisp sound of breaking bones, Kyle let out a shrill scream, thrown more than ten feet away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In front of everyone, Kyle, a strong member of the Red Umbrella Group and a level-one metahuman, was defeated by Alexander in a single move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bastard!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kyle cursed, struggling to get up and fight back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander kicked him onto the ground, stepping on his chest as if crushing an ant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kyle, feeling as if his bones had been removed, could only collapse under Alexander's foot, emitting cries of agony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Vanderbilt!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How can this be... Someone help Mr. Vanderbilt. Help! Help!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The men in the room screamed in terror.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kyle, who they had regarded as </span><span>god</span><span>-like, was now being trampled underfoot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Run! Run!" someone shouted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They all turned and stumbled towards the exit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, with a flick of Alexander's hand, the Force knock on the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The door shut tightly. No matter how hard they pushed, the door wouldn't budge, as if welded shut.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What... what do you want to do? We didn't kidnap your daughter. We're not part of the Red Umbrella Group."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Please don't kill me. I have a wife and children. I just met Kyle by chance. We're not close..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They crawled before Alexander, begging for mercy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander dared to commit violence in front of them and wouldn't let them leave, which meant he had no intention of sparing them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander snorted coldly, a hint of purple flashing in his eyes. His All-seeing Eyes had been activated, scanning the eyes of several people.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next second, Kyle's cronies all became dazed, expressionlessly rigid, like wooden figures.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They fell to the ground one after another, frothing at the mouth, incontinent, and convulsing violently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A cold smile played on Alexander's lips. He hadn't killed them but had affected their mental worlds with Force Control.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When they woke up again, they wouldn't remember what had just happened, and their intelligence would greatly regress, possibly even degenerating into imbecility.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These scumbags deserved such punishment!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't pretend to be dead. Tell me. Where is my daughter? If you speak, maybe I can spare your life."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander kicked Kyle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kyle vomited blood, grinning at Alexander maliciously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You'll never find your daughter, never... I won't tell you even if I die."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kyle remained incredibly arrogant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's anger erupted like a volcano. He stomped on Kyle's right hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a series of crisp sounds, Kyle's shrill howl echoed in the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His right hand was completely ruined, without a single intact bone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Will you talk?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander stepped on Kyle's left hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With another round of cracking sounds, Kyle's left hand was also destroyed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though in unbearable pain, Kyle still said nothing. Instead, he revealed a ferocious and evil grin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing this, Alexander hesitated no more. He grabbed Kyle's head and twisted it in the opposite direction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kyle's head turned, facing backward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The expression of pain and despair on his face seemed to solidify as he died, staring with lifeless grey eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Having killed Kyle without obtaining any concrete information about Ashley, Alexander's anger intensified.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he opened the door and stepped out, the corridor was packed with security </span><span>personnel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dressed in matching black suits and wielding machetes, axes, pistols, and other weapons, they glared menacingly at Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With nowhere to vent his rage, Alexander bared a fierce grin at them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He pressed the hilt, and his resplendent Lightsaber hissed to life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next moment, brilliant beams of light blossomed in the corridor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Whether it was the sturdy machetes and axes or the fragile bodies, all were rent asunder by the Lightsaber.</span></p><div class="pagination">
