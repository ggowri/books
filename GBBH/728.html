  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bruno was so fast with the machete that everyone didn't see clearly how he split Jasper's body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The atmosphere became tense and frightening, and everyone felt panicked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dude, do you know who I am? I... I'm..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dick was stuttering out of fear and couldn't speak smoothly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Men who bully women deserve to die."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bruno looked at Dick indifferently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come on, let's go. This woman is for you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dick apologized as he stepped back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bruno ignored them as he removed the towel stuffed in Ava's mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What... What do you want?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava still looked angry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Of course</span><span> she remembered the cripple man, who was the mysterious stalker she'd told Alexander about earlier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava hadn't expected Bruno to save her, but she knew it was definitely not a coincidence, let alone Bruno's great kindness. He was surely up to something.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dick took advantage of the fact that Ava had Bruno's attention to move back faster.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop right there. Did I allow you to leave?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As if Bruno had eyes in the back of his head, he knew without looking back that Dick was trying to slip away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dick gripped his pistol tightly and sneered, "Do you think I want to escape? Well, with the distance we are now, can you be faster than a bullet?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bruno still didn't turn around and said viciously, "Since you want to die, I will send you to hell now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He turned toward Dick, and he was limping and looked kind of funny.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dick and the others, however, stopped laughing. Although they were fifteen feet away, Bruno's terrifying aura made a shiver run down their spines.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dick roared as he was the first to raise his gun, aim it at Bruno and pull the trigger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The other two had also raised their guns on Bruno.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The three men were quite tacit, and it was obvious that it wasn't the first time they had killed someone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sharp light of the machete was flashing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The three didn't even shoot before their guns had been split in half, the other half severed by Bruno's slash, shards and parts flying around.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without waiting for Dick to exclaim, his eyes suddenly blurred.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dick realized that his right hand holding the gun was separated from his body and fell to the ground, with his fingers still moving and blood gushing out like a spring.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The other two were even more miserable, with an extra bloodstain on their throats, their bodies falling heavily into a pool of blood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, is your gun faster or my machete?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bruno gave Dick the smile that he would never forget.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dick was horrified and on the verge of death as he covered his right hand in sharp pain and looked very frustrated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dick slumped down in front of Bruno, desperately begging for mercy. "Please, forgive me. I'm blind, and I'm an animal."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bruno looked calm and casually swung the machete.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dick's eyes widened as his blood rose from his throat. Then, he fell heavily into a pool of blood, his eyes filled with horror.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava had been so terrified that she turned and ran towards the villa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She stumbled, suddenly tripped, and fell heavily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Be careful!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, the man wrapped his large and strong hands around her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Alexander!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava was surprised. Then, Alexander wrapped Ava in a warm embrace, and she just felt incredibly relieved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander had just finished his meditation. Then, he realized something was wrong, so he immediately rushed out to help Ava who had fallen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He slowly turned around with Ava in his arms and looked at Bruno with a deep gaze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bruno's eyes, which had been somewhat lost, became surprised, and he looked right into Alexander's eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava said in a hurry, "He's the mysterious weirdo who's been following me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, I came here specifically to see you," Bruno said indifferently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You were the one who killed someone at the airport, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander glanced at Bruno and thought, "This guy is truly a powerful man."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bruno's eyes were filled with murderous intent and a hint of jealousy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, you shouldn't provoke the Mafia, much less be an asshole. Now are you going to kill yourself or do you want me to help you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I think you'd better kill yourself. If I help you, you'll suffer even more."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bruno was confident and looked fierce.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at the young man of his age, Alexander smiled slightly, "Are you from the Mafia? If you want to target me, you should see if you are capable of that."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How dare you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Bruno suddenly rushed forward with his machete.</span></p><div class="pagination">
