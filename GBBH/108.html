Mr. Gellar is my opportunity," Jane declared, her eyes wide with hatred and greed for </span><span>money</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What she didn't realize was that this Mr. Gellar, Jackson Gellar, would soon bring catastrophic trouble to the Fairfax family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the conference approached, the magic powder was not only </span><span>growing popular</span><span> in </span><span>Loscity</span><span> but also across </span><span>Ca</span><span>ri</span><span>fona</span><span> and beyond.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While it wasn't as expensive as drugs, its effects were far </span><span>greater</span><span>, and, most importantly, it </span><span>did no harm</span><span> to the body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This made magic powder a darling of the elite and </span><span>even </span><span>a craze among the </span><span>public</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Top experts were using advanced technology to analyze the composition of magic powder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But</span><span> their attempts to replicate it based on its structural components were futile, driving scientists into a frenzy of frustration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a hospital room, Jane </span><span>wore a</span><span> smug smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Sebastian Tate, I'm here representing the Fairfax family to discuss a partnership with the Brilliant Group."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan</span><span>'s expression darkened, and he snapped, "You bitch! Do you even know your place?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You think you're qualified to negotiate with my dad?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Jane could respond, Sebastian slapped her hard across the face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stumbling back, Jane clutched her cheek.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian had been on edge, waiting for the dark sorcerer to arrive in </span><span>Loscity</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The last thing he wanted was Jane barging in with her ridiculous proposal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he raised his hand again, Jane quickly </span><span>explained</span><span>, "Mr. Tate, I know Mr. Gellar, the creator of magic powder!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And my sister Felicity is engaged to him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What? Are you serious?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian's mood shifted instantly, a genuine smile for Jane breaking across his face for the first time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan was excited</span><span>, too. Both </span><span>of them</span><span> realized </span><span>what Jane would bring them</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Jane, you need to talk to Mr. Gellar about making the Brilliant Group the main distributor of magic powder. We won't let you down!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan</span><span>'</span><span>s</span><span> enthusiasm was unprecedented.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian even bowed slightly to Jane.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm sorry for my earlier outburst. If we can secure that distribution deal, I'll make you the Vice President of the Brilliant Group, starting with a salary of 100 million and bonuses on top of that."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane's legs trembled with excitement</span><span>. She forgot </span><span>the sting in her cheek </span><span>and answered</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Sebastian Tate, I promise I'll make sure the distribution rights </span><span>are </span><span>granted</span><span> to</span><span> the Brilliant Group!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian nodded vigorously, </span><span>taking</span><span> Jane's hand with </span><span>Evan</span><span>'</span><span>s</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a warm smile, he looked at his son and said, "</span><span> </span><span>Evan</span><span>, the moment Jane becomes Vice President is the moment you two tie the knot."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan</span><span> </span><span>understood his father's hint immediately and promised, "Don't worry, Dad. I'll always take </span><span>good </span><span>care of Jane!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane felt a rush of joy, as if she were floating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She mused, "If I become Vice President of the Brilliant Group and marry into the Tate family, I'll finally be part of the elite circle. The Fairfax family will rise with me, becoming one of the top families in </span><span>Loscity</span><span>."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her thoughts raced with visions of a bright future, leaving her dizzy with excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you, Mr. Sebastian Tate! I won't let you down!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian patted her shoulder, pleased.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get to work on this. Let me know the moment you have good news."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Absolutely!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane left, her footsteps light and full of energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once she was gone, </span><span>Evan</span><span>'s face twisted into a sneer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A mere Fairfax family bitch thinks she can soar? Dream on. If this Mr. Gellar's really is the one who develops magic powder, we need to seize the formula. Only what we control is real."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian chuckled. "Of course, we need to keep the formula in our hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But I wouldn't mind having a loyal dog in </span><span>Loscity</span><span>, and the Fairfax family would make a perfect watchdog."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Theodore added, "Don't forget about Alexander. He's the reason we're in this mess. After the conference, we need to settle the score!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
