  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>John spat out another mouthful of blood, collapsing onto the ground, gasping for air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had taken too many hits. It seemed unlikely he would survive. Blood gushed from his mouth continuously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Transfer all your savings to this account," Alexander commanded John.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As a key executive of the Brilliant Group, he must have amassed a considerable personal fortune.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>John's facial muscles twitched, his expression one of intense struggle. Money had always been his lifeblood. He was reluctant to part with it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"John, hurry up! Once the transfer is done, you can leave. Guzman will generously reward you, offering you Sebastian's position, making you the CEO of the Brilliant Group..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's voice, modulated by the Force, carried a peculiar frequency and was filled with allure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come on! Transfer the funds, and you'll soon be the CEO of the Brilliant Group, wielding immense power!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>John became agitated and took out his phone to transfer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His body trembled uncontrollably as he muttered to himself in excitement, "I'm going to be the CEO. I'm going to be the CEO..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He entered the password, and the transfer was successful!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's phone immediately vibrated with an SMS notification of the incoming billions of dollars. He couldn't help but chuckle, thinking, "John is indeed a </span><span>moneybag."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had previously spent a billion at the trading center to purchase potential potions. Now, he had not only recouped that amount from John but had also made an additional few hundred million dollars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this point, John was motionless on the ground, silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander checked the time. It was nearing two in the morning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a casual flick of his hand, pale flames engulfed John's body. Soon, under the influence of the Force, he turned to ashes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Neptune was quietly docked at the pier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This colossal cruise ship could accommodate over three thousand people, with rooms more luxurious than those in a five-star hotel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop right there! Who are you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who said you could come here? This is not a place for the likes of you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Several guards intercepted Alexander as he approached the cruise ship.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They surrounded him aggressively, ready to act at the slightest wrong word.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smiled amiably, "Thank you for your hard work. Mr. Bryant sent me to express his regards."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The guards were momentarily stunned. They were not ordinary members but Guzman's personal bodyguards.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They thought skeptically, "Could this guy really be sent by Mr. Bryant to console us? Otherwise, how would he know Mr. Bryant is here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they hesitated, Alexander struck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The leading man didn't have time to react before Alexander snapped his neck. His head twisted completely around, his face filled with horror, now facing his back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah! Captain!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Captain!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The guards, their faces pale with fear, drew their guns to shoot at Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sleep now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander slapped their chests swiftly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They fell to the ground, screaming, blood spurting from their mouths.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That single palm strike had not only broken their breastbones and ribs but also sent the ribs piercing through their lungs. They couldn't move now even if they wanted to.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander tossed them all into the sea to feed the fish and then silently infiltrated the cruise ship.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A few minutes later, he stood in front of a door made of reinforced steel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Two guards with blank expressions stood by the door, already under the influence of Alexander's Force Control.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In their eyes, Alexander was as unassailable as their chairman, Guzman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Open the door!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At Alexander's command, one of the guards quickly entered the door's opening password on the control panel and pressed his fingerprint.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thick security door slowly opened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After knocking out the two guards, Alexander slipped in like a cat, silent and stealthy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had managed to avoid the patrolling guards either by his agility or by influencing </span><span>their minds with Force Control, stealthily making his way here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander felt a surge of excitement, sensing he was getting closer to Guzman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The key was not to alert Guzman. If Guzman escaped this time, Alexander wasn't sure he could find him again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beyond the door was a deep corridor, the floor covered in thick, luxurious carpets.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The rooms were beautifully decorated, the walls adorned with exquisite murals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Footsteps approached from ahead. A group of people was coming, about to corner Alexander in the corridor.</span></p><div class="pagination">
