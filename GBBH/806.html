  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Casper Napper shouted orders, "Speed it up! All equipment and ammunition must be unloaded within an hour. Set up the direct-fire cannons first.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"And get the heavy machine guns in place. If it takes longer than an hour, I'll make sure you regret it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Not to be outdone, his short-statured brother Kermit Napper yelled, "Put your backs into it. Finish setting up the defensive positions within an hour, and there's a 500-dollar bonus for each of you. I'll keep my promises."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The brothers urged their men forward with a mix of shouts and promises, but despite their relaxed demeanor, they were filled with worry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, Devil Island lay only a hundred miles from Treasure Island, and they knew it wouldn't be long before Treasure Island noticed their presence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>What they didn't realize was that over a thousand eyes were watching them from within the jungle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>An alarm sounded in the intelligence room of Brillant Group Building.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A man said, "Ms. Bryant, we have an invasion on Devil Island. According to radar, they have a large transport ship and dozens of high-speed boats. No fewer than a thousand personnel are landing."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Treasure Island had a professional intelligence room and radar monitoring system, with satellite maps allowing for round-the-clock surveillance of surrounding islands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, it was no surprise that the Dragon Gang's transport ship was detected shortly after it arrived.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Cloe, however, didn't seem alarmed. She looked calm and confident, having already coordinated with Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>One of her subordinates advised, "Ms. Bryant, we should assemble our forces and strike immediately. If they manage to set up defenses, our ships will be at serious risk of being sunk."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Cloe smirked without saying a word.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The intelligence officers were puzzled by her reaction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Finally, Cloe said slowly, "Keep your eyes on Devil Island. Report any new intelligence immediately."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Got it," the intelligence officers responded in unison.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Devil Island was critically important to Treasure Island; it lay right in the direct shipping lane between the island and the mainland.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Avoiding it would mean taking a massive detour.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Additionally, with their high-speed boats, the Dragon Gang could use Devil Island as a base to intercept and attack passing ships, effectively blockading Treasure Island.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yet Cloe remained unhurried.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She knew Alexander had already infiltrated the island with his team and that he was merely waiting for the perfect moment to strike.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the jungle, Alexander leaned casually against a tree.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With a cigarette dangling from his mouth, he showed no inclination to rush into battle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Boss, aren't we going to strike now?" Marvin asked curiously. "What are we waiting for? Their defenses will be set up soon."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Augusta tugged on Marvin's sleeve. "Shut up. Boss hasn't given the order. It's not your place to question him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marvin fell silent immediately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander gave a faint smile. "No need to hurry. Let them set up the defenses for us. Once they're done, they'll be tired. We'll attack when they're sound asleep."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Turning to Augusta, he added, "Tell everyone to rest. Only a few of us need to keep watch here. Rested soldiers fight better."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Augusta nodded eagerly, passing on the order.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marvin clapped his hands together. "Boss has it all figured out. This is a classic tactic to wait until they're exhausted before striking. Brilliant."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander shot him a withering look. "You've learned how to flatter, haven't you? Looks like Zora taught you well."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marvin gave an embarrassed grin and fell silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander continued to watch the Dragon Gang members intently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Despite the half-mile distance, he could see everything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They were well-trained elites, uniformed and well-armed, equipped with direct-fire cannons and heavy machine guns.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The three leaders seemed to be skilled Risun warriors who had used power elixirs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was already past one in the morning when a cold wind began to rise over the sea. The waves surged, and the temperature plummeted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If Alexander hadn't already set up a protective magic circle, Devil Island would have been battered by the gale.</span></p><div class="pagination">
