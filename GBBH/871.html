Absolutely fantastic!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Keith, you've got a natural talent for this. Trust me, you're on your way to becoming the hottest male star at Dragon Film and Television Company!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Harold clapped Keith on the shoulder, beaming with pride.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Keith said, bowing slightly in appreciation, "Thank you! Thank you so much!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ms. Barnes, you were wonderful as well."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I didn't do much; it was you who worked hard," she replied, returning the gesture.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The group exchanged bows, their professionalism evident in every move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Meanwhile, Alexander sat in a conference room on the top floor of the building, flanked by Norma.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She occupied the main seat, looking sharp and commanding, shedding her usual seductive demeanor for a more authoritative presence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander, sitting beside her, remained unfazed by the dozens of shocked, confused, and angry gazes from the Walsh family executives.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Their stares didn't rattle him; he sat there calmly, smiling as if he were at a casual gathering.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The room was filled with members of the Walsh family, a mix of ages and ranks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Those of higher status occupied the chairs around the table, while others stood nearby, casting furious glances at Alexander and occasionally checking in on Norma.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>An elderly man, frail yet commanding, stood up and pointed an accusatory finger at her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Norma! You better come clean! Did you conspire with this guy to kill the patriarch?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He was in his seventies, his body trembling, but his position in the family was undeniable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Norma frowned, recognizing him as a senior member who often wielded his influence like a weapon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander sprang to his feet, his voice booming with authority. "Listen here, you old coot! Norma isn't just the leader of the Dragon Gang anymore; she's the patriarch of the Walsh family! Who do you think you are to speak to her like that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The old man sneered, his voice dripping with disdain. "Who the hell are you, you little punk? This is a Walsh family meeting! What right do you have to be here?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You're just an outsider, sitting here like you own the place. What are you even doing here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Suddenly, a piercing scream sliced through the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the blink of an eye, Alexander was in front of the old man, his grip like a vise around the elder's throat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The old man's face turned a shade of purple as he gasped for air, stammering, "Help me... someone... Norma... say something..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Norma remained silent, her gaze cold and unyielding as she watched the scene unfold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Let him go!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Release him! Do you want to die?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Chaos erupted in the room as several voices shouted in anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>No one had ever dared to act out like this in a family meeting, especially not a stranger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Go to hell!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A few hot-headed young men, used to getting their way, pulled out guns, aiming them at Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Suddenly, the sound of shattering glass echoed as the young men were hurled out of the window by Alexander, their screams fading into the distance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Fortunately for them, they wouldn't feel any pain; their bodies were reduced to a bloody pulp upon impact.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The moment the glass shattered, they had snapped multiple bones, unable to withstand the force of the fall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before anyone could process what had just happened, several high-ranking members of the Walsh family lay dead on the floor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A frigid wind howled through the open window, sending shivers down the spines of the dozens of family members present, even though it wasn't winter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Beads of cold sweat trickled down their faces, their bodies stiff with dread.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander's piercing gaze swept across the room like twin blades of steel, and wherever it landed, heads dipped in submission, avoiding eye contact.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>These once-mighty higher-ups in the family, now enfeebled by luxury, cowered before Alexander like lambs in the presence of a tiger, too terrified to resist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And then Norma rose, her hands firmly planted on the table, her voice tinged with a mix of excitement and defiance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"By the Walsh family's code, the position of clan leader falls to me. Who among you dares to dispute it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her eyes blazed with fervor that contrasted sharply with the room's chill.</span></p><div class="pagination">
