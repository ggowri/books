  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Felix remain silent and obedient, Barry couldn't help but smile in satisfaction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix really was his lucky star. Thanks to the Red Umbrella Group's resources, Barry had become a Level-3 metahuman, which greatly elevated his status in the Morris family, even making him one of the potential heirs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't get along with the other brothers who were also in line to inherit the family title.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a fierce rivalry, with each of them vying to outmaneuver the others and secure the position of family head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now his chance had come; as long as he could kill Alexander, help the Morris family acquire the formula, and secure a share of the Red Umbrella Group's stock, his brothers would be no match for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hahaha..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barry burst into a triumphant laugh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barry thought Alexander would be no trouble to handle with his level of strength, especially with the full support of the Morris family behind him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Being naturally fond of gambling, beautiful women, and strong drinks, he was immensely drawn to the new casino established by The Kaylon, reputedly the largest and most luxurious in the world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barry commanded, "Diego, get things arranged. We're heading to the Kaylon Casino shortly."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, sir!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diego bowed his head in acknowledgment, then casually gestured for Felix to follow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix's expression soured. Having a mere butler gesture at him like that felt utterly insulting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Felix forced himself to hold back; even with his rage burning inside, he kept silent and obediently followed Diego.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Heh..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A mocking laugh from Barry echoed behind him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sound was like a sharp dagger stabbing into Felix's heart, filling him with a profound sense of humiliation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix gritted his teeth and cursed internally, "Just you wait, Barry. Soon enough, I'll turn you into a life energy elixir. Using a Level-3 metahuman with combat skills as a base should certainly make me a Level-4!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The last time, he'd distilled a clone of Kyle and Raven into nutrient serum, which he then used to create a life energy elixir.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without that, he never would have reached Level-3 metahuman so quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When using a powerful body to make life elixirs, only the first use yields a significant evolution boost.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This meant Felix needed a variety of powerful subjects as ingredients, and Barry was the perfect candidate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix chuckled to himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he could take out both Barry and that old fool Diego, distilling them all into elixirs... just how powerful would he become?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Could he even reach Level-5?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the thought, Felix's previously heavy steps grew considerably lighter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Diego, walking ahead, frowned slightly. He couldn't shake the feeling that Felix was not as simple as he seemed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But then he shook his head. Felix was like a dog with nowhere else to turn, still reliant on the Morris family's support. It was unlikely he'd betray them now. Perhaps he was just getting paranoid in his old age.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Kaylon Casino was the most eye-catching new entertainment complex on </span><span>Kingsdon's</span><span> coastline.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The tallest building there was the Kaylon Hotel, with its penthouse suite.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barry stood by the floor-to-ceiling windows, gazing at the beautiful seascape, speaking to Felix without turning around. "Who'd have thought? Just a few years ago, this was nothing but barren coast, and now The Kaylon's turned it into this thriving hub. They've got some real clout!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix forced a dry laugh, nodding. Although he could hardly stand Barry, he kept his irritation buried deep inside, not showing a hint.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's a state-of-the-art luxury casino. I hear the Patel family from </span><span>Azuran</span><span> even invested in it. They're a big name in global entertainment."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barry was in his element, enthusiastically talking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix kept a smile plastered on his face but inwardly wished he could kill Barry right </span><span>then and there, turning him into a life energy elixir.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had flown here with Barry and his entourage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barry had reserved the top floor of this five-star hotel, with Felix footing the bill.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Morris, I wanted to remind you that Oscar from the </span><span>Loscity</span><span> branch of The Kaylon is on good terms with Alexander. Couldn't Alexander try something against us here at Kaylon Casino?" Felix asked, feigning concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barry laughed with supreme confidence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hahaha! This is the </span><span>Kingsdon</span><span>, not </span><span>Loscity</span><span>. You're overthinking it. The Kaylon isn't going to cross the Morris family just because one branch leader is close to Alexander!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
