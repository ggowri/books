  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander moved with blinding speed, leaving the man no time to dodge. All he could do was let out a furious roar and brace himself, hoping to withstand the blow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But this punch, though only half of Alexander's strength, was devastating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Force surged through Alexander's fist like an unstoppable drill, shattering the man's entire arm and ripping apart half his torso.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Flesh and bone fragments scattered, painting the walls with a gruesome spray.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man in black didn't even have a chance to summon his witchcraft; he was reduced to a mutilated corpse before he could cast a spell.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The onlookers froze, wide-eyed with disbelief. Alexander's two strikes had happened in an instant&mdash;too quickly for anyone to react.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a smug grin, Alexander glanced at the mangled body. "There aren't many left who can survive one punch from me. You took two. That's not bad."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The room fell silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thug with the shaved head took an involuntary step back, his face pale.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Everyone, get him! Kill him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thug gave the order viciously, and everyone launched a fierce attack on </span><span>Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A barrage of gunfire erupted as bullets swarmed toward Alexander like angry hornets.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Watch out!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alyssa gasped, instinctively dropping to the floor and rolling to take cover.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander, however, didn't flinch. Alyssa was behind him, and he had no intention of letting a single bullet reach her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sizzle!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a swift motion, he ignited his Lightsaber, a brilliant beam of light bursting into existence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he slashed it through the air, a radiant shield formed, blocking the entire hallway.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bullets shattered against the light, falling harmlessly to the ground in pieces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To Alexander, thanks to his All-seeing Eyes, even bullets appeared sluggish, hardly faster than snails.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What is this guy? A monster?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thug leader stammered, retreating in terror.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's gaze sharpened. "Trying to run now? You think you can get away?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a single step, Alexander launched himself forward like a shot from a crossbow, closing the gap in a blink.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man closest to him didn't even have a chance to react as Alexander's Lightsaber cut through him and his rifle in one clean stroke.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Woosh!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The corridor echoed with the sharp, explosive sound of the Lightsaber slicing through the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Several gunmen were sliced in half, blood and limbs scattering across the floor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He's a demon! A demon!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One of the men screamed, trying to flee, while others fired at Alexander in a panic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But their bullets were useless, every one deflected by Alexander's impenetrable defense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The more they resisted, the faster they fell, mercilessly cut down into pieces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander tore through them like a tiger in a flock of sheep, leaving devastation in his wake.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Within moments, the hallway had transformed into a nightmarish scene, littered with dismembered bodies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blood coated the floor and walls, making every step slick and treacherous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The bald leader stumbled as he tried to escape, tripping over a severed head and crashing face-first into a pile of remains.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The arrogance he'd shown before was now replaced by sheer terror and desperation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander approached him leisurely, holding his Lightsaber close.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The heat alone scorched the man's eyebrows and singed his hair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Please... don't kill me," he sobbed, tears streaming down his face. "It was the Godfather&mdash;Brandon Hawkins! He forced me into this! I swear it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He broke down completely, pleading, "I have a family&mdash;a wife, kids, and an old mother. Please, have mercy..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's face remained emotionless, untouched by the man's cries. There wasn't an ounce of sympathy in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Somewhere along the line, he had become this unyielding, ruthless force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A living enemy would one day take his revenge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mercy to one's enemy, after all, was the ultimate cruelty to oneself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm sorry," he said quietly, "but I have people to protect, too."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And with that, Alexander swung his Lightsaber.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thug fell silent, frozen as a thin line of blood appeared at his throat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A moment later, his head tumbled to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alyssa stood there, wondering if she was dreaming.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The narrow corridor was strewn with bodies, blood soaking the floor. Within mere minutes, Alexander had wiped out the entire group, leaving nothing but death in his path.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The stench of blood was overwhelming, the evidence all too real that this nightmare was no dream.</span></p><div class="pagination">
