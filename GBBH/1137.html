  <div class="container"><p style="text-align:left;">The fuel tank was punctured, and the air immediately filled with the sharp stench of gasoline.</p><p style="text-align:left;">One stone skimmed the ground, sparks flying as it scraped against the asphalt.</p><p style="text-align:left;">In an instant, the gasoline caught fire, erupting in a massive explosion.</p><p style="text-align:left;">The blast hurled two of the cars through the air, turning them into blazing fireballs.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Some of the wounded, still alive, were engulfed in flames and writhed helplessly on the ground.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Others fired wildly in Alexander&#x27;s direction, but their shots went wide, doing no damage.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Unhurried, Alexander strode toward the wreckage.</p><p style="text-align:left;">As he passed the survivors, he casually flicked stones at them. One by one, Tyler&#x27;s men collapsed, their bodies crumpling in pools of blood.</p><p style="text-align:left;">The last survivor&#x27;s head exploded under the impact of a stone.</p><p style="text-align:left;">The road was littered with corpses, blood flowing like a quiet stream toward the roadside.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Alexander sighed. It was a mercy to end their suffering now rather than let them burn alive.</p><p style="text-align:left;">He turned his gaze to Tyler, shaking his head in disdain.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Slowly, he began walking toward him, each step deliberate and calm, the stillness of his approach making Tyler tremble in fear.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;You bastard! You&#x27;re a devil! You&#x27;ll burn in hell!&quot; Tyler&#x27;s face was as pale as a sheet, his teeth gritted as he cursed.</p><p style="text-align:left;">He tried to escape, but his lower body was pinned under the wreckage. Even with his second-tier fire abilities, he was stuck.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Desperate, Tyler reached for his gun, the only option left to him. His hand was trembling as he aimed at Alexander and fired.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Two shots rang out, and the bullets, enhanced with fiery power, sped toward their target with deadly force.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Tyler believed that even if he didn&#x27;t kill Alexander, the man would at least be forced to retreat, dazed.</p><p style="text-align:left;">But the moment the gunfire rang out, Alexander seemed to vanish.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Tyler&#x27;s eyes darted frantically around, searching for any sign of him. Alexander had disappeared without a trace.</p><p style="text-align:left;">The bullets hit a nearby tree with explosive force, blowing it in half.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Then, a shadow flickered, moving so swiftly that Tyler&#x27;s mind couldn&#x27;t keep up. It felt as though dozens of Alexanders were closing in from every direction.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Tyler fired until the clip was empty, but still, he couldn&#x27;t see where Alexander was. His hands fumbled to reload, panic setting in.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Suddenly, a sharp pain shot through his wrist. Looking up, he found Alexander standing right before him, gripping his wrist with terrifying strength.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Tyler screamed as his arm was twisted at an unnatural angle, rendering it useless.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;How... How did you find us?&quot; Tyler stuttered, his voice filled with both terror and fury.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Under the glow of the flames, Alexander&#x27;s face remained cold, a contemptuous smile on his lips. &quot;Yinson sent you, didn&#x27;t he?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Alexander tore open Tyler&#x27;s shirt, revealing Sakra Society&#x27;s emblem tattooed over his left chest.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Tyler clenched his teeth, refusing to speak.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Playing dumb?&quot; Alexander sneered and twisted Tyler&#x27;s arm again, making him cry out in pain.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;No! Please, don&#x27;t kill me! Yinson sent me! I had no other choice... Please! I&#x27;ll tell you everything!&quot; With death staring him in the face, Tyler&#x27;s defiance crumbled. Fear overtook him, and he began pleading for his life.</p><p style="text-align:left;">The more a man has enjoyed power and luxury, the harder it is for him to face the reality of his death.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Alexander scoffed and picked up the gun from the ground, pressing the barrel against Tyler&#x27;s forehead.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Tell me about your partners, and maybe I&#x27;ll let you live. If you lie to me, I&#x27;ll put a bullet through your skull.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Tyler&#x27;s resolve crumbled under the threat. His words tumbled out in a panicked rush. &quot;There&#x27;s nothing left in Loscity... but in other cities... there are people using enhancement drugs to control key figures... That&#x27;s all I know... Please, just don&#x27;t kill me...&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Alexander&#x27;s eyes narrowed dangerously. He hadn&#x27;t expected Yinson to be so sneaky, spreading his influence in other cities.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Loscity was Ultimate Alliance&#x27;s stronghold. They&#x27;d thwarted Yinson&#x27;s plans here, but in other cities, the situation was far more complicated.</p><div class="pagination">
