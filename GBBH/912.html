  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sheer power of the force was terrifying. It could not only change a person's size in seconds but even alter their appearance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was the stuff of legends, beyond anything anyone had ever seen or heard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander slipped through the grating with ease, entering the ventilation shaft.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Using his hands and feet to brace himself, he descended the steep walls with the agility of a giant gecko, moving swiftly and silently downward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The further he went, the more shocked he became. Dozens of feet underground, and yet the shaft still seemed bottomless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The walls were riddled with branching pipes leading to other levels, but Alexander didn't stop.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was certain that the base's most vital research facility was buried at the very bottom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He continued his descent without hesitation. When he passed three hundred feet, the shaft still stretched endlessly below him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This base was so large it had hollowed out the mountain itself. The scale of the construction was almost incomprehensible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, after descending another few dozen feet, Alexander reached the base of the ventilation shaft.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the bottom was a single narrow conduit. Keeping his movements precise and noiseless, Alexander slipped into it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he crawled through the passage, his mind quickly calculated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had passed at least forty branching pipes on his way down, meaning this underground facility had a minimum of forty levels, reaching depths close to six hundred feet. It was more than a base. It was an underground fortress.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A cold smirk </span><span>curled Alexander's lips</span><span>. Once he rescued Hazel, he'd make sure this entire place was reduced to rubble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And if Sakra Society's leaders and their living dead experiments were here, all the better. He'd take them all out in one blow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moving with practiced ease, Alexander advanced, his x-ray vision scanning the surrounding walls and passages. Everything seemed normal so far.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He reached a vent cover, opened it silently, and dropped into a corridor. Without missing a beat, he straightened his posture and began walking confidently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The lower levels were undoubtedly under heavy security. However, reaching this depth without detection meant no one would suspect him now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As expected, Alexander encountered several uniformed staff along the way. They exchanged brief glances, but no one stopped him. They simply moved on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The walls were lined with doors, many of which were marked with faded codes and numbers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The design suggested the base had been here for decades, likely a remnant of World War II. Sakra Society must have revamped it, transforming it into what they now called Base One.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eventually, Alexander stopped in front of a steel door guarded by two heavily armed </span><span>sentries. Whatever lay beyond this door had to be of critical importance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"ID," one of the guards demanded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander didn't bother answering. Before they could react, he struck both guards down in a blur of motion, leaving them unconscious on the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dragging their bodies into a shadowed corner, he stripped one of the guards of his uniform and slipped it on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now disguised, Alexander moved with even greater confidence. He pushed open the steel door and stepped through.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The corridor on the other side was wider and far more modern. The sleek design was proof of recent renovations by Sakra Society.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The guards here were different too, taller, more muscular, their presence radiating danger. These were elite fighters, not just regular sentries.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet no one questioned Alexander. This was the deepest level of the base, accessible only after multiple layers of identity verification, like passwords, fingerprints, and retinal scans.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The idea of someone infiltrating this far was unthinkable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calm and composed, Alexander strolled down the corridor, his x-ray vision scanning the rooms as he went.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't long before he discovered a massive hall spanning over a thousand square meters. The room was packed with strange machinery and rows of glass cylinders.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These cylinders were filled with a green liquid and contained unsettling contents, human organs, mutated specimens, and other grotesque forms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the center of the hall were several coffin-like glass tanks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each tank was hooked up to numerous monitors and instruments, and within the green liquid lay human bodies, perfectly preserved, lifelike, and horrifyingly intact.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's expression darkened. These weren't ordinary experiments. They were living dead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Near one of the tanks, a group of scientists in white hazmat suits had gathered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were huddled around a woman who was speaking animatedly, her voice commanding their full attention.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander recognized her immediately. It was Elaine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Back in </span><span>Loscity</span><span>, during the plague outbreak, she had posed as an expert from </span><span>Risun</span><span>, publicly ridiculing Alexander and trying to seize his resources.</span></p><div class="pagination">
