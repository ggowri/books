  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The center of Treasure Island was a large square with smooth bluestone slabs on the ground. The ground was slightly white due to the salty and humid sea breeze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The square was surrounded by a large number of exquisite buildings, including some of the tallest buildings on the island.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was obvious that this was a privileged area on the island. Not only was it prosperous and exquisite, but it was also managed and cleaned by dedicated people. There was not a piece of paper on the ground, and there was even a group of birds leisurely strolling and foraging in the square.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This scene was completely different from the previous slums.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This place was like a tourist destination, with beautiful sea views, tranquility, and comfort, which made people yearn for it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, the people Alexander met all looked like gentlemen on the surface. They were either wearing a well-ironed suit or casual clothes and were very polite.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Alexander knew that these people were all demons. The trading center was an important industry of the Brilliant Group and a hub of the international black market.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Here, whether it was arms, women, various contraband, or hiring a killer, as long as you had money, you could buy whatever you wanted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the drug business, which was once the hottest, was now in a slump. With the promotion of magic powder, fewer and fewer people were willing to use drugs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Therefore, this trading center had become an important source of income for the Brilliant Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was said that the daily transaction fees here could bring in tens of millions or even hundreds of millions of dollars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander had not yet confirmed Guzman's exact location, so he would go into the trading center to check it out as soon as possible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sir, do you want to go in and trade? Admission starts at ten thousand dollars."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A pretty waitress stopped Alexander and looked at him with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was stunned for a moment. He didn't expect that the entrance fee would be ten thousand dollars. It was equal to a robbery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When the beauty saw Alexander, she was stunned for a moment but did not show any displeasure and continued to smile, making people feel comfortable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This kind of service didn't make him feel like he was on a sin island, but rather in a high-end club.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander took out his card and paid for the ticket, and the beauty became even more enthusiastic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She could tell from Alexander's expression that he was rich, but this was also his first time at Treasure Island.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was well-informed and well-mannered, and she knew that she might have met a rich person this time and might even get a generous tip.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So</span><span> she provided more considerate service to Alexander and introduced the business of the trading center very patiently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sir, my name is Lynne. In addition to weapons, medicines, and various contraband items, the center also provides other services, such as killers or women..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She approached Alexander shyly and rubbed her plump breasts against his arm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander felt the wonderful soft and elastic touch, but he just smiled indifferently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Any woman around him was better than this salesperson, so of course he was very calm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lynne couldn't help feeling regretful. It seemed that she was going to miss out on this good deal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Otherwise, considering Alexander's youth and handsome appearance, she wouldn't mind pleasing him for free.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, Lynne was even more certain that Alexander must be a big shot who has met numerous women, otherwise, with her looks, no normal man would not be tempted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you have any meteorites here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander asked casually.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lynne was stunned for a moment, then nodded affirmatively.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sir, do you like scientific research? We have thousands of kilograms of meteorites here, but they are very valuable..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before she finished speaking, Alexander became excited and immediately waved his hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll buy all the meteorites!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lynne looked excited.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sir, thousands of kilograms of meteorites would cost over 100 million dollars to buy them all. Do you need so much?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander showed his bank card and said, "I'll pay with my card!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lynne took the card with trembling hands. The commission from this big deal was enough to increase her savings significantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As long as she saved enough money, she could leave Treasure Island and live in a normal place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After the payment, Lynne looked at the signature and found out that his name was </span><span>Edison.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne, your rank in our trading center has been promoted from level one to the top level nine."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We have some great things that are not open to the public. Are you interested?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lynne asked expectantly.</span></p><div class="pagination">
