  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You all should go away, and I want to be alone for a while."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander waved his hand, and everyone immediately left obediently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The ward fell silent. He felt as if his heart was being cut by a knife as he looked at his unconscious daughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ashley, it's me who failed to protect you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ashley! Where is Ashley?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A shrill scream </span><span>interrupted Alexander's thoughts</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, he opened the door and saw that Jane and Belinda were there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane rushed to the bedside without caring about anything, holding Ashley's hand and crying, "Ashley! What's wrong with you? You must be fine, or else how will I survive!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Belinda also howled loudly, "Ashley, you must hold on."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander sneered, "Good acting. Keep going."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane and Belinda froze and could no longer howl.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, you are fully responsible for the condition of Ashley. I'm her mother, and I will file a lawsuit against you and demand compensation of 500 million dollars. No, one billion dollars!" Jane threatened Alexander aggressively.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Belinda agreed, "Yes, it must be one billion dollars. Ashley is our little angel, but you have harmed her like this. If you don't pay, we will sue you and take back the custody."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was so speechless at them, who were shameless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You want to sue me, right? Fine, go ahead and sue me. I'll wait. Don't disturb Ashley's rest here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finished speaking, he grabbed Jane with his left hand and Belinda with his right hand and dragged them out of the ward like dogs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander threw them to the ground like garbage, and they cried out in pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane still refused to accept it, pointing at his nose and scolding, "How dare you mention Ashley? Open your eyes and see what you have done to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The current situation has proven that you are not suitable to raise Ashley. If you don't compensate me, I will sue you and take back the custody."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander looked at her with an indifferent expression. "Go away! You will never get custody in this life."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane was so angry that she jumped up and down and wanted to continue cursing, but she was picked up by Betty's men and dragged out mercilessly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander ordered seriously, "Marvin, Logan, from now on, the two of you should take turns guarding here. No one is allowed to approach without my order.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No matter who it is, anyone who trespasses will be killed without mercy!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marvin and Logan bowed in unison.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander looked at Betty and said, "Gather the latest intelligence about the Red </span><span>Umbrella Group and give it to me within half an hour."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, Boss!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Betty also bent down deeply.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this time, Alice hurried over, twisting her hips, and whispered in Alexander's ear, "Mr. Hawthorne, I have something important to report."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander waved his hand and said, "Let's talk in the car."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>An hour ago, in the suburbs of </span><span>Kingsdon</span><span>, there was a remote manor, and the pungent smell of blood and the broken limbs scattered all over the ground, making it seem like hell on earth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was a secret research base of the Red Umbrella Group. Dave, the leader of genetic weapons research, led more than 30 scientists from the Red Umbrella Group to conduct genetic modification research here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The genetic modification involved the success or failure of the research on power elixir, so this secret base was one of the core bases of the Red Umbrella Group and had strong defense capabilities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The top leaders of the defense force were eight metahuman, each with their own special abilities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The first among the eight metahumans was Aaron Phillips, who once killed dozens of terrorists alone in </span><span>Tanaxes</span><span> and escaped unscathed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His special ability was to control flying knives, which was extremely powerful and mysterious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, tonight, this secret base turned into a bloody hell!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Members of the Red Umbrella Group died one by one, with their body parts scattered all over the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Infinite fear could be seen in their gray eyes that were still open.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before they died, they were so frightened that their already stiff faces became distorted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, in the deepest monitoring room of the base, there were still eight strong men covered in blood, led by their leader, Aaron.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aaron and other metahuman had completely lost their former majesty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their faces were as pale as paper, and they stared at the man in the dark cloak in front of them with shock and anger.</span></p><div class="pagination">
