There's no way I'm letting my future mother-in-law get conned."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava nodded, leaning against Alexander's chest, listening to the steady rhythm of his heartbeat, feeling safe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander suddenly scooped her up, striding towards the bedroom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah, no, not again! You just did it yesterday... what if Mom hears us?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava was blushing like crazy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander chuckled darkly, "Then you'll just have to keep it down, won't you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Honestly, ever since he'd met Lynn, Alexander had felt a strange, restless heat burning inside him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maybe it was Lynn's sultry, mature charm, or perhaps it was a side effect from absorbing the Force through intimacy with so many beauties over time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Alexander kept himself in check&mdash;he wasn't about to let himself fall to the Corrupted Warrior.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the bedroom, Ava knelt down proactively, undoing his pants.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The beast barely restrained inside sprang out, eager and hungry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander caressed her hair with one hand while using his phone with the other, sending Victor's photo to Timothy so he could dig up some dirt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, Ava's tongue movements became more intense, her speed picking up, coupled with soft, enticing hums.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, someone's getting impatient, huh?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander teased, noticing Ava's flushed face and the fact that her skirt and panties had already been pushed down to her knees.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He settled onto the couch and guided Ava to straddle his lap.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wow, someone's soaked already."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, whose fault is that, huh?

Are they for real?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lynn was blushing, and she almost turned away, but her curiosity got the better of her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She tiptoed closer and peeked through the gap, catching sight of the couple&mdash;naked and wrapped in each other on the couch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She intended to look away immediately, but her feet felt glued to the floor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava was on all fours on the couch, gripping the backrest while arching her round, pale buttocks high.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her face was a mix of agony and ecstasy, radiating an intoxicating blend of allure and raw desire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah... I can't take it, seriously, I can't... just go find another woman already!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing her daughter's desperate plea and seeing Alexander in all his unrestrained prowess, Lynn's whole body started to tingle, unable to keep from trembling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is it really that good, sweetheart? Damn, Alexander's really something, lasting this long..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lynn's immediate thought was that none of the men she'd been with could even come close&mdash;they were all leagues behind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava finally surrendered, collapsing onto the couch, her body a limp mess, her mind drifting in and out of consciousness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, Lynn realized what she was doing&mdash;her hand was inside her nightgown.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What am I doing?! That's my daughter and her fianc&eacute;&mdash;stop it, stop right now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite the inner reprimand, her hand refused to obey, only working faster instead.</span></p><div class="pagination">
