  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kirk Harris' face turned a deep shade of red, clearly embarrassed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Blackburn, times are tough for me right now. I have to make every opportunity count. Please give the gemstone back, and I'll make some sort of compensation to Alexander."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Compensation?" Alexander scoffed, not even pretending to give the gemstone back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harris stiffened, barking out, "Security! Get in here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Harris, what do you need?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A few burly security guards rushed in, looking aggressive as they surrounded Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander didn't even flinch; he just gave a smirk.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Harris, maybe you should be more worried about your health. Trouble's coming your way, and your life might be on the line."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't try to scare me, Alexander! Treasures belong to those who deserve them. The gemstone is mine, and it's up to me if I want to sell it or not."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feeling the backup behind him, Harris puffed up, growing bolder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Step aside." Alexander waved his hand casually.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, the guards were thrown back as if hit by a truck, crashing hard to the floor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander simply dusted off his hands, as though swatting at some flies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Harris, you're about to have a heart attack. Get to a hospital if you want to live. If it wasn't for this gemstone, I wouldn't have bothered to warn you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And if you keep pushing me, you won't like what happens next."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A chilling aura radiated from Alexander, dropping the temperature around them significantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"W-what are you trying to do? There are cameras here..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harris felt like he had just been plunged into freezing water, his body trembling uncontrollably as he struggled to speak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander ignored him, taking Ava's hand and turning to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lynn shot Harris a scathing look before quickly following Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harris' face twisted in anger, but he didn't dare make another move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ridiculous! Since when do I have heart problems? He's just trying to curse me! Stealing my gemstone and cursing me&mdash;unbelievable."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You'll regret this! Just wait!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He pulled out his phone, ready to call for backup, completely dismissing Alexander's warning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ahh!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, a sharp pain seized his chest. Moments later, his entire left side went numb, and he felt paralyzed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clutching his chest, Alexander's words echoed in his head. He tried to call for help, but no sound came out&mdash;it was too late for regrets.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Harris, what are your orders?" a voice asked, sounding concerned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Help... my heart..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Harris collapsed heavily onto the floor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Outside Dragonstone Gem Company, Lynn kept apologizing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alex, I'm really sorry. I had no idea Kirk was like that. I guess you never really know people."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander gave her an easy smile. "It's alright. I already called an ambulance for him. Consider it even for the gemstone."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lynn eyed Alexander curiously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alex, how exactly did you know this was a high-quality gemstone?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Maybe just luck..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander gave a mysterious smile, offering no further explanation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lynn rolled her eyes playfully. At that moment, she looked stunning&mdash;even Alexander, who had seen plenty of beautiful women, felt his heart skip a beat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't help but think Ava was right&mdash;her mother really did have a charm that was hard to resist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feeling guilty about what had happened, Lynn insisted on helping Alexander search the market for more gems.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, aside from the ruby Alexander had found, their efforts turned up nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alex, there's nothing more we can do now. We'll have to wait for the auction&mdash;there'll definitely be some amazing pieces up for grabs." Lynn sighed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you for your help, Ms. Blackburn. I really appreciate it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander meant it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's getting late. Why don't we grab some food? Oh, and I can introduce you both to my fianc&eacute;."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lynn blushed slightly as she spoke.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava's eyes widened in surprise. The last of her worries vanished&mdash;knowing her mom had found a stable partner was comforting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The three of them headed to a restaurant in </span><span>Loscity</span><span>, where a distinguished middle-aged man was already waiting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wore a well-tailored suit, standing tall and proud. With his confident air and polished appearance, it was no wonder Lynn had fallen for him.</span></p><div class="pagination">
