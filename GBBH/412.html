  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane suddenly came out to stop Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, just forgive them. Are you going to kill for Ava?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was used to talking to Alexander arrogantly, and she still looked condescending.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shut up!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander turned to glare at Jane, his cold eyes were like a knife.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane was furious and still felt that everything was Alexander's fault.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought that if Ashley participated in the research program, everything would be fine. Could the Red Umbrella Group still kill people?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane was being nice and concerned about Alexander, but he yelled at her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane rushed over and grabbed Alexander's clothes, viciously saying, "Alexander, do you know what you're doing? Don't think that bitch can protect you. The Red Umbrella Group's power is not comparable to yours."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll tell you one last time, don't think you're the best in the world if you can fight. Sooner or later, you'll get what's coming to you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane used to like to grab Alexander's clothes like this to teach him a lesson, but she had completely forgotten that it wasn't the old days anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>So</span><span> you've defected to the Red Umbrella Group now, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander flung his arm away in disdain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A huge force erupted, and he pushed Jane to the ground again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, Simon secretly took out his cell phone and called for help.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander sneers, "Did I tell you to call?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He kicked over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a bang, Simon's cell phone flew out and fell apart. Besides, Simon's hand </span><span>swelled up like a balloon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wailed continuously as he clutched his hands in pain, but he didn't dare to scream out loud yet for fear that Alexander would hit him again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Asshole, the Red Umbrella Group is not easy to bully..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Simon glared at Alexander with spite in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sound of chaotic footsteps rang out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marvin and Logan rushed into the building with hundreds of people, and they saw Ava, who was holding Ashley, at once.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Blackburn, are you alright?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Logan asked respectfully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava said in a hurry, "I'm fine. Go help Alexander."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My dad is awesome, and he beats the bad guys down in one go. They're all bad guys!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ashley complained loudly, waving her cute little fists.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Logan and the others laughed as they came as soon as they got the message from Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They didn't even believe Alexander needed help in a fight, he definitely wanted to kill everyone here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Go upstairs!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Logan gave the order as those men rushed up the stairs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daniel was overjoyed to see so many people.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Simon, isn't that someone from the Red Umbrella Group?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Simon was stunned as if he didn't recognize the people who had come.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Logan was also suddenly stunned, and he stared at Simon in utter amazement as he began to reminisce.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Simon was also dazed for a few moments at the sight of Logan. Then, he jumped up in surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you Logan? I'm Simon, it's me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Logan rushed up and hugged Simon, and they hugged each other tightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Simon had tears in his eyes. "Logan, we haven't seen each other in over twenty years, have we? I remember that time when you went to the army, when you were just eighteen years old."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Logan suddenly turned to Alexander with a serious look.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander didn't expect Logan and Simon to be close, and he didn't stop them from recognizing each other.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Logan, you have to help me today!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Simon kept complaining.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next second, Logan's reaction was out of everyone's expectation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He held Simon with a very solemn expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Simon, it's been more than thirty years since we met, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Simon was touched as he held Logan's shoulders and kept nodding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Jane grunted coldly, "Alexander, you didn't listen when I asked you to stop just now. Wait for the shit to hit the fan!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Logan responded to Simon quite excitedly, "Yeah. Simon, I was only six when I met </span><span>you. At that time, we were still in elementary school, and we've both gotten older in the blink of an eye."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, we are still good friends!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Simon, with hidden tears in his eyes, patted Logan's shoulder forcefully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Simon, I will take good care of your wife and child. Don't worry. I'll let your kid go to school and be a good person, and he won't be like you in the future."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Simon was taken aback by Logan's words of concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What did he mean?</span></p><div class="pagination">
