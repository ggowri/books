  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The atmosphere was thick with tension as Emma nervously glanced between Alexander and the check lying temptingly on the floor.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Thirty million dollars!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">That was a sum most people could only dream of making in a lifetime.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Like Rebecca, Emma was convinced Alexander wouldn't pass up this golden opportunity.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After all, with that kind of money, he could have his pick of beautiful women&mdash;or even juggle a few at once.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Sure enough, Alexander bent down and picked up the check, much to Rebecca's delight.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her disdainful smile spread wider. Rebecca was convinced that she had finally broken him under the allure of wealth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Emma's eyes narrowed with contempt as she watched Alexander, her expression dripping with scorn.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But then, the surprise came.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Rebecca's smug grin faltered as she watched Alexander tear the check into pieces, flinging them out the window.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The pieces fluttered away like confetti, startling the fly perched on the glass, which immediately darted off into the air.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander's voice was calm as he addressed Rebecca.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Did you see that fly just now? It flew away."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What do you mean?" Rebecca frowned, confusion etched on her face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With piercing clarity, Alexander locked eyes with her. "You look down on it because it's just a fly, but it can soar. Can you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Rebecca was momentarily speechless.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He continued, his tone gaining strength, "You only see it as a fly, but it can fly higher than any of us.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It has seen skies you've never glimpsed, weathered storms you've never faced.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"There are countless flies in this world, living their own lives, just like us common folk.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I bet when the Hansen family first arrived in Loscity two centuries ago, they might have been seen as less than a fly by those big shots.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Even now, I see the Hansen family as just a slightly stronger fly."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Rebecca's face turned crimson with rage.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Shut your mouth! Who do you think you are to judge the Hansen family?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ignoring her fury, Alexander seemed to be lost in thought.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You, as part of the Hansen family, aren't superior; you're just standing on the hard work of your ancestors. What's there to be proud of?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"To me, you and Orion are just flies."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander looked at Rebecca with an expression full of pride.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You compare us to flies? You must be out of your mind!" Rebecca shot back, her voice rising.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She didn't want to argue with him any longer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In her mind, Alexander had a way with words that twisted and turned, making it hard for her to counter him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Even if you make valid points, you have no right to be involved in negotiations between the Hansen family and the Saint Group. That's the gap in our statuses&mdash;a chasm that can't be crossed."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With that, she strutted into the office, leaving Emma at the door, her posture defensive, like a guard protecting treasure.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander didn't bother to argue. Instead, he walked around the corner and called Anne.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Before long, Ava and the two from the Hansen family emerged from the office, their expressions a mix of confusion and frustration.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava held her phone, indignation spilling over.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Ms. Hollister, what's going on? Why did the chairman refuse to let me negotiate with the Hansen family? What's the reasoning behind it?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Anne explained the situation, and Ava's eyes widened. "What? You want me to wait until tomorrow's meeting? What does that even mean?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Before she could process it further, Anne hung up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A sly smile crept onto Alexander's face. He had instructed Anne to relay the chairman's orders. no negotiations with the Hansen family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tomorrow, the Saint Group will undoubtedly become the exclusive distributor of magic powder. Forget the Hansen family; everyone would be begging to partner with the Saint Group.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Orion glared at Alexander; his fist raised threateningly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What's so funny, Alexander? You better remember our wager. If you back out, I'll make you wish you hadn't."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With that, he and Rebecca left, their expressions cold, not even bothering to acknowledge Ava.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Rejection from the chairman of the Saint Group stung deeply, leaving Ava feeling humiliated.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Feeling wronged, she retreated into her office, ignoring Alexander completely.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Word spread quickly about Ava's decision to break things off with Alexander, and soon, the news reached every corner of the Saint Group.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The story quickly spread like wildfire, eventually landing on the front page of an online news outlet.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">[Saint Group President Ditches Scandal-Ridden Boyfriend!]</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">[Mr. Hansen Emerges Victorious, Winning the Heart of the Female CEO!]</p><div class="pagination">
