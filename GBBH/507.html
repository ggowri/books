  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was unclear how much time had passed. The place was a mess, and Danielle lay unconscious on the floor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix, shirtless, sat on the couch with one leg crossed over the other.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Click!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His secretary lit a cigarette for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Puff..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix took a relaxed drag, his eyes narrowing with a look of pleasure and satisfaction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Danielle had certainly been satisfying; it had been a long time since he'd felt this good.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unbidden, his mind drifted to Alexander and the bounty, and his anger ignited.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn you, the minute you set foot in </span><span>Kingsdon</span><span>, you're dead!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His mood soured instantly as he muttered curses against Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix crushed his cigarette furiously and barked out, "Did you get in touch with Mr. Wallace? Hasn't he deployed any troops yet? He's the commander of </span><span>Kingsdon</span><span> Combat Zone, doesn't he care if the Red Umbrella Group lives or dies?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feeling Felix's intense fury, the secretary trembled in fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Rest assured, sir, we... we've reached him. I'm sure Mr. Wallace will... he'll respond soon," the secretary stammered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix clenched his teeth, pondering for a moment before snapping, "And that idiot Barry hasn't replied either. Alexander killed his son </span><span>Raven,</span><span> does he not want revenge?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>So</span><span> this is what it's come to... even that Barry dares act superior to me... just wait and see!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix slammed his hand onto the coffee table.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Crack!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sturdy glass coffee table shattered, scattering shards across the floor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The secretary, pale with fright, stepped back several times, bowing his head low.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Francis Wallace, a four-star general, lounged comfortably in his large, plush chair, leaning back with an expression of deep satisfaction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A blonde, blue-eyed beauty knelt before him, focused intently on pleasing him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That little bastard Felix is desperate now. That billion-dollar bounty on the Dark Web is no joke, and the Godfather himself is coming for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Quentin and </span><span>Theodore</span><span> both warned me to stay out of it. Unless Felix coughs up a serious price, I'm not lifting a finger to help," he chuckled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Francis grinned, enjoying himself so much that his eyebrows relaxed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Mmm</span><span>..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The blonde couldn't respond, her mouth otherwise occupied, so she cast him a seductive gaze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Knock, knock, knock!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was a knock on the door, and Francis frowned slightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The blonde picked up her pace, her head moving up and down quickly. Francis' body tensed, clearly nearing the peak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Knock, knock, knock..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The persistent knocking only intensified Francis' excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He grabbed the blonde's soft chest tightly, his body trembling uncontrollably as his tense brows finally relaxed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The tension left his body, replaced by satisfaction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The seductive blonde slowly stood up, having given it her all. Those last few moments had almost made her gag.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Francis gave her a squeeze and chuckled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Juliet, your skills are sharper than ever. It's worthy of a colonel."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Today, Juliet was wearing a black miniskirt and a white embroidered blouse that barely contained her ample chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her figure was so curvy, and the blouse so tight, that she was even more eye-catching.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Wallace, you're the one who's gotten even stronger. My mouth's all sore and numb," Juliet purred.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She adjusted her clothes, wiped the remnants from her mouth with a damp tissue, and, swaying her slim waist, strutted over in her diamond-studded heels to answer the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Flinging the door open, Juliet snapped, "What's with the knocking? Can't you see we are discussing something important?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, yes, sorry, Ms. Willis. My apologies..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Juliet, the middle-aged man who had rushed over instantly lowered his head, shrinking back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone in Command knew she was Francis' mistress, so they could easily guess what was going on in his office.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Juliet's face was flushed, her eyes full of passion. Anyone with experience knew exactly what had happened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Speak. What's the matter?" Francis asked, his expression stern.</span></p><div class="pagination">
