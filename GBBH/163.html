  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A wave of sympathy washed over Alexander as he thought about his own past, the faces of his parents fading into a blur.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hold on, let me take a look," Alexander said, moving toward the bed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He concentrated, channeling the Force to assess the elderly woman's condition.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There's still some bleeding in the brainstem, which is putting pressure on the nerves. With current medical technology, they can't stop the bleeding. You're lucky you came to me when you did; otherwise, it could have been life-threatening."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mary was taken aback, her heart racing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had only come to Alexander under the pretense of seeking treatment for her mother, primarily to test his capabilities and see if there was any chance to get her hands on the magic powder formula.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mary hadn't expected him to diagnose her mother's condition so accurately and with such confidence that he could fix it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne, you... you can really help my mom?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her anticipation was palpable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander nodded with a calm assurance in his demeanor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can stop the bleeding in the brainstem, but whether she wakes up depends on her own strength."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A rush of hope surged through Mary, and she grasped Alexander's hand, her eyes pleading.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Please, Mr. Hawthorne, whatever it takes to save her, I'll pay any amount!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He pondered for a moment, then replied, "Some things don't need to be spelled out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We both know we can work together on this."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He smiled gently, patting her hand in a way that made her cheeks flush.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mary instinctively pulled her hand back, feeling a jolt of realization.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This guy isn't as innocent as he seems; he's definitely got his eyes on my body," she thought, misinterpreting his intentions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He placed his hand on the elderly woman's forehead, channeling the Force to massage the affected area.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Force enveloped the site of the bleeding, gradually breaking down the clotted blood and promoting the healing of the capillaries.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This delicate procedure, while it appeared simple, was beyond the reach of contemporary medical practices.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was why brainstem hemorrhages were deemed a significant medical challenge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Alexander worked, the blood clot pressing on the nerves began to dissolve like an iceberg melting away in the sun.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mary watched intently, captivated by the unique aura Alexander exuded&mdash;a blend of mystery and nobility that made her heart race.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After half an hour of concentrated effort, Alexander finally withdrew his hand, beads of sweat forming on his forehead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had nearly exhausted his available Force and would need to meditate to replenish it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"All done, but your mom's nerves have been under pressure for a while. She'll need some time to rest and recover fully," he said, his voice steady.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mary was filled with a mix of joy and skepticism.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Can just touching her head really heal her?" she wondered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, a portly man in a white lab coat burst into the room, his expression furious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What do you think you're doing? Who gave you permission to touch the patient?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander quickly explained, "The family asked me to help."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ignoring him, the man turned to Mary with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mary, you didn't let me know you were coming. I could have prepared! There's a new steakhouse nearby that's supposed to be fantastic. We should check it out."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mary shot him an annoyed glance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dr. Hank, I told you before, we're not a match. Please stop pursuing me. Mr. Hawthorne is the one I brought in to help my mother wake up."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brad Hank's face darkened immediately, but he didn't dare lash out at Mary.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead, he turned to Alexander and shouted, "Who let you wander into our hospital? Are you a doctor? Do you even have a medical license?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander calmly shook his head. "I'm not a doctor, and I don't have a medical license."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brad scoffed, a mocking grin spreading across his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mary, you've been duped! This guy isn't even a doctor&mdash;he's a fraud!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shut up. I don't need your advice on how to do my own things," Mary retorted, her anger boiling over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brad's disrespect toward Alexander was infuriating, and she couldn't stand it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Brad could say another word, the old woman in the bed suddenly let out a faint grunt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At first, everyone thought they were hearing things, but then the woman grunted again, slowly opening her eyes.</span></p><div class="pagination">
