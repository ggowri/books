  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even the security guards were displeased with Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If they let a liar in, what should they do if something happened to Elaina? The consequences would be very serious!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander gazed at the security guards calmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let me see Orlando. I can cure Elaina."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The leading security captain stepped forward and sneered, "You are a liar. Do you want to see Mr. Gomez? Impossible!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander asked, "Why? Is it because I have never been a doctor?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's right! Liars have no right to meet Mr. Gomez. Is this reason enough?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The security captain shoved Alexander, feeling as if he were pushing a huge rock, and Alexander did not move at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You are quite strong. No wonder you dare to cheat. Get out of here, or I will beat you up!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander ignored them and walked straight into the villa, but the security captain immediately stopped him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you fucking out of your mind? Didn't you hear what I just said?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You liar, do you want to see Mr. Gomez? Dream on! I'll count to three. If you don't get out of here, don't blame me for attacking you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get out of the way!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander stepped forward before they started counting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The security captain's face blushed with anger, and he quickly led his men to surround Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you leaving or not?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The security captain reached out for Alexander's arm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He sneered. As long as he grabbed Alexander by the wrist and twisted it in the opposite direction, Alexander's arm would be injured, and it would take him at least a month to recover.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander stared at him coldly and did not resist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The security captain grasped Alexander's wrist as he wished and suddenly exerted force, but Alexander remained unfazed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The security captain tried his best, but it was of no use.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's arm was like a steel pipe, and the captain couldn't shake it despite his efforts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You! How do you have so much strength?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a panic, the security captain took two steps back tremblingly with a dark face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Another security guard chuckled, "Captain, what are you doing? Are you feeling weak today because you spent too much time at the bar last night? Let me help you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He also reached out for Alexander's arm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get lost!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander waved his hand casually, as if to drive away a mosquito.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two security guards suddenly felt a powerful force strike them, as if they had been hit by a speeding truck, and they flew backwards.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was an uproar at the scene. No one expected Alexander to beat someone in front of the Gomez Villa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The remaining security guards were unable to stop him and were knocked down by him effortlessly. Then, he headed towards the Gomez Villa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop! Who dares to act recklessly at the Gomez Villa?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Following an angry shout, more than a dozen strong men in black rushed out and surrounded Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing the majestic voice, everyone was stunned for a moment and then burst into discussion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Orlando is here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's Mr. Gomez. The guy is in trouble!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Orlando, in his fifties, came out, looking haggard and exhausted, and glared at Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you sure you can cure my daughter?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander replied calmly, "I can give it a try, and the chances of success are very high."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's inexcusable that you have caused such a commotion in my place. If you can't cure my daughter, I will definitely take revenge on you. Can you afford the consequences?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Orlando was fierce.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander beat up the security guards from the Gomez family in public. As the family head, Orlando certainly couldn't forgive him easily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those black-clad men behind Orlando all stood up and glared at Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, a chilling, murderous aura spread out, and everyone felt depressed and breathless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Archie wiped the cold sweat and secretly felt glad that he did not act impulsively. Otherwise, he would be in big trouble after failing to cure Elaina.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, he glanced at Alexander, thinking that he was doomed today.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why don't you answer me? Are you scared?" Orlando asked coldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smiled, "If your daughter recovers, I want your dragon bone fragment."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What? You want the dragon bone fragment?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Orlando gazed at Alexander viciously, wishing to kill him.</span></p><div class="pagination">
