  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Cooper..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rowan was instantly dumbfounded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hadn't expected Toby Cooper, the head of </span><span>Loscity</span><span> Wealth Counsel, to personally show up; he was one of the top lawyers in </span><span>Loscity</span><span> and quite formidable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At Toby's level, he usually wouldn't take on ordinary cases, and his fees were extremely high; it was surprising he'd get involved in such a minor case.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Rowan was feeling uneasy, an even more shocking scene unfolded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yeats Porter from </span><span>Loscity</span><span> Court arrived.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Toby quickly greeted him warmly, saying, "Mr. Porter, I appreciate your help with this case; our client, Mr. Alexander, is innocent."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No problem, no problem."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yeats didn't chat with Toby for long; he bypassed him and walked straight to Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne, hello, I'm Oscar's nephew. It's an honor to meet you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yeats extended his hand to Alexander with great respect, shocking all the lawyers present.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A judge can significantly influence a verdict, and judges wield the power of decision, standing high above others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander hadn't realized this judge was from the Porter family, so they chatted happily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Toby's feelings were quite complicated; he initially thought Yeats came because of him, but it turned out it was mainly due to Alexander&mdash;this client was truly extraordinary.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rowan felt a chill in his heart; how could he win this lawsuit now?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane, however, scoffed in defiance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ha, Alexander, don't think you can do anything just because Ava pulled a few strings for you. Mr. Poole is a very well-known barrister, and I will definitely win."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane still confidently asked Rowan, "Mr. Poole, am I wrong?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rowan ignored her, his expression shifting, clearly weighing the pros and cons.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane noticed his silence and asked curiously, "Mr. Poole, what do you mean? Why aren't you saying anything?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Toby burst out laughing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hahaha, since when did Rowan become a barrister? I remember he's not even a full-fledged Advanced lawyer yet, two tiers below a barrister."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yeats also showed a hint of mockery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rowan felt extremely awkward; he wanted to retort but couldn't find the words since Toby's statement was factual.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane finally noticed something was off; the Mr. Poole who had been so confident suddenly seemed like a different person.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rowan sighed and said, "Ms. Fairfax, I didn't expect Toby to intervene in this case and even bring a judge with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, we have no chance of winning this case... I advise you to back off. As for the lawyer fees, I'll return them to you right away..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rowan looked incredibly awkward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Poole, do you even know what you're saying? I have to win this lawsuit!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane was fuming with rage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She knew Alexander had money now, and while she regretted it, she still viewed him through old eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rowan sighed in frustration. "Look at how eager Toby and Mr. Porter are with Alexander; it's clearly flattery. Ms. Fairfax, you've really gotten me into a losing case!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That bastard Alexander is just relying on his magic powder, not a real prestigious family."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane muttered stubbornly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If she hadn't forced Alexander to divorce, what kind of glory would she have enjoyed?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking of this made Jane's heart ache as if it were being cut by a knife.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Fairfax, I advise you to withdraw your lawsuit quickly; otherwise, you'll face our charges. If you're found guilty of defamation, you'll have to pay a hefty sum and could even go to jail."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Madelyn fixed her intense gaze on Jane.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shut up! It's clearly Alexander who scammed our family out of millions. Why should I withdraw the suit? He should apologize and compensate me double, or I won't back down."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane shouted like a furious shrew, beside herself with anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What a ridiculous joke!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yeats said coldly, "Ms. Fairfax, I came here today just to give you a chance to withdraw the lawsuit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If it really goes to court, I guarantee you'll lose. Your defamation charges will stick, and you'll end up in jail&mdash;just ask your Mr. Poole."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane's face went pale.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Poole, what do we do now? Is there really no way out? You're my lawyer; you have to help me..."</span></p><div class="pagination">
