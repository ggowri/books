  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He was no longer the naive and innocent man he once was; he had long seen through Jane's true colors.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Alexander, you bastard, stop right there!" Jane screamed in frustration.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Andrew said, leading the Fairfax family to swarm around Alexander, "Jane, I told you this trash doesn't know what's good for him. Look, he's slapped you in the face again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I've already notified Mr. Sebastian Tate. He'll be here with his men in a few minutes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Alexander, you're not going anywhere today!" Andrew gloated.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Five million dollars and Sebastian's favor, it was a two-for-one deal.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander couldn't help but sneer, saying, "Jane, so this was a trap, something you had planned from the beginning."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jane's face was filled with fury. "Alexander, this is all your fault. You brought it on yourself. I begged you for forgiveness, but you were unmoved."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She looked like she had suffered a great injustice, which made Alexander both angry and amused.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You think this trash can stop me?" Alexander asked disdainfully.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Andrew smiled and said, "Alexander, no matter how powerful you are, can you beat my gun?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He drew his pistol, aiming the dark muzzle at Alexander.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If you dare to run, I'll turn you into a colander!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jane asked again, "Alexander, will you remarry me? If you don't agree, I'll leave you to your own devices."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Andrew was furious. "Jane, are you crazy? Have you been hit with Alexander's witchcraft?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Why do you insist on pleasing him? You hated him before!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But Jane insisted, "Alexander, please forgive me. I was wrong. Let's remarry!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander was speechless. On the one hand, they were ambushing him with the Fairfax family, and on the other, she was demanding forgiveness with such conviction.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He was so sick of looking at Jane that he felt nauseated thinking about the humiliation he had suffered in the Fairfax family, Jane's betrayal, and her forcing him into a divorce.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander just wanted to hurry back and explain to Ava before Rebecca could cause any misunderstandings.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Move if you want to live!" Alexander ignored Andrew's gun and strode forward.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Andrew, who was in the front line, was startled and quickly pressed his gun to Alexander's side, shouting, "Do you want to die?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander sneered and swiped his hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Andrew spun around, and the pistol ended up in Alexander's hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Those who stand in my way, die!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander held Andrew in his left hand and pressed the gun to Andrew's forehead, marching forward.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The Fairfax family members, who had never seen such a scene, were immediately terrified and backed away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jane, stimulated, screamed, "Alexander, you bastard, let go of my dad!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander ignored her and continued forward.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Andrew stuttered, threatening, "Alexander, your arrogance will end soon. When Mr. Sebastian Tate arrives, you're as good as dead..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander smashed the gun's butt into his face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With a scream, Andrew fell to the ground, his face swollen like a mound of earth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Suddenly, the sound of car engines roared, quickly approaching from a distance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Seven or eight black cars sped over and came to a screeching halt.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The door of the black Rolls-Royce in the middle opened, and Sebastian, supported by several men, stumbled out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mr. Sebastian Tate, Alexander is here! I'm Andrew, the one who contacted you. Come and get him!" Andrew exclaimed excitedly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Sebastian saw that it was indeed Alexander and was overjoyed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Quick! Help me over there..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Andrew was still trying to take credit. "Mr. Sebastian Tate, the Fairfax family has gone through a lot to capture Alexander. Look at my face&mdash;he's bruised it badly."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Sebastian ignored Andrew, his mind racing as he struggled with the thought of publicly begging Alexander for mercy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Seeing Sebastian's distressed and almost inhuman expression, Alexander felt a surge of amusement.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was clear Sebastian was buckling under the pressure from the Force and had come here to beg for his life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As Sebastian pondered how to plead with Alexander, Andrew, eager to take credit, began directing the Fairfax family members to aim their guns at Alexander.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Andrew barked, "Alexander, apologize to Mr. Sebastian Tate now, or I'll blow you to pieces!"</p><div class="pagination">
