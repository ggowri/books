  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What! The maintenance fee is this expensive? This is daylight robbery!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nick jumped up angrily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mia shouted angrily, "Why are you charging us so much? Over $300,000 a year? Why don't you just rob us instead?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Charles let out a cold laugh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you playing dumb? The homeowners' association has standard fees. This villa is worth over 40 million dollars. Is this amount really too much?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he argued back, he looked at Alexander with confusion. How could someone who could afford such a mansion care about such a small fee?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Besides the maintenance fee, there are also property taxes, which cost hundreds of thousands annually.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander remained calm, a meaningful smile appearing on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This isn't my concern. The money owed must be paid."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nick kept yelling, "I don't care! This is robbery! I'm definitely not paying this!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm not paying! What can you do about it? This is my house, and I'll live here. What can you do to stop me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing that Alexander remained silent, Charles understood his stance and immediately toughened his tone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Portman, are you trying to stir up trouble? I'm not the one to be trifled with."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mia adopted a shameless, hysterical stance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who's afraid of you? This house is ours, and we make the rules! You're trying to rob us? Get out of my house!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Charles was shaking with anger; he'd never seen such shameless people.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He made a call, and within minutes, seven or eight security guards surrounded Nick and Mia, looking aggressive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What are you doing? This is my house, private property! Who allowed you to come in?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nick tried to rage, but the security guards pinned him down on the table, making him immobile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Not paying, huh? Let's give him a beating first."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Charles ordered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't hit me! No... don't hit me! If you want the maintenance fee, go to Alexander. This is his house; he bought it..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nick, who bullied the weak but feared the strong, immediately backed down in fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Charles picked up the property documents, sneering.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The name on these documents isn't Mr. Hawthorne's. It's Nick and Mia. Why are you trying to pin this on Mr. Hawthorne?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No one has ever dared to default. Break a leg first, then seize the house!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Charles threw the papers at Nick's face, looking as fierce as a man-eating tiger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't hit us! Please, Mom, help us! Say something and get Alexander to help us."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nick and Mia begged desperately for mercy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily felt conflicted; after all, they were her son and his wife.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She couldn't help but plead with Alexander, "Alexander, for my sake, forgive them this once."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander sighed inwardly. Having such a son was indeed unfortunate for his aunt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He grabbed Nick by the collar and lifted him up, coldly asking, "Is this house yours? Do you still want $20,000 a month?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nick shook his head repeatedly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The house isn't ours, and we no longer want the money. I was wrong, Alexander, please forgive us... I beg you..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander scoffed. "If you don't want a beating, then get lost. Don't let me see you again."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nick initially wanted to plead with Lily to let him stay in the villa. When she turned away, he was disappointed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne doesn't want to see you. If you don't leave now, I'll use force."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Charles grinned viciously and waved his hand, and the security guards prepared to act.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nick and Mia fled in panic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Charles then bowed respectfully to Alexander, apologizing, "Mr. Hawthorne, I apologize for my rudeness earlier."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You did well, very satisfying. I'll cover all the fees from now on."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He then instructed Betty to transfer money to Charles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After receiving the payment, Charles became even more courteous. He pulled out a business card from his pocket and handed it over with both hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne, according to our homeowners' association rules, whenever one of our owners encounters trouble, we'll help resolve it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The homeowners' association in this wealthy neighborhood has a strong background and considerable influence.</span></p><div class="pagination">
