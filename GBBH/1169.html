  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Alexander was about to unzip his pants and let his cock out, his phone suddenly buzzed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He checked the screen</span><span>&mdash;</span><span>it was Lynn's number. Talked about speaking of the devil.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander pressed his cock against her wet pussy, grinding slowly as he asked, "Why aren't you back yet?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Heh." A man's sinister laugh came through the speaker.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's face darkened instantly as he pulled his pants back up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosalia, who had been swaying her hips waiting for Alexander to thrust in, froze in confusion. The aching wetness between her thighs grew uncomfortable as she waited for his touch that never came.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, you killed Stephen, didn't you? I've got that bitch Lynn here with me. Let's have a nice chat about it." The cold voice spoke again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stephen?" Alexander thought, a murderous glint flashing in his eyes. "Could these be Sakra Society people again?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His voice turned ice cold. "You're with the Sakra Society? If you touch even a single hair on Lynn's head, I'll send you straight to hell."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words rang out with deadly intent, turning the entire hallway into a frozen wasteland.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosalia jumped up and pulled her pants back on, her expression turning dead serious as she looked at Alexander. Now definitely wasn't the time for fooling around.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The mocking laughter crackled through the phone. "What's with the tough guy act, Alexander? It's not </span><span>gonna</span><span> work on me. I've got Lynn right here, and if you keep running your mouth, I might just start by chopping off one of her hands."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's voice came out low and deadly, each word dripping with barely contained rage. "Touch her, and you're dead."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The phone went silent. Clearly, even </span><span>through</span><span> the call, Alexander's murderous intent had gotten through.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a moment, the laughter started up again, this time with a sneering edge to it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh please, don't act so high and mighty just because you managed to kill Stephen. He might've been called the top fighter, but in the Sakra Society, we've got dozens just like him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, help me!" Lynn's desperate cry suddenly came through the phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shut up!" A harsh voice shouted, followed by the unmistakable sound of someone being struck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's grip on the phone tightened until his knuckles went white, his face twisting with barely suppressed fury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lynn was Ava's mother and one of his closest confidants</span><span>&mdash;</span><span>an absolute red line that no one was allowed to cross.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, these people had not only kidnapped her but hurt her too.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From what this guy was saying, Sakra Society had come for revenge. This was going to be an ugly fight, no way around it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander took a deep breath, forcing his voice to stay steady. "Just tell me where you are. We can meet and talk about your demands face to face."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The other end went quiet again before that chilling, raspy voice came back. "Smart move, Alexander. I'll give you this chance. Meet me at Forest Park in an hour. And you better come alone</span><span>&mdash;</span><span>or you'll be picking up this woman's body instead!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, the line went dead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Forest Park," Alexander muttered, his face hardening. Sakra Society had really come prepared this time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Rosalia tried reaching the bodyguards, there was no response. That couldn't be good news.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander turned to her with urgent instructions</span><span>&mdash;</span><span>keep Ava safe, no matter what.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He also contacted Betty, telling her to beef up security in case Sakra Society tried anything funny.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Betty wanted to send backup, but Alexander shut that down </span><span>real</span><span> quick.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Sakra Society had planned this whole thing out, they definitely came prepared and confident.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Regular backup wouldn't just be useless. They'd probably end up getting in his way and slowing him down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So</span><span> Alexander decided to handle this alone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if these guys were tougher than Stephen, he was sure he could take them down and get Lynn back on his own.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"One hour!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander checked the time before jumping into an SUV and gunning it north.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was the dead of night, with just a sliver of moon hanging in the sky as he sped along with his high beams blazing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon enough, he pulled up near Forest Park.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The place was pitch black and eerily quiet, without a soul in sight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander parked his ride in a secluded spot by some trees before silently making his way deeper into the park.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Sakra Society people were definitely hiding somewhere, probably thinking he'd reach out for the exact location once he got close. Otherwise, finding anyone in a place as huge as Forest Park would be like looking for a needle in a haystack.</span></p><div class="pagination">
