  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Before the former senior executive of the Brilliant Group, they were cautious. They were wary of the powerful figure pulling the strings behind Betty, a true mastermind controlling the magic powder formula.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Ms. Rowe, Mr. Bogart from Everlasting Group would like to meet with you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Ms. Rowe, the folks from the Cripples have been waiting for two hours.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Ms. Rowe..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Betty waved her hand dismissively, her patience wearing thin.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Not a chance. I'm not Billy; if you want the rights to magic powder, you'll need to get in line for the next meeting."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Many influential leaders had received promises from Billy about securing magic powder distribution, but now those assurances were nothing but broken dreams under Betty's rule.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Yet, they dared not confront her; all they could do was plead for her favor.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Magic powder, oh magic powder&mdash;it truly holds magnificent power," Betty mused, a newfound respect for Alexander creeping in.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Suddenly, the office door burst open with a resounding crash.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Who dares act like a fool in here?" Betty barked, her anger palpable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Ms. Rowe, it seems you've got quite the reputation!" Sebastian's voice dripped with menace as he strode in, flanked by a gang of enforcers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Betty's expression hardened instantly. "Sebastian, what brings you here?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With a huff, Sebastian said, "Ms. Rowe, you're the General Manager of our Loscity branch. What's this betrayal all about? Did we do something to wrong you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Facing his intimidating presence, Betty steadied herself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She knew exactly why Sebastian was here; she had long been prepared with a trump card of her own.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mr. Sebastian Tate, are you here to settle a score?" Betty asked, her tone sharp.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Sebastian asked, "Where did you acquire the magic powder? Who controls the formula?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If you come clean, I might let the past slide. What do you say?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Betty smiled back, radiating confidence. "Mr. Sebastian Tate, the formula is firmly in the hands of my boss. You really don't want to cross that line."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Sebastian slammed his hand on the table, fury radiating from him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"How dare you! Who's beyond my reach anymore? Just hand it over. Maybe I'll let you off easy. Otherwise..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He glared at Betty, his eyes a storm of emotion, lingering too long on her boobs.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Otherwise, what?" Betty asked, her tone dripping with sarcasm as she casually waved a hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In an instant, crimson laser dots flickered to life, pinpointing Sebastian's chest and forehead.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Snipers!?" Sebastian exclaimed, his confidence faltering.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His men reached for their weapons, but Sebastian raised a hand. "Hold on. I'll handle this with Ms. Rowe."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He pulled out a sleek black card and placed it on the table.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Ms. Rowe, this card holds 50 million dollars. Hand over the name of the person behind this operation, and it's all yours."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Betty scoffed, saying, "Fifty million dollars? Are you kidding? That's chump change!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Sebastian, undeterred, quickly produced another card. "Here's 100 million dollars. Enough for you to live a lavish life!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Betty chuckled. "Even if I agreed, what about those snipers outside? Would they play along?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With a grim expression, he pulled out yet another card.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What if I said 200 million dollars? Just give us the name, and that's what you'll walk away with!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Two hundred million dollars for the mastermind behind the magic powder? Sebastian saw it as a steal.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Betty picked up the three cards, and he felt a surge of hope.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But to his shock, she ripped them in half right before his eyes and tossed the pieces back at him, a smirk on her face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Sebastian felt the heat of humiliation wash over him. "Betty, don't push your luck!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Sebastian, this isn't the Brilliant Group. This is the Ultimate Alliance. You think you can intimidate me here?" Betty shot back, defiance sparking in her eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The three laser sights remained unwavering on Sebastian's forehead and chest, a chilling reminder of the danger surrounding him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Sebastian's forces were numerous, but with the three snipers zeroed in on him, he'd be dead before he knew it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The tension in the air was palpable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Betty, you've proven your point. We're leaving."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Sebastian, unwilling to push his luck, turned to leave.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Not so fast!" Betty's voice cut through the silence like a blade.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Sebastian's face hardened. "Are you asking for death?"</p><div class="pagination">
