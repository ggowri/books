With these hundreds of kilograms of meteorites, he could refine a Lightsaber with enough meteorites.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay, I have to go check it out!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was also very interested in the thing that Lynne mentioned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lynne smiled and leaned close to Alexander's ear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She said, "Mr. Hawthorne, since you are interested in scientific research materials, you will also be interested in the Red Umbrella Group's latest research result, the Potency Potion!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She rubbed her plump body against Alexander, believing that he would not give up this opportunity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Potential potion? What is that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander asked curiously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lynne quickly explained in detail.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Last year, the Red Umbrella Group developed a potential drug that could stimulate the body's hidden abilities and increase lifespan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If an ordinary person took this potential potion, his running speed would be qualified to join the Olympics, and his strength would be much greater than that of ordinary people.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Whether for an athlete or a fighting master, after taking the potential potion, the effect would be even more terrifying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both speed and strength could be increased by more than 50%.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lynne said with some pride, "The 100-meter sprinters who broke world records recently had taken this potential potion. Moreover, these drugs act on genes and cannot be detected as stimulants."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander suddenly understood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Potential Potion has only been on the market for a short time, and the production is very limited, so it is very valuable. Currently, even in the top circles, not many people can buy it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Because the Brilliant Group has a cooperation agreement with the Red Umbrella Group, we are fortunate to be able to purchase some at a high price."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lynne had a proud expression on her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay! I want this potential potion."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander agreed immediately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lynne was immediately overjoyed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne, I'm sorry to ask, do you have enough funds? The potential potion is very valuable, probably costs more than one billion dollars..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She looked at Alexander nervously and expectantly, fearing that Alexander would </span><span>give up due to a lack of money, which would result in a loss of a large commission.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry about the money. As long as the product is good, I can get it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was calm and composed, showing the demeanor of a generous boss.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's great, Mr. Hawthorne, this way please!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lynne happily led the way, and the two came to a special elevator.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The other waitresses looked at Lynne with envy, because only top guests could use this elevator to go underground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lynne pressed the floor button and the elevator descended rapidly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The elevator stopped on the eighth underground floor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was a little surprised. It turned out that the entire square had been hollowed out and a huge underground fortress had been built.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Guzman's strength should not be underestimated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ding-dong!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When the elevator door opened, a row of fully armed guards immediately surrounded them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>More than a dozen black gun muzzles were pointed at Alexander and Lynne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lynne quickly showed her work badge and said, "This is our most distinguished guest, qualified to shop here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The guards looked at Alexander for a few seconds before putting down their guns.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lynne operated the LCD security device next to her, first entering the password and then pressing her fingerprint.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Identity is correct, employee No. 116 Lynne, welcome in!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Following the welcome announcement, the fully armed guards returned to their positions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne, I'm sorry to have scared you. This is the restricted area of our trading center. No entry without permission, so the security measures are stricter."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lynne explained embarrassedly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander nodded and followed Lynne with a serious expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Where would Guzman be hiding?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Guzman hid in an airtight fortress, it would be a bit troublesome for Alexander to eliminate him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two walked through a quiet corridor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The floor was covered with thick carpet, and it was silent to walk on it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander looked around and found that there were surveillance cameras everywhere, as well as infrared thermal imaging and laser locking devices.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This proved that there was a hidden firepower point here, and once people were locked on, they couldn't escape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The products that could be placed here were rare on the market.</span></p><div class="pagination">
