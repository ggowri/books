  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's taxi slammed into&nbsp;Ariella's car and hit it into the store on the street. The taxi then crashed into the counter, and the scene was a mess.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The few cars ahead rushed over, and several men got out of them with guns.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosalia hurried out of the car with a dagger in her hand. A thread of light&nbsp;flashed, and the next second, a man in front of the group fell, clutching his neck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, Rosalia cut off two men's heads, and blood was sprayed into the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The others of the group exclaimed in fear and stepped back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, someone in the car held a submachine gun and shot at Rosalia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Intensive bullets hit the cars, and Rosalia had to take shelter temporarily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, the man who was shooting saw a shadow in front of him. He paused for a moment and then quickly raised his gun to aim.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next second, however, he felt a sharp pain in his neck, and he saw his back. Alexander twisted and broke the man's neck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man didn't know who had just killed him and then died.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander picked up the submachine gun and started shooting, and every shot would hit a person.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those people hid behind cars and trees and in bushes, but they would be shot as long as they showed a little bit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, all the men who had just gotten out of these cars were dead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The submachine gun clicked, and the bullets were finished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, a driver rushed out of the car and ran away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander threw the submachine gun, and the gun stung the driver's head, which exploded like fireworks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A man who had an injury on his thigh got up from the bush and limped to run.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander rushed over like an arrow. That man fell to the ground in an instant, and his head was dented by Alexander's palm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Two robust men climbed out of the crashed car and wanted to stand up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before they could react, Rosalia's dagger stabbed into a man's heart, and the blood splashed onto the car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The other man took out a pistol and shot at Rosalia. They were close to each other, and Rosalia hurriedly dodged. Several bullets brushed against her body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it!" A man was roaring in the car. The next second, fierce gunfire rang out, and flames came out of the broken window.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The driver in the car was attacking Rosalia with a submachine gun.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosalia deftly rolled and dodged all the bullets.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander sneered and suddenly appeared in front of the car. He pulled open the twisted door and dragged the man out of the car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The gunfire stopped, and Alexander broke the man's neck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, Alexander grabbed the doorknob of the back door and pulled the car door. The deformed door flew and fell to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He rescued Ariella, who was trapped in the car and broke her handcuffs easily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ariella was messy, shivering, and looking at Alexander in horror.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosalia rushed over and hugged Ariella. "It's me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ariella saw Rosalia and immediately embraced her. They looked at each other, crying and smiling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosalia asked in confusion, "Ariella, with your</span><span> strong</span><span> strength, </span><span>why were you </span><span>caught by these bastards?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ariella looked dim and said with a wry smile, "Rosalia, I have been poisoned by Chase's chronic poison. I can't exert my strength."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You are poisoned? Don't be afraid. You'll definitely be cured." Rosalia turned to Alexander for help.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander comforted, "Don't worry, Rosalia. Let's take her </span><span>away</span><span> first, and then I'll help her detoxify."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He used Force Sense and knew what poison Ariella had in her body. He could cure Ariella, but it was a little troublesome to solve this chronic poison.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, in front of Rosalia, Alexander didn't explain much.</span></p><div class="pagination">
