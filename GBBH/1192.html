  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Black Widow squad was no joke</span><span>&mdash;</span><span>they could take down even high-level metahumans with a single strike. Regular humans didn't stand a chance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But going up against Alexander was a whole different story. As the only Advanced Warrior, he was completely out of their league.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's kick sent Venom Wolf flying like a soccer ball hammered by a goalkeeper. Blood sprayed through the air as he sailed across the sky, looking like some twisted version of rain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Drawing a perfect arc through the air, Venom Wolf tumbled down the hillside</span><span>&mdash;</span><span>the first to fall to Alexander's power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the next instant, three throwing knives sliced through the air, all finding their mark on Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Haha! Go die, you bastard!" Red Eye shouted triumphantly. His poisoned blades were guaranteed to kill within thirty seconds of a hit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the celebration died in his throat. The knives had struck nothing but an afterimage</span><span>&mdash;</span><span>Alexander was just too damn fast. They couldn't even track his movements.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the knives clattered to the ground, Alexander suddenly materialized in front of them. He casually picked one up, examining it with a smirk and a shake of his head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a sickening crunch, Alexander crushed the steel-forged throwing knife in his bare hand, crumpling it into a ball like it was made of paper.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What... what kind of monster are you?" Red Eye's voice cracked with hysteria, and his whole body trembled with a fear he'd never known before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a blur of motion, Alexander's hand whipped across Red Eye's face. The impact sent him crashing to the ground, and blood sprayed from his mouth as he lay there. He was too broken to even crawl.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The strike had caved in his skull. Red Eye was dead before he hit the floor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Black Widow stood frozen, and jaw dropped. Her will to fight completely evaporated as she faced Alexander's overwhelming power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hyena already had </span><span>his</span><span> </span><span>sniper rifle trained on Alexander, and </span><span>his</span><span> </span><span>finger squeezed the trigger as </span><span>he</span><span> </span><span>roared, "Go die, you bastard!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The muzzle flashed as the armor-piercing round exploded from the barrel. The bullet streaked through the air like lightning, heading straight for Alexander's head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this point-blank range, the bullet was moving too fast for anyone to dodge. And with that massive caliber, even a graze would turn his head into pink mist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both Black Widow and Hyena broke into grins, with Hyena feeling particularly smug. When it really counted, they'd pulled through, thanks to </span><span>him</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is my chance," Hyena thought, "I could replace Black Widow as this team</span><span>&rsquo;</span><span>s</span><span> leader."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A flash of brilliant white light suddenly erupted in front of Alexander, intercepting the armor-piercing round.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was a soft hiss, and the bullet split cleanly in two. The pieces clattered to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The supposedly indestructible round began to melt, no match for the light blade's </span><span>intense heat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What the hell kind of sword is that? That's impossible!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Horror filled Hyena's eyes as </span><span>he</span><span> </span><span>struggled to process what he'd just witnessed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yinson was right about you," Black Widow spat out, "You're nothing but a demon crawling up from hell to screw everything up. You deserve to die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Chatty women never end well." Alexander casually flicked his wrist with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Black Widow's head hit the ground and rolled, and her eyes were frozen wide with horror. Her body crumpled like a puppet with cut strings, twitching on the concrete.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Hyena could get off another shot, Alexander materialized behind him like a ghost.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hyena's body went rigid. He tried to run, but the searing pain in his back stopped him cold. His vision went dark, and then, darkness swallowed him whole.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In just seconds, Alexander had sent Sakra Society's elite death squad straight to hell. Four of their best assassins were reduced to bloody heaps on the ground. Their deaths were brutal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander methodically searched the bodies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Between these guys and Rico's crew, they were packing enough firepower to start a small war. No way they'd slipped through port security without inside help.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He quickly found a clue on Black Widow's body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, well. Tim Ramos, Port Operations Director at the Brilliant Group. You had a cushy corporate job, but you just had to play double agent. Can't say I feel sorry for what's coming next."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's cold laugh echoed as he vanished into the night, heading for the luxury condos on the island's north side.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As a high-ranking executive in the Brilliant Group and the one in charge of port affairs, Tim enjoyed the best perks the company had to offer.</span></p><div class="pagination">
