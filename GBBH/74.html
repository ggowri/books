  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Theodore's laughter echoed through the room as he saw Alexander lose his composure.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You're nothing but a waste of space, Alexander! Even your wife and daughter aren't really yours. Ava will bow to me, and you'll always be the lowest of the low."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mr. Tate, please don't keep rubbing it in. You're going to give him a heart attack."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yeah, Mr. Tate, why don't you just knock Jane up again? Show this loser how far apart you really are!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Theodore's henchmen joined in, their taunts flying thick and fast.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The guests murmured among themselves, laughter and mockery rippling through the crowd.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But Alexander didn't rise to the bait. Instead, he took a swift step forward and swung his hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The sound of the slap rang out like a gunshot, and Theodore staggered back, blood spilling from his mouth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Everyone froze, including the tattooed man, who couldn't keep up with Alexander's speed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Theodore clutched his swollen cheek, fury bubbling over. "You... you slapped me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"That was for my daughter," Alexander replied coolly, and before Theodore could react, he delivered another powerful slap that sent Theodore crashing to the ground.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"And this one's for myself."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Fuming, Theodore shouted, "You're dead, Alexander! I swear I'll kill you!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In all his life, apart from his uncle and father, no one had ever dared to strike him like that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander's gaze was cold. "I believe in repaying kindness with kindness, and vengeance with vengeance. You insult my daughter today, and I'll break both your hands."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Theodore turned pale as a ghost.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Silence fell over the crowd; no one expected Alexander to not only slap Theodore in public but also threaten to cripple him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Enough!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The tattooed man snapped out of his shock and charged at Alexander, throwing a punch that seemed to cut through the air like a freight train.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You're gonna regret this!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander didn't flinch. Instead, he met the punch head-on.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The two fists collided with a loud crack, and the tattooed man's right hand hung limply at his side, broken.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Pain surged through him, and he clutched his shattered wrist, eyes wide with disbelief.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"My... my hand!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He had thrown a punch that could shatter stone, yet it had been effortlessly countered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander raised an eyebrow, surprised to find his own wrist tingling. The tattooed man's punch had contained some mysterious inner strength&mdash;an internal force he hadn't anticipated.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"This guy is the toughest opponent I've faced so far," Alexander thought, impressed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I told you I'd break your hands, and now there's no one to save you," Alexander declared, striding toward Theodore.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Everyone, attack! Get him!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Panic set in as Theodore shouted for his men to swarm Alexander.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A dozen black-clad bodyguards surged forward, but they couldn't stop Alexander's advance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">One by one, they fell to the ground, unable to withstand even a single punch from him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You're dead meat!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The tattooed man roared, channeling his rage as he lunged at Alexander again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Without even looking back, Alexander delivered a powerful kick.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The tattooed man flew across the room, crashing into the wall with a sickening thud.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He groaned in pain, unable to rise.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The remaining henchmen were either knocked out cold or too terrified to make a move against Alexander.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The crowd, once filled with jeers and laughter, now stood in stunned silence, slowly backing away, afraid of being caught in the crossfire.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Some had witnessed Alexander's fight with Joseph before, but they never imagined he could unleash such ferocity.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Now they understood why Ava had chosen him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A powerhouse like Alexander was someone any faction would want to recruit.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Andrew stammered in shock, "How is this possible? He... he used to let us beat him up and belittle him, didn't he?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jane glanced at Theodore, now a pitiable mess on the floor, and then at Alexander, who stood tall and commanding, exuding an aura of power. An overwhelming sense of regret washed over her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Have I really made a mistake?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jane's emotions were in turmoil, torn between guilt and despair.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Theodore, scrambling and desperate, tried to make his escape, but Alexander was already right in front of Theodore, his gaze dripping with disdain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Alexander, think this through. Maiming me is a serious crime. I'll call the police, and with so many witnesses, you'll end up behind bars for a long time!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Theodore's attempt to leverage legal threats against Alexander was nothing short of absurd.</p><div class="pagination">
