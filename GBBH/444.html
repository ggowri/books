  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix spoke in a deep voice, "Kyle, you already possess fire power, making you a level-one metahuman. Ordinary strongmen are no match for you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But even Guzman ended in Alexander's hands. Guzman was a wizard and had the Ancestral Witch's Cane, the sacred artifact of the City of Sorcery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, we can't underestimate Alexander. We must capture Ashley to ensure Alexander complies!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kyle snorted coldly in displeasure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Since when have I ever been afraid of anyone? Can't I handle a twenty-something punk?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Felix took out his phone and called Ella.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop dragging your feet. We move today! If I don't see Ashley before nightfall, I'll upload your indecent videos online for everyone to see what a tease you are."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Turning to Kyle, he said, "Kyle, head to the kindergarten. Bring Ashley back at all costs."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Got it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kyle clenched his fists excitedly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ella stood pale at the kindergarten, so lost that she didn't even notice her phone had fallen to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Purnell, why are you crying? Did you get sand in your eyes? Let me blow it out for you," Ashley said, comforting her in a childlike voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's nothing. I'm fine..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ella hugged Ashley, tears streaming down her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alice, along with several men in black, personally guarded the basement door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Outside the villa, several snipers and a dozen hidden and visible sentries surrounded the place, making it impenetrable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A black Rolls-Royce approached and was stopped at a checkpoint a hundred yards from the villa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The leader, upon seeing Ava, immediately bowed and apologized.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sorry, Ms. Blackburn. Please come in!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Rolls-Royce pulled into the parking spot. Ava, with Rosalia, hurried into the villa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Hollister, what's going on? What about Alexander?" Ava asked anxiously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alice quickly comforted her, "Ms. Blackburn, there's no need to worry. Mr. Hawthorne is secluding himself for three days and doesn't want to be disturbed. Our chairman specifically asked me to protect Mr. Hawthorne."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava immediately asked, "What is the relationship between your chairman and Alexander?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had always suspected that Alexander was the chairman of the Saint Group but couldn't confirm it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alice smiled mysteriously and said enviously to Ava, "Ms. Blackburn, I dare not speak out of turn about this matter. If you really want to know, you can ask Mr. Hawthorne directly after he comes out of seclusion. Actually, you don't need to worry. You will have your answers soon."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava frowned and finally stopped asking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosalia stared at the closed door, muttering to herself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Master is in seclusion? His power must be increasing again... What a powerful man!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking of the pleasure of being intimate with Alexander, she felt a sudden longing, and unconsciously, her body limp, and she clenched her thighs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, Betty brought dozens of elites from the Ultimate Alliance, surrounding the villa layer by layer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing this, Ava finally let out a long sigh of relief. She had always been worried about something happening to Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it! Ashley!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She suddenly panicked and rushed to the kindergarten with her people.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosalia hurriedly comforted her. "Ms. Blackburn, Charlize has a team protecting Miss Hawthorne. She will definitely be fine."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Ava was uneasy, feeling that something big was about to happen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She ordered the driver urgently, "Faster! Get us to the kindergarten as quickly as possible!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, the kindergarten was in chaos.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Charlize lay on the ground, charred and gasping for breath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her military knife had turned black from the heat, and her once smooth and delicate body was now red and swollen with blisters.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Several elites from the Ultimate Alliance lay charred in pools of blood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kyle stood in front of Charlize, his foot on her chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He sneered, "Bitch! Do you still have the strength to resist? A mere mortal daring to fight me? You're asking for death!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Charlize spat on Kyle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just wait and see! My boss will kill you."</span></p><div class="pagination">
