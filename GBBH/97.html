  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Betty drew her pistol and aimed it directly at one of Sebastian's henchmen.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"This is the Ultimate Alliance, not some free-for-all. You can't just waltz in and out whenever you please. One of you has to stay behind!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Sebastian's face flushed with rage.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What the hell is this Ultimate Alliance crap? I've never even heard of it! You lay a finger on my people, and I'll..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Before he could finish, Betty fired a shot, making Sebastian flinch.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The man with the bloodied chest fell to the ground, terror, and shock etched on his face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Now, you can get lost," Betty said with a sweet smile, waving them off.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Sebastian's face cycled through a range of emotions before he finally, grudgingly, decided it wasn't worth the risk. Reluctantly, he turned to leave with his men.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Stop right there!" Betty's voice rang out again, halting them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Sebastian was furious, ready to go down swinging.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But Betty tossed a golden-embossed invitation in front of him and said coolly, "Here's an invitation to the symposium. It's at 10 a.m. the day after tomorrow, and Mr. Sebastian Tate, you're expected."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Sebastian studied the invitation, then asked, "Will the person behind you be attending?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Of course," Betty replied without hesitation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Sebastian said nothing more and walked away in silence, his anger simmering as he got into his car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He spat on the ground in frustration once he was out of the bar.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Damn it, you'll pay for this. I swear, if I don't make you suffer!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He left, thoroughly disgruntled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Meanwhile, inside the building across the street, Augusta, Marvin, and Logan packed away their sniper rifles with satisfied smiles.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">News of Sebastian, the president of the Brilliant Group, attending the "Magic Powder Symposium" quickly spread throughout Loscity.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The mysterious figure behind the magic powder formula was drawing even more attention.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Though the event was still days away, it had already become the city's hottest topic!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">*****</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the evening, as the city lights began to twinkle, Ava hummed cheerfully while busy in the kitchen.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She wore a flirty apron and flitted around the room like a butterfly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Ava, did you hear what I said? Alexander is secretly meeting his ex-wife. Aren't you going to do anything about it?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Rebecca, looking worried and exasperated, couldn't believe Ava wasn't more concerned about being deceived.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The secretary chimed in, "Ms. Blackburn, why are you doing all this housework? You should let someone else handle it. Men don't like overly domesticated women; they prefer something new."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava, maintaining her serene smile, didn't respond.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She was discovering for the first time how much joy she found in preparing a meal for someone she loved.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Rebecca was persistent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Ava, I'm not lying. I saw them together with my own eyes. They were even hugging."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava simply smiled in return, saying, "Rebecca, I appreciate your concern, but I trust Alexander. He's not like that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Stop being so naive. Get back to work. Alexander will be here soon, and I still have one dish left to finish."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava had been working in the kitchen all day, preparing a candlelit dinner for Alexander.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Rebecca felt her good intentions were being brushed off and stormed out, fuming.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Ava, you'll regret this. I'm going to expose Alexander for who he really is!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With that, Rebecca slammed the door behind her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava shook her head with a wry smile. Her friend's prejudice against Alexander was far too deep.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As dusk fell and the city lights came alive, Ava had set a beautiful table for a sumptuous dinner.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The living room was aglow with warm orange candlelight, creating an atmosphere of indescribable coziness and warmth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The secretary had been sent away to wait outside, leaving just Alexander and Ava alone in the spacious room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Are you actually cooking? Did you make all this for me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander could hardly believe his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was astounding to him that someone as prominent as Ava would go out of her way to cook and invite him over.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Thinking back to the five years he spent with Jane, where he was always the one buying groceries and cooking, Alexander couldn't help but feel a bit of regret.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava gently placed a piece of meat onto Alexander's plate and flashed him a warm, inviting smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Try my cooking and let me know how it is. I hope we have a wonderful evening together."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her flirtatious tone stirred something inside Alexander, filling him with a mix of excitement and anticipation.</p><div class="pagination">
