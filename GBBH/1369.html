  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The land deed clearly stated:&nbsp;Darwin's&nbsp;southern&nbsp;Kean Manor, spanning&nbsp;three miles&nbsp;in every direction, with&nbsp;865 households&nbsp;residing within.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Three miles of land was roughly&nbsp;500 hectares or 7,500 acres.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander had been stressing over where to secure a fief. Now, with this unexpected gift of land, including 865 people.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The New Year's feast is ready. Should I bring it in?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Outside the door, Clyde's voice rang out. Logan immediately shouted,&nbsp;"I'm starving to death over here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clyde pushed the door open and carried in two large food boxes, setting them down on the table. The meal consisted of&nbsp;eight hot dishes, four cold dishes,&nbsp;a&nbsp;small cask of premium wine,&nbsp;and a&nbsp;small wooden tub of rice, filling the table completely before he took his leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander popped open the wine jar's clay seal, releasing a rich, intoxicating aroma into the room. He poured drinks for everyone, then raised his cup.&nbsp;"Thank you all! Happy New Year!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Logan bellowed,&nbsp;"Happy New Year!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vegeta and Nova didn't fully understand the words, but they knew it was a New Year's celebration. They lifted their bowls and downed their drinks in one go.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laughter, playful insults, and boisterous chatter filled the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Outside, Darwin City erupted with the deafening crackle of fireworks, signaling the arrival of a new year.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the&nbsp;fourth floor&nbsp;of&nbsp;the Manual House&nbsp;at&nbsp;Dominion Church, a spacious hall housed a&nbsp;boxwood bookshelf.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were only a handful of books on the shelves. At this moment, Alexander sat flipping through&nbsp;St. Paul's Marrow-Cleansing Classic. After three days of rest without being able to train in martial arts, boredom set in. Might as well study St. Paul's Marrow-Cleansing Classic for now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Primordial Bell's internal energy, where mortals and saints converge... Whether walking, standing, sitting, or lying down, one must integrate the marrow and primordial essence..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It took Alexander a full&nbsp;four hours&nbsp;to memorize the entire text. He let out a long sigh.&nbsp;"A hundred thousand martial virtue points and twenty thousand coins... Worth it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bone marrow was essential to the body's foundation. If it was weak, the muscles and bones wouldn't be strong either. However, since marrow was hidden deep within the bones, refining it was like scratching an itch through a boot; it was a slow, painstaking process. Those with poor aptitude might never succeed in their lifetime.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rhodes had shattered Alexander's bones when he attacked. His&nbsp;spine&nbsp;had nearly been&nbsp;crushed. But in this state, practicing&nbsp;Marrow-Cleansing Classic&nbsp;actually worked in his favor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His fractured bones were riddled with tiny cracks, allowing&nbsp;the Force&nbsp;to penetrate his entire skeletal structure. As a result, marrow refinement became far more efficient.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover,&nbsp;marrow produced blood. Weak marrow led to weak vitality, but if the marrow was strengthened, so was the blood. Half of Alexander's&nbsp;vital energy&nbsp;had already been depleted, making this the perfect time to practice. As his marrow strengthened, his vitality would naturally be restored.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander chuckled bitterly,&nbsp;"At this rate, I should be thanking Rhodes! According to the Valdez brothers, it took Rhodes ten years to advance from a level-three warrior to a half-step level-five warrior. He's considered a once-in-a-generation prodigy. So... how long will it take me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After finishing the&nbsp;Marrow-Cleansing Classic, Alexander glanced at his&nbsp;tattered gold-threaded robe&nbsp;and sighed. He needed to visit&nbsp;the Treasure House.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Standing in front of the boxwood shelf&nbsp;on the third floor of&nbsp;the Treasure House, Alexander was stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The last time he came, he had&nbsp;no martial virtue points&nbsp;or&nbsp;coins, so he had only been able to take a free&nbsp;gold-threaded robe&nbsp;before leaving.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, after spending&nbsp;100,000 martial virtue points&nbsp;on&nbsp;Marrow-Cleansing Classic, he had&nbsp;6,000&nbsp;points left. Being a&nbsp;silver badge holder, he had accumulated these over the past six months in the&nbsp;Outer Court.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had planned to browse both the&nbsp;boxwood&nbsp;and&nbsp;rosewood&nbsp;shelves. But to his surprise, the third floor didn't just have armor; it also had&nbsp;mystical artifacts. One of them, on the boxwood shelf, was a&nbsp;Dimensional Pouch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At first glance, it looked like an ordinary&nbsp;cloth pouch, about&nbsp;the size of a palm. However, its description claimed it could&nbsp;block blades and swords, and it contained an&nbsp;internal space of ten feet, allowing for convenient storage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the&nbsp;rosewood shelf, Alexander spotted&nbsp;a silver-colored Dimensional Pouch, clearly an upgraded version.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander tossed a&nbsp;silver-coin note worth 50,000 coins&nbsp;into the&nbsp;offering box, then placed his&nbsp;silver badge&nbsp;on the pouch. Instantly,&nbsp;5,000&nbsp;martial virtue points vanished, and the&nbsp;Dimensional Pouch&nbsp;became his.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This&nbsp;pouch&nbsp;was indeed extraordinary. After&nbsp;dripping a drop of blood&nbsp;onto it, he could sense the space within it just by focusing his thoughts. It really did have a&nbsp;ten-foot&nbsp;storage capacity&mdash;more than enough for his needs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for armor? He only had&nbsp;1,000 martial virtue points&nbsp;left. He had to let that go for now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the blink of an eye,&nbsp;six months passed. Though Alexander's&nbsp;bones hadn't fully healed, after&nbsp;half a year&nbsp;of training&nbsp;Marrow-Cleansing Classic&nbsp;and&nbsp;Muscle-Tendon Classic, his&nbsp;meridians and bones&nbsp;had undergone a complete transformation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With his&nbsp;golden energy, he was now likely on equal footing with Rhodes. Even when his&nbsp;muscles were cut, his&nbsp;blood&nbsp;had begun to take on an unusual property. The tiny&nbsp;silver flecks&nbsp;shimmered within, a sign that his&nbsp;blood refinement process&nbsp;was approaching a breakthrough.</span></p><div class="pagination">
