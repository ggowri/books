After all, Grace had given him her first time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He gently brushed his hand across Grace's smooth cheek and then lightly traced her ear, slowly moving down, starting to climb her full breasts...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ugh, don't touch me. Go find Ava!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Grace panted, pressing his hand down, though there was no real strength behind it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander chuckled softly. The way she acted wasn't a refusal; it was more like a playful resistance, one that invited him even more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He had just suppressed her, but now it was time to offer her something in return.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Lawson family was important to Alexander. Whether his actions were shameless or not didn't matter to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A man who wanted to achieve great things cared only about success or failure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the animal world, only those who could catch their prey survived!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As a woman from a prestigious family, Grace surely understood that the more powerful a man was, the less likely he was to settle for just one woman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Don't be angry anymore. I don't like it when you fight with Ava. It makes me feel bad, you know?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>While speaking sweet words, Alexander remained firm as he began taking Grace's clothes off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the midst of her mixed signals, Grace had unknowingly ended up completely undressed by Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When she lifted her hips to let Alexander remove the last piece of her lingerie, she felt a bit relieved but still shy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Please... No... Not in the car. How about we go to a hotel instead? Please, I'm begging you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Grace pleaded with her face flushed red.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander chuckled, savoring the sight of Grace's seductive charm, his heart filled with a sense of triumph as he prepared to take the next step.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"But that's exactly what I want. It's exciting, isn't it? Relax, it's so remote here. No one's going to come."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With Alexander's comforting words, kisses, and gentle touches, Grace no longer resisted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Pervert! You already have so many women around you. Why do you still want me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She shot him a seductive glance and then slid her hand into Alexander's pants, playing with him lingeringly, unwilling to let go.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She no longer had that previous air of pretension. Instead, she was completely captivated by Alexander's charm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander couldn't help but feel a surge of pride. After all, who could resist his exceptional abilities?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Come on, let me see what you've got. Didn't you say before that you wanted to sleep with me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Grace blushed furiously when she heard Alexander's teasing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She playfully gave him a light tug, her eyes flashing with mock anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Pervert! It was you who wanted to sleep with me. Today, I'll teach you a lesson. If you're going to flirt with a woman like me, you better be ready to pay the price. Now let's see what you've really got."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With that, Grace pushed Alexander down, spun around, and straddled him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ugh!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander took a deep breath. The tight, exquisite feeling was simply amazing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Though Grace had only been through this once before, she had already shed her previous awkwardness and was surprisingly fierce.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The voluptuous, curvy hips swayed back and forth, and any ordinary man would probably surrender within a minute, unable to resist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Alexander had the Force. He was more than capable of withstanding the challenge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The car shook violently, jolting back and forth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At that moment, someone stood at the corner in the distance, watching them closely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Grace didn't notice, but they couldn't escape Alexander's keen senses. It was Howard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Howard, with a bandage wrapped around his left leg, sat in a wheelchair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Hey! Mr. Lawson, isn't that Grace's car? Is there something wrong? The car is shaking so badly. Something must have happened, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A burly man asked Howard, confused.</span></p><div class="pagination">
