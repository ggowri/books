  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melin's lips quivered, holding back words she couldn't bring herself to say.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, she let out a sigh and led Alexander to the airport's security room to review the surveillance footage of the recent murder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The video showed a masked man with a noticeable limp shuffling past Ken.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a split second, they passed each other, and Ken's body suddenly erupted with multiple gashes. Blood sprayed like a fountain, and chunks of flesh scattered across the floor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ken's eyes were wide open, still moving, his face frozen in terror.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At average speed, Melin couldn't make out how the limping man had killed Ken.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only when she slowed the footage to its lowest speed could they barely catch a blur of movement - just a single, lightning-quick flash.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander narrowed his eyes, muttering under his breath, "That's some insane speed."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This killer's skills were off the charts. His blade work was faster than any of Alexander's men, maybe even faster than Felix.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ken's just a piece of trash.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Why would he kill someone here?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What's his angle?" Alexander wondered aloud.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melin massaged her temples, her voice tense with frustration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"First the plague, now this super-assassin. What the hell is happening to </span><span>Loscity</span><span>?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander flashed a confident smile. "Don't worry. I'll track him down."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Melin moved closer, nestled into Alexander's embrace, and coquettishly said, "I miss you. Have you been thinking about me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander pointed to the door of the monitoring room and said, "There are airport security guards outside. What if they hear us?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, don't worry. This place is soundproof. They can't hear us, and the door is already locked from the inside. They can't get in."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a grin, Alexander pulled her onto the sofa, admiring the alluring way Melin took off her police uniform.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melin unbuttoned each button one by one, her exceptionally ample breasts immediately eager to be revealed, trembling enticingly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her puckered hips shed her police pants, revealing tight black leggings underneath. The waistband dug into the groove of her buttocks, making her cheeks appear more prominent and even more captivating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unable to resist, Alexander leaned in to caress her greedily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melin giggled as she touched Alexander's groin, instantly igniting the spark.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander pressed her face down onto the sofa, yanking off her large-sized bra and vigorously rubbing it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melin gasped softly, twisting her waist, her perked hips rubbing against Alexander's groin as she moved in circles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah, so big!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander ran his hands over her bare arms, moving down her waist, and squeezed her snowy white hips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You've never had a baby, so how is your butt so full and soft? It feels fantastic pressed against me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander leaned down and turned on his engine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melin was highly excited, breathing heavily and moaning lustfully. Her slightly </span><span>sagging breasts trembled enticingly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander reached out, tightly gripping the two big tits, tugging and kneading them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melin was no longer humming but was intermittently shouting, shaking her head and hips, wildly excited.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Please, slow down, slower... Ah!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the monitoring room, Melin's frenzied moans echoed...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Over an hour later, Alexander finally left the airport, while Melin still had to continue gathering clues for the murder case.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The image of the limping man from the video kept replaying in Alexander's mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Using his photographic memory, he reconstructed every detail of his meeting with Jane, like rewinding surveillance footage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Frame by frame, he played it back in slow motion...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, Alexander's eyes lit up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He remembered now! There had been a pair of unusually bright eyes watching from a corner in the crowd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That must have been the killer!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Like a predator skilled in stealth, the man had concealed his murderous intent perfectly, leaving no trace for Alexander to detect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The killer had been like a ghost, or better yet, a chameleon, ultimately blending into his surroundings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's gaze had swept right over him without registering anything suspicious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This guy was a real expert!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His skills definitely surpassed those of Shadow and Augusta.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With predator-like stealth abilities, he'd be absolutely lethal in an ambush or assassination.</span></p><div class="pagination">
