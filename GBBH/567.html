  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ten million dollars a month was astronomical for an average person.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even a typical wealthy person couldn't afford that kind of spending.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But for the extravagantly lavish lifestyle of Barry, he was practically broke.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Morris family's rules were strict. If Barry exceeded his spending limit again, he'd face severe punishment and could even be expelled from the family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, Barry was already broke, deeply in debt, a complete pauper.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix had made it clear he was out of money, but Barry was still fixated on winning. He was desperate to recoup his losses, caught up in a gambler's frenzy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Barry hesitating and not exchanging more chips, Jaylon and Finley launched into another round of cutting remarks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finley and Jaylon spat out taunting insults, each one like a knife stabbing into Barry's pride.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Barry, you're done already? Out of cash? Can't believe you're giving up after just a few hundred million," Jaylon mocked, his eyes full of contempt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come on, leave him alone, Barry's out of money," Finley jeered, "He should just get lost if he's broke!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even the attractive dealer asked in a seemingly caring voice, "Sir, would you like to continue playing? If not, please step aside, or kindly exchange for more chips if you want to keep playing."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barry's face turned pale, and he gritted his teeth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Haven't you heard of the Morris family? Who dares to say I'm broke? I'm playing, and I'll win it all back today!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Morris..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diego leaned close and gently advised him, "It's getting late. Maybe we should head back and rest."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joyce also said cautiously, "Mr. Morris, how about we go back? I'll help you with a </span><span>bath so you can relax..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barry cut her off sharply before she could finish.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shut up! Both of you, just shut up!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diego, Joyce, give me all the cash you have and exchange it for chips!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Desperate, Barry gave direct orders to Diego and Joyce.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diego frowned but still patiently advised in a low voice, "Mr. Morris, maybe it's best to call it quits...if you keep going, no amount of money will be enough..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Exactly, Mr. Morris, at this rate, even hundreds of billions wouldn't be enough."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joyce grew anxious; she'd finally saved a bit of her own money and didn't want Barry gambling it away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She knew he wouldn't repay her if he lost, and she didn't dare ask him for the debt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he kept gambling, he'd only get deeper into this losing streak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Barry's arrogance and his gambling addiction wouldn't let him give up so easily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Morris, let's just go," Joyce urged.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Let it go?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How could he let it go!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The more they tried to dissuade him, the more Barry clung on, his expression shifting with indecision.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, Alexander and Nancy's helicopter landed on the rooftop helipad.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Welcome, Ms. Tucker!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cole led a group of black-suited men, bowing respectfully to Nancy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Alexander holding Nancy around the waist, everyone froze in surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy was known to avoid getting close to men, let alone showing such public affection.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cole was stunned, wondering about Alexander's background.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy, her face expressionless, said, "This is my boyfriend, Alexander. What he says is what I say."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, Ms. Tucker!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone bowed their heads obediently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's the situation with Felix and Barry?" Alexander asked, his voice edged with concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cole quickly filled him in, and Alexander nodded, a slight smile forming as he pointed at Joyce on the surveillance screen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Make sure they win her over. Then we can use her as a way in to see what kind of plot Felix and Barry are hatching together."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Understood!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cole agreed immediately, relaying Alexander's orders to Finley and Jaylon via radio.</span></p><div class="pagination">
