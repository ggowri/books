  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the bustling streets, Alexander walked quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he neared the intersection by Brilliant Group, he found a crowd had already gathered, everyone craning their necks to catch a glimpse of the drama.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inside the crowd were the subordinates, drivers, and other underlings of various big shots, squeezing tightly together.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Move aside," Alexander waved his hand, and the outer circle of people was pushed away by an invisible, enormous force, stumbling and struggling to stay upright.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey, what are you doing? Don't push."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't push me, or I'll make you regret it..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd complained while retreating one after another.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get out of the way," Augusta shouted angrily, leading a few subordinates in a triangular arrow formation, charging forward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those subordinates were much rougher than Alexander. They combined their strength like a speeding train, charging forward recklessly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The pedestrians who had just been complaining were thrown hard to the ground, causing chaos.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander and his group, like a battleship cutting through the waves in the ocean, quickly arrived at the entrance of the Brilliant Tower.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a thunderous roar, Augusta clasped his ten fingers together, unleashing his power, and slammed it heavily onto the hood of a Rolls-Royce.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That terrifying force was like a giant boulder pressing down, instantly crushing the hood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The members of the Vanderbilt family beside them tried to block him. Augusta waved his hand, brushing them aside like swatting flies, knocking them to the ground. Those few people turned pale, crying out in pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why did you smash my car?" Skyla exclaimed in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Augusta pointed at her and scolded, "You have quite a nerve, daring to cause trouble at Brilliant Group?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The scene fell silent, so quiet that even the sound of a leaf falling could be heard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, you've finally come. I challenge you. I want to duel you. The loser will commit suicide on the spot."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Skyla saw Alexander, a fierce light flashed in her eyes. She ignored Augusta and stared </span><span>angril</span><span>y at Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Arlene widened her eyes, examining Alexander from head to toe, seemingly very surprised.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander, however, kept a straight face, emotionless, and said, "I indeed killed Felix because he deserved it. If you persist in evil, you will end up like him, too."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone present could feel that Alexander's contempt and disdain for Skyla came from the depths of his heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You bastard, you killed my son, and now you dare to threaten me?" Skyla was furious, trembling all over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then go to hell and find your son," Alexander retorted sharply.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Good, very good." Skyla glared viciously at Alexander. "I'll kill you first. No, I'll make you suffer a fate worse than death."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Cut the nonsense. You'll choose the way, so no one can say I'm bullying a woman," Alexander said confidently, exuding an intimidating aura.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Arlene had been observing Alexander, feeling the majestic presence he exuded, and couldn't help but be filled with admiration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought, "Even though our family is the top family in the Capital Region, none of the young men in my generation have the same presence as Alexander. He truly lives up to his reputation."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Skyla sneered with her expression as hideous as a demon. "We'll gamble with our lives. Do you dare?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone fell silent, wondering, "What does gambling with life mean?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava became nervous, staring wide-eyed at Skyla, waiting for her to continue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Skyla grinned maliciously and said, "We'll each take the other's poison. Whoever dies first loses."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This not only shocked Ava but also made Charlize and Augusta shiver.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The scene erupted into an uproar, with everyone discussing among themselves. "This way of dueling is too strange. It's practically suicide."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sir, you can't agree. She knows witchcraft and is skilled in using poison. You can't fall for it." Charlize was the first to stop Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sir, you can't," Augusta also disagreed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although they all knew Alexander was very powerful, taking poison made by a witch was a surefire way to die.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry. Whatever way she wants to duel, I don't object." Alexander remained calm and composed, his cold gaze sweeping over Skyla and Arlene.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Arlene couldn't help but shiver, feeling as if those deep eyes had completely seen through her, leaving no secrets hidden.</span></p><div class="pagination">
