  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander felt his mouth go dry; he was struggling to control his desire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, Lara turned around, holding up a cute set of cartoon animal pajamas and smiling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you like it? I specifically got it for you; it's silk, really comfortable to wear at night."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing the cartoonish pajamas, Alexander was taken aback, feeling both amused and exasperated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could imagine how awkward it would be for a grown man to wear something like that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aside from Ava, Lara was the second person to buy him clothes, surprising him with her gentle side.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why don't you try it on and see if it fits?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lara touched Alexander's collar, blushing as she asked, "Oh! What's this? It's beautiful!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She spotted the yellow gemstone hanging around Alexander's neck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The yellow gemstone, engraved with thirty-six </span><span>Spellweave</span><span> Patterns, was tied with a red string as a necklace, which Lara had now noticed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's so pretty! Will you give it to me? You've never given me a gift..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lara looked at Alexander with eager anticipation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking of how she had given him her first time and now bought him clothes, Alexander's heart softened, and he took off the gemstone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, it's yours. Wearing it every day will keep you healthy and safe."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wasn't just saying that; the gemstone's </span><span>Spellweave</span><span> Patterns could absorb the earth's energy, which was beneficial for the body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even in dangerous situations, the gemstone could unleash unexpected power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giving it away wasn't a big deal; as long as he had the money, the Ulysses family could provide gems of that caliber in bulk, and Alexander needed to practice carving </span><span>Spellweave</span><span> Patterns anyway.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wow! Really? It's for me? It's so beautiful, I love it..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lara genuinely praised it, admiring the gemstone as she turned it over in her hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Golden patterns flickered within the yellow stone, truly mesmerizing and mysterious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This must be the work of some Master; it must be really expensive, right?" Lara asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm that Master; I made it myself," Alexander replied with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You made it? How many things can you do? It's amazing... But since you made it yourself, I'll take it. You still owe me," Lara said, cradling the gemstone, grinning as she stole glances at Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was going to ask her what she owed him but suddenly remembered she had given him her first time, leaving him speechless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Lara's expression suddenly turned serious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, I came to talk to you today because my grandfather announced that the new family head will be established on the first of next month.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"From my grandfather's attitude, it seems he will pass the position to me, but Orion definitely won't back down."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The first of next month?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander pondered for a moment; it was already mid-month. Once the facial masks were ready, he could go to Treasure Island and still make it back to </span><span>Loscity</span><span> in time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, I'll definitely help you. Orion wanted to team up with </span><span>Houtte</span><span> and David, but now they're both out of the picture, so you don't need to worry too much."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lara nodded vigorously; all her hopes rested on Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ava has a lot of meetings today, so I had some dishes prepared for us to eat together."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Alexander could object, Lara made a phone call.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, several servants arrived carrying beautifully arranged food boxes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When they opened the boxes, they revealed an exquisite four-dish meal and soup that looked like it was made by a chef.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lara shot Alexander a glare.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What are you waiting for? Afraid I poisoned the food?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She consciously glanced at Alexander, recalling the ecstasy from that day, wishing she could lie in his arms right now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come on, you're not hungry? I am!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lara swayed her hips as she arranged the dishes and even opened a bottle of red wine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her curvy, sexy figure was irresistibly charming as she moved about.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander licked his dry lips; he had appreciated that flawless ass last time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lara raised her glass and said passionately, "Alexander, I used to be blind to your worth. Thank you for still being willing to help me; here's to you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander felt a bit shy from her words and quickly clinked glasses, downing the drink.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They chatted while enjoying their wine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, Alexander felt Lara's toes rubbing against his calf, and they began creeping higher...</span></p><div class="pagination">
