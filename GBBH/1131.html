  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander gestured to Xavier and led him around the corner toward the bathroom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His keen ears caught soft moans from behind the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sounds grew louder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"God, Tobias... you're amazing. I feel so great... Xavier is useless. He only takes ten minutes to come every time."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fuck me now. No one's around. Give it to me hard!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey, you slut, can't Xavier satisfy you? I can. They enhanced me - made me bigger, better..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A</span><span> series of crisp crashes were heard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Xavier's face darkened drastically. He knew from the voices that it was Tobias and Olivia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Xavier's expression told Alexander what was going on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He sighed, patted Xavier on the shoulder, and comforted him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Xavier, just as I expected, you've been fooled!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In annoyance, Xavier rushed forward and kicked the bathroom door hard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a bang, the door, which was not very strong, collapsed to the floor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A young red-haired woman was sitting naked on a toilet seat, her hands clasping her thighs folded in front of her.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A man with a brush cut, whose pants had been taken off, was having sex with her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He grasped her breasts with such force that they became deformed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You! Why are you here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the sight of Xavier, Olivia and Tobias panicked and froze there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Xavier sneered, "I already know what you have done. If you don't want to die, tell me the truth. Who sent you here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Olivia glanced down, not daring to look at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tobias came back to his senses and said with a wicked grin, "Xavier, are you trying to scare me? To be honest, I'm from the Sakra Society."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm here undercover. You've been infected and poisoned by the potion of</span><span> us</span><span>."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Without the specific antidote, you will die of the poison within ten days and become a living dead!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, Xavier, if you want to live, </span><span>you need to be good</span><span>."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tobias threatened Xavier arrogantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then h</span><span>e hit Olivia's butt hard and said provocatively, "Xavier, Olivia told me you are impotent. She enjoys </span><span>more </span><span>being fucked by me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You bastard!" Xavier roared before punching Tobias in the face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not expecting Xavier to attack him, Tobias staggered with blood flowing from the corner of his lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He pointed at Xavier with a fierce expression. "You will be dead. Dead..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander grabbed Tobias' fingers and gently broke them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a shrill scream, Tobias fell to the floor in pain, rolling around while covering his broken fingers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unwilling to let him off, Xavier rushed forward to punch and kick him while scolding, "Asshole, I am not afraid of you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn strengthening potion! Alexander has already cured me. Do you think a good-for-nothing like you can control me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tobias was so badly beaten that he curled up into a ball like a boiled shrimp.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He glanced back at Olivia viciously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She trembled all over in fear and stammered, "X-Xavier, he forced me. I didn't </span><span>mean</span><span> it..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Xavier slapped her hard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bitch, are you still trying to lie to me? You and he are in cahoots!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Olivia rushed to Xavier, hugged his thighs, and begged, "Xavier, I was forced. I was really forced... Tobias warned that if I didn't listen to him, he would kill me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She burst into tears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Xavier frowned and softened a little. Despite catching her having sex with Tobias, he did not find any evidence that she had colluded with Tobias.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that time, Alexander glanced at the office outside and made a discovery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He grabbed Tobias' hair, picked up Olivia, and dragged them directly to the office.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, he opened the lid of her desk and took out a vial of light red potion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The ten-milliliter bottle was nearly empty, with just a drop left - barely the size of a fingernail. The rest had clearly been used to poison Xavier.</span></p><div class="pagination">
