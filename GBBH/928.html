  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Keith stood stiffly in the living room, looking around nervously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The living room was bigger than a basketball court. The luxurious decoration and exquisite furnishings, as well as those imposing bodyguards, made him even more uneasy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander appeared in front of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Keith was stunned and looked at him stupidly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander laughed and said, "Why are you stunned? Don't you recognize me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Keith was so excited that his whole body was shaking. He quickly knelt in front of Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His posture made Alexander stunned for a few seconds. He didn't expect that Keith would be so excited when Keith saw him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get up, I have something for you to do."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander waved his hand, and an invisible Force lifted Keith from the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Keith immediately patted his chest and guaranteed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your will is everything to me. Just tell me what you want to do and I will do it well."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander said calmly, "Okay, if you can accomplish this, you will become the number one actor in Dragon Film and Television Company, and you will be given some shares in the company, and your salary and bonus will double."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Keith was suddenly surprised and happy and fell to his knees again. It</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Please give me your orders. I will go through anything for you without hesitation!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was very satisfied with Keith's attitude.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Very well, I want you to go undercover in the Sakra Society and find Hazel's whereabouts as soon as possible."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next day, Keith, dressed in a suit and looking like a successful man, hooked up with a petite woman in a bar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two of them sat side by side, snuggling at the door of the bar, chatting and watching the men and women coming in and out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Keith was holding a bottle of wine in his hand, and he drank it one sip at a time while chatting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Keith was different </span><span>now,</span><span> he was now a rich and handsome man with many fans.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He changed into a set of branded clothes, got a nice hairstyle, and his temperament was much better than before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was not ugly, and now he was even more elegant, humorous, and interesting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The woman he was chatting with had a plump figure but was only above average in appearance, so she was somewhat flattered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This woman never expected that such a young and handsome guy would be interested in her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, the woman had seen Keith's new film, so she couldn't control her excitement and would glance at Keith's crotch from time to time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After the two chatted for a while, they hugged each other tighter and Keith put his hand on her butt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The atmosphere was warmed up, and her eyes were fixed on him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Chaalis</span><span>, I would like to invite you to sing at a club, is that ok?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Keith's proposal made </span><span>Chaalis</span><span> very satisfied. She had long been looking forward to having something romantic happen with Keith, and a club was a great place for a date.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come on, my princess!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He took her hand, very gentlemanly, like a real aristocrat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inadvertently, he glanced at the crystal tag on her neck, which had the number thirty-nine engraved on it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He sneered secretly, but always kept a smile on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it wasn't for Alexander's order to infiltrate the Sakra Society and capture the man nicknamed 'Lone Wolf', how could he have fallen for such a cheap woman?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To successfully switch from Dragon Film and Television Company to Sakra Society, he would need someone to guarantee his acceptance, and </span><span>Chaalis</span><span> was his best recommender.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two got in the car, and Keith took </span><span>Chaalis</span><span> to a luxurious club.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After entering the private room, without the interference of outsiders, the atmosphere between the two became more harmonious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chaalis</span><span> also completely relaxed. Keith ordered some wine and snacks, and the two continued to drink and chat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Keith, who was experienced, ordered cocktails.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The alcohol content of this wine was not high, but it was higher than beer, so it would not make women feel resistant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Keith had already seen that </span><span>Chaalis</span><span> was already feeling amorous, but her will had not yet completely collapsed, so he had to try harder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At Keith's suggestion, the two started playing dice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Chaalis</span><span>, you have a very plump figure. I like your plump figure... It's very comfortable to hold you in my arms..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Keith chuckled and looked at </span><span>Chaalis</span><span> with a deliberately obsessed look, then pinched her round butt.</span></p><div class="pagination">
