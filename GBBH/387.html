  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hahaha!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander couldn't help but burst out laughing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What are you laughing at?" Eddie asked, his heart pounding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander gestured. "Bring that guy over."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marvin immediately brought Calvin forward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Calvin, you useless coward! Weren't you supposed to be The Cripples' top fighter? Pathetic!" Eddie cursed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvin said nothing, walking straight to Eddie. He took the dagger Logan handed him </span><span>and drove it straight into Eddie's chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ahh!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eddie collapsed to the ground, clutching his bleeding chest and staring in terror at Calvin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvin's expression twisted with fury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Boss, sorry, but Mr. Hawthorne said if I kill you and hand over the list of The Cripples' members, he'll spare me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eddie's face twisted as he fell heavily to the floor, unwilling to accept his fate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvin fell to his knees before Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne, can you let me go now?" Calvin asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander looked at him with a cold stare.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bernard was in on this kidnapping too, wasn't he? Call him. Tell him to come over, or you'll be joining him in hell to meet Satan."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvin shuddered. Alexander was ruthless, forcing Bernard to walk right into his trap.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Calvin knew he had no way out and had to follow Alexander's orders; this was his only shot at survival.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvin didn't even have the courage to try bargaining. He hurriedly pulled out his phone and called Bernard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, the call connected.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Clifford, we've captured Alexander, yes... my boss requests you come over... yes, at the villa. Alright, I'll be waiting!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After hanging up, Calvin was gasping for air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander shot him a scornful glance. No matter what Calvin did, Alexander planned to silence him in the end.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All the members of The Cripples had been disarmed, cuffed, and taken down to the basement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvin served Alexander tea and water like a loyal servant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marvin and Logan led over a hundred members of the Ultimate Alliance, standing around imposing and ready.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each one stood tall and straight, their gazes cold and filled with murderous intent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eddie wasn't completely dead yet, lying on the floor as blood continued to pour from his wounds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He made several weak attempts to call for help, but Alexander ignored him, calmly sipping his coffee as if he hadn't heard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvin occasionally glanced over at </span><span>Eddie,</span><span> his heart filled with indescribable fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, the sound of hurried footsteps could be heard from outside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Boss, I really appreciate you avenging my son this time!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before he even entered, Bernard's excited voice echoed through the hall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bernard walked in with a broad smile, taking big strides.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Immediately, someone blocked the door, and the hall filled with men in black, their intimidating presence unmistakable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bernard froze, his face paling as he saw Eddie lying motionless on the ground and blood everywhere.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bernard, do you want revenge for your son?" Alexander asked with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bernard whipped around, finally noticing Alexander sitting confidently on the sofa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You! What are you doing here? You weren't captured?" Bernard stammered, his face twisting in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His face turned pale.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, I'm head of the Clifford family! You touch a single hair on my head, and the </span><span>Cliffords</span><span> won't forgive you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shut up!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before he could say another word, Marvin grabbed Bernard and slapped him several times.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marvin was always ruthless with enemies, and he hit Bernard so hard that he spat blood, his face swelling up like a pig's.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kneel to my boss!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Logan kicked Bernard hard in the knee.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bernard screamed, dropping heavily to his knees, cold sweat pouring down his face from the pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Relying on the power of the Clifford family, he had always been arrogant, never taking others seriously. Now, he finally felt fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander stood up, hands clasped behind his back, and calmly walked over to Bernard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bernard, your son did countless evil deeds; all I did was ruin his hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You harassed Ava, and I still let you go.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Instead of showing any gratitude, you dared to conspire with The Cripples to kidnap me. Tell me, don't you deserve to die?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's cold gaze radiated pure murderous intent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"W-What are you planning? Murder is against the law. You'll go to prison..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bernard was completely panicked, childishly trying to rely on the law to save him.</span></p><div class="pagination">
