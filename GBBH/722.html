  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Using the Force to remove poison wasn't tricky for Alexander, but with so many infected people in </span><span>Loscity</span><span>, treating them one by one was impractical.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then Alexander's eyes fell on the precious "Heaven's Grass", and an idea immediately struck him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he dried and ground this Heaven's Grass into powder, then combined it with the detoxification formula from the Ultimate Legacy, he could create an antidote powder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By adding this powder to the water treatment plant's reservoir, he could distribute the cure to every household in the city.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Oscar broke the silence with an urgent question.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, how's Gideon doing? Can you cure him?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gideon stared at Alexander hopefully, his eyes filled with anticipation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry, I can fix this," Alexander replied, confidently patting his chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Oscar let out a long sigh of relief, knowing Alexander always delivered on his promises.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gideon felt both excited and skeptical.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He'd already seen the best private doctors and tried the latest medications, but nothing had worked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So</span><span> Gideon couldn't help but doubt Alexander's abilities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He sighed quietly to himself, hoping Oscar's recommendation wasn't wrong. He still </span><span>had too much research to complete and wasn't ready to die yet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander channeled the Force for healing, massaging, and pressing on Gideon's lungs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Waves of the Force flowed into Gideon like an invisible tide, surrounding the poison and wreaking havoc within his body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The others couldn't see it, but Alexander's All-seeing Eyes had a clear view.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evil black tendrils of poison snaked through Gideon's system.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Force, with pinpoint accuracy, wrapped around the poison, dissolving it bit by bit and drawing it out through his pores.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Oscar and the guards held their breath, eyes wide, not daring to make a sound.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Mmm</span><span>! Such a warm, comfortable feeling..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gideon couldn't help but sigh in wonder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sharp pain in his chest was easing up, replaced by an indescribable warmth flowing through his body, bringing incredible comfort.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His throat and lungs, raw from violent coughing, now felt wonderfully relaxed, with no trace of the irritating tickle that had triggered his coughing fits.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Alexander's treatment deepened, Gideon felt a pleasant floating sensation throughout his body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, Gideon had drifted off to sleep, softly snoring.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The guards watched Alexander with bewildered expressions, their emotions mixed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Gideon's constant companions, they knew his illness had kept him awake and suffering for two straight nights.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet here was Alexander, who, with just a simple massage, had worked what seemed like a miracle, putting Gideon into a peaceful sleep.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment Alexander </span><span>arrived,</span><span> they sensed the intense aura of a killer around him that only came from someone who had taken many lives. That was why they immediately went to check things out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were impressed not only by Alexander's fighting skills but also by his miraculous medical abilities. They couldn't help but admire him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander had just finished the treatment, giving Gideon's chest a gentle tap.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gideon suddenly jolted awake from his deep sleep, amazed as he examined his body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His clothes were soaked through with black sweat that gave off a foul stench. It was clearly something toxic that needed to get out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smiled and said, "Mr. Patterson, I've expelled all the poison from your system. How are you feeling?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gideon excitedly moved around, cleared his throat, and realized the unbearable pain in his lungs was gone. His whole body felt lighter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, his expression changed to one of horror as he asked, "Are you saying the epidemic in </span><span>Loscity</span><span> was caused by poison?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander nodded. "The City of Sorcery must be behind this."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Oscar grimly agreed, "It's almost certainly the City of Sorcery, but why would they target </span><span>Loscity</span><span>?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was at a loss for words. He didn't need to guess - the City of Sorcery was definitely targeting him, with </span><span>Loscity</span><span> becoming collateral damage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gideon slammed his palm down angrily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If it's not the City of Sorcery, then it must be the Sakra Society! Mr. Hawthorne, you can't let them get away with this. We need to end this epidemic quickly."</span></p><div class="pagination">
