Buzz!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's phone rang, showing that it was Jane calling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't need to answer to know she was calling about Andrew's arrest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feeling indifferent, he hung up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A moment later, Jane called again. He hung up once more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After several attempts, he finally answered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, why did you let my dad get arrested? Even though we're divorced, he was your father-in-law once. How can you be so heartless?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as the call connected, Jane launched into a barrage of accusations.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's not me who got him caught. He was trying to help the Red Umbrella Group kidnap Ashley, and you're in cahoots with them, aren't you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's tone was icy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane faltered, her anger boiling over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, we signed an agreement with the Red Umbrella Group. Ashley must participate in the research, or we owe them a billion dollars!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If Ashley doesn't go, are you going to pay that billion?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was angry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can't believe how despicable you've become, willing to sell out your own daughter."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shut up, Alexander! You have no right to lecture me!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No matter how eloquently you put it, I have every right to take Ashley. Then you'll need to go to the police to explain that my dad wasn't trespassing or attempting a kidnapping and sincerely apologize to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Otherwise, I won't let this go!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was speechless, filled with a deep disdain for Jane.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Since we can't settle this with words, let's see who has the stronger position. You won't take Ashley; try it if you dare."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane seethed with rage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you think you can intimidate me?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I have the backing of the Red Umbrella Group. I'll rise to the top, and our family will be the new elite in </span><span>Loscity</span><span>. When that time comes, don't say I didn't warn you..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before she could finish, Alexander hung up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane's face turned pale.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bang!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She smashed her phone to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Belinda, looking desperate, asked, "Jane, we only have three days until our agreement with the Red Umbrella Group expires. What do we do now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Phew!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane exhaled deeply, unable to calm herself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander won't let me take Ashley, so I'll target someone else. Ava and Ashley both have bodyguards, but that jerk Alexander values Lily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If we capture her, he'll think twice!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Belinda initially felt hopeful, then frowned. "But Jane, </span><span>Loscity</span><span> is almost under Alexander's control. Who would dare help us?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Humph!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane scoffed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't need anyone else. I'll ask Bowman for help."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Belinda was taken aback. "Bowman is your ex-boyfriend; you broke up. Will he help you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane smiled confidently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He's always been under my thumb. If I ask him to deal with an old woman, he'll definitely assist!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Belinda's spirits lifted; she finally saw a glimmer of hope.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Afterward, Jane dressed up carefully, donning a stylish outfit and high heels, and headed to a bar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey, Jane! What brings you here today?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A bald man greeted her with a grin, his eyes roaming over her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bowman, I need your help. Are you unhappy to see me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane playfully swayed, making his eyes widen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course! Even after all these years, I haven't forgotten your charm. You've always been my favorite!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bowman smirked, stepping closer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane leaned into him, saying, "I was blind to marry that </span><span>jerk</span><span> Alexander. If only I had married you instead."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bowman perked up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Jane, now that you're divorced, are you willing to be with me?"</span></p><div class="pagination">
